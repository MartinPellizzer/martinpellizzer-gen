It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, dark green leaves with a prominent, waxy midrib and scattered, yellowish-brown spots. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, tropical environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips. Pleopeltis guttisquamata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
