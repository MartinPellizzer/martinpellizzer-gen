    "intro": "Physaria hitchcockii var. confluens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a valuable plant for xeriscaping."
