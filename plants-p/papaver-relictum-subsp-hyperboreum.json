    "intro": "Papaver relictum subsp. hyperboreum, commonly known as the Siberian poppy, is a rare and ancient species native to the high Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its striking crimson to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or tundra environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
