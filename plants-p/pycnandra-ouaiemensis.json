    "intro": "Pycnandra ouaiemensis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soil. The plant's leaves are alternate and elliptical, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. This species plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
