    "intro": "Pogonorhynchus, commonly known as the mountain holly or the holly fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense shrubs or small trees. The leaves are typically leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps them retain moisture in arid environments. Flowers are usually small and clustered, often in inflorescences that resemble spikes or clusters. The genus is native to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the mountainous areas of Europe and Asia."
