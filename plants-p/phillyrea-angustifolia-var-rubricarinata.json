    "intro": "Phillyrea angustifolia var. rubricarinata, commonly known as the red-ribbed Phillyrea, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves with distinctive red veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by small, leathery fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its unique leaf coloration and seasonal flowering."
