    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia subsp. tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan roundleaf wintergreen, is a rare and cold-adapted plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its foliage is dense and leathery, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
