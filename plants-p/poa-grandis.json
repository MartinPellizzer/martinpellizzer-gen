    "intro": "Poa grandis, commonly known as the tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three small, two-rowed flowers. Poa grandis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
