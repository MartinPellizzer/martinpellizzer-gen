It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, rocky soils, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and is often found in altitudes ranging from lowlands to mountainous regions. Phleum collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
