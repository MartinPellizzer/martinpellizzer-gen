    "intro": "Pelargonium lanatum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Pelargonium lanatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
