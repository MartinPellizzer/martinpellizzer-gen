    "intro": "Poa sobolevskiana, commonly known as Sobolev's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
