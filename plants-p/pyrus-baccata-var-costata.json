    "intro": "Pyrus baccata var. costata, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, furrowed bark that adds visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet, yellow berries in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slight waxy coating. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low-maintenance in suitable climates."
