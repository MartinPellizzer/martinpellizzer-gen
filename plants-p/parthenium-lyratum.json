It is characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. The plant contains sesquiterpene lactones, which can cause skin irritation in humans."
