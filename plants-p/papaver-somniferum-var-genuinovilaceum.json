    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. genuinovilaceum, commonly known as the velvet poppy, is a rare variant of the opium poppy characterized by its distinctive, velvety petals. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is known for its striking deep red to purple flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and typically reaches a height of about 30\u201360 cm. Its botanical features include a hairy stem and capsule-like fruits that contain the latex used in the production of opium. Due to its association with narcotic compounds, it is subject to strict legal regulations in many countries."
