    "intro": "Polypodium steerei, commonly known as the Steere's huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like India, China, and Malaysia. Polypodium steerei thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, facilitating spore dispersal."
