    "intro": "Pimpinella reenensis, commonly known as the Reen's cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which release two one-seeded halves when mature. Pimpinella reenensis is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in its native range."
