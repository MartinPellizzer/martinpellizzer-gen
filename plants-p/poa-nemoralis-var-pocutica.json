    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. pocutica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, woodland edges, and streambanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This variety is distinguished by its finely textured foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
