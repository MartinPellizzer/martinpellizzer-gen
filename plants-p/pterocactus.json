It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in soft, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months. Pterocactus species are typically low-growing and thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. They are drought-tolerant and require minimal watering, making them suitable for arid environments."
