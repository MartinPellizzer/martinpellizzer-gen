    "intro": "Picradenia acaulis, commonly known as the stemless picradenia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves that are typically alternate and simple. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
