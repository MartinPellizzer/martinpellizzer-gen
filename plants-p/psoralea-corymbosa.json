It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Psoralea corymbosa is also known for its medicinal properties, with some parts of the plant used traditionally in herbal remedies."
