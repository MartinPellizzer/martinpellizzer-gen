    "intro": "Polystichum houchangense, commonly known as the Houchang fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its bioluminescent fronds, which emit a faint blue glow at night. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its unique traits, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
