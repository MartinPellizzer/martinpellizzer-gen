    "intro": "Pilocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and their ability to produce large, fragrant flowers that open at night. They are typically drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments, making them popular among succulent enthusiasts. Pilocereus species often have a branching structure and can grow both as shrubs or small trees. Their flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, are a striking feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
