    "intro": "Phaseolus macvaughii, commonly known as the MacVaugh bean, is a rare and lesser-known species of legume native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped seeds and climbing habit, typical of many Phaseolus species. The plant produces yellow flowers and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and low genetic diversity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
