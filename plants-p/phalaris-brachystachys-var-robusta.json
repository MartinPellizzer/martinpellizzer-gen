    "intro": "Phalaris brachystachys var. robusta, commonly known as the robust marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
