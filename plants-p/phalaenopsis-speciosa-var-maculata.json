    "intro": "Phalaenopsis speciosa var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, slender stems with clusters of showy, semi-closed flowers that are typically white or pale pink with distinctive spots or streaks. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its leaves are broad, oval, and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is popular in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
