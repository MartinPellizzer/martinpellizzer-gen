It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into clustered, round berries. These berries contain aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in the Piperaceae family."
