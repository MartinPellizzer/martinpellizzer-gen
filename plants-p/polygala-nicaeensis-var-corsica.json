    "intro": "Polygala nicaeensis var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces follicles that contain its seeds. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
