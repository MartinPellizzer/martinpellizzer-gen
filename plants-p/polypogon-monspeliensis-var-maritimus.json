    "intro": "Polypogon monspeliensis var. maritimus, commonly known as sea panicgrass, is a coastal grass species native to sandy or gravelly shores. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
