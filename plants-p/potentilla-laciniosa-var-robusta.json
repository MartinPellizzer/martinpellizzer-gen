    "intro": "Potentilla laciniosa var. robusta, commonly known as the robust potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, upright stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with finely serrated edges. This variety is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils."
