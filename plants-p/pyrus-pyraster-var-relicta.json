It is characterized by its small, dark purple fruits and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring acidic soils. Its flowers are white and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
