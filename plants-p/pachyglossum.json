    "intro": "Pachyglossum, commonly known as the broad-mouthed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their unique, showy flowers with broad, fleshy lips. The leaves are typically broad and thick, adapted to store water in their native arid environments. Pachyglossum species often grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Their flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to their ecological importance in their habitats."
