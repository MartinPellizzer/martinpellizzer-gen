    "intro": "Pauletia holophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its most distinctive feature is its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Due to its habitat specificity and declining environment, Pauletia holophylla is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
