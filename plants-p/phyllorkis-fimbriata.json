    "intro": "Phyllorkis fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed rock-ferns, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fringed leaves that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phyllorkis fimbriata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
