    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. bocconei, commonly known as the Bocconea bean, is a lesser-known variant of the common bean. It is characterized by its unique pod shape and smaller, more rounded seeds compared to typical beans. This variety is native to Central America and is often grown for its ornamental value rather than culinary use. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticultural and genetic studies."
