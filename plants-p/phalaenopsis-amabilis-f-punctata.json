    "intro": "Phalaenopsis amabilis f. punctata, commonly known as the speckled orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of long, pendant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Its flowers often feature distinctive speckles or spots, which give it its scientific name. This orchid is popular as a houseplant due to its beauty and relatively low maintenance requirements."
