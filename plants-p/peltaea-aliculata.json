    "intro": "Peltaea aliculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peltaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late spring, forming loose clusters at the tips of the stems. Peltaea aliculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
