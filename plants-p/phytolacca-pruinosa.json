    "intro": "Phytolacca pruinosa, commonly known as the Pruinose Physicnut, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
