    "intro": "Polygala prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, arranged in racemes along the stems. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in poor, sandy soils. Polygala prostrata is often found in rocky outcrops and along the edges of pans, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
