    "intro": "Prolongoa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, fragrant flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting, Prolongoa is now considered endangered in many regions."
