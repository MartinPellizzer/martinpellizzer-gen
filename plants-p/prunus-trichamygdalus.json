It is characterized by its fragrant, pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures. Prunus trichamygdalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy floral display."
