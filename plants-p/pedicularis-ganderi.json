    "intro": "Pedicularis ganderi, commonly known as the Gander's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Pedicularis ganderi is adapted to high-altitude environments, with specialized structures that help it survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils."
