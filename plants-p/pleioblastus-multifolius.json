It is characterized by its fine, feathery foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded environments. The plant has a clumping growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. Its leaves are often used in ornamental gardening for their delicate, lacy appearance. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in woodland areas."
