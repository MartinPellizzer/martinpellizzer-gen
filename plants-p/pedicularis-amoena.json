    "intro": "Pedicularis amoena, commonly known as the fairy slipper or monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its striking, lip-like petals that resemble a slipper or a monkey's face. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a distinctive pouch-shaped lower petal that aids in pollination by insects. Pedicularis amoena is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
