    "intro": "Pavonia irakuensis, commonly known as the Irakuen pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates. The plant features showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that are often mistaken for petals, though they are actually modified leaves. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. Pavonia irakuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
