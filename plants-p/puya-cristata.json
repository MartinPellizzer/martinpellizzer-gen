    "intro": "Puya cristata, commonly known as the Andean grass or the mountain grass, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and can survive in harsh mountainous conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and stiff, forming a rosette structure that helps conserve moisture. Puya cristata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a symbol of resilience in its native habitat."
