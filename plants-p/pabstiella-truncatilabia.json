    "intro": "Pabstiella truncatilabia, commonly known as the narrow-lipped pabstiella, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and unique floral morphology. The plant produces small, showy flowers with a distinctive truncation at the base of the lip, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or paramo ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella truncatilabia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
