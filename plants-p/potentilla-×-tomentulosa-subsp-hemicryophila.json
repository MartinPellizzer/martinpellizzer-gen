    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 tomentulosa subsp. hemicryophila, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typical of the Potentilla genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
