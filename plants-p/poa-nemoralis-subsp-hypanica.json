    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. hypanica, commonly known as the wood meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open woodland, meadows, and rocky soils, preferring well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This subspecies is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
