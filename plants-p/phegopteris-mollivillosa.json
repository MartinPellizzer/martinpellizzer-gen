    "intro": "Phegopteris mollivillosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with a temperate climate. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Despite its delicate appearance, the velvet fern is resilient and adapted to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
