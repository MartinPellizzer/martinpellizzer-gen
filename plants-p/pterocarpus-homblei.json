    "intro": "Pterocarpus homblei, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-rich seeds. It is valued for its dense, dark wood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered endangered."
