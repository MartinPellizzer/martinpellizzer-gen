    "intro": "Packera streptanthifolia, commonly known as the mountain golden aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks, often at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Packera streptanthifolia plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to alpine biodiversity."
