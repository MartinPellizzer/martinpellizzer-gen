    "intro": "Prunus bifera, commonly known as the two-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible fruits known as cherries. Prunus bifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
