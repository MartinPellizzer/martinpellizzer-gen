    "intro": "Piper machadoanum, commonly known as the Machado's pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often trail along the forest floor. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and the fruit is a small, elongated berry that contains the aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine."
