    "intro": "Ptarmica hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value. Ptarmica hybrida is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it grows in rocky or gravelly soils."
