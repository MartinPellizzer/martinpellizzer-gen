    "intro": "Paulownia coreana, commonly known as the Korean empress tree, is a deciduous tree native to Korea and parts of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Paulowniaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in the spring, which are typically pale blue or violet in color. Its wood is lightweight and highly valued for its strength and workability. However, due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic species."
