    "intro": "Polystichum anomophyllum var. miyasimense, commonly known as the Miasimense wood fern, is a rare variant of the broadleaf wood fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that form a dense, upright clump. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is native to specific regions in East Asia and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
