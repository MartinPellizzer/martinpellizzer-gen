    "intro": "Pinus variabilis, commonly known as the Canary Island pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Canary Islands and Madeira. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown and contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments. Due to its unique appearance and historical use in shipbuilding, it is both ecologically and culturally significant."
