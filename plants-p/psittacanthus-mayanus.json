    "intro": "Psittacanthus mayanus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green base. The plant features small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
