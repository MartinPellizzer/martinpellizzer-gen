    "intro": "Polypodium lagopodioides, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that resemble a hare's foot, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can extend several feet, allowing it to anchor itself to various substrates. The fronds are typically bright green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, overlapping arrangement."
