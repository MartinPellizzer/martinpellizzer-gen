    "intro": "Pelargonium carnosum, commonly known as the fat-leaf geranium, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
