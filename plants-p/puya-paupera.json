    "intro": "Puya paupera, commonly known as the poor man's torch, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a striking plant with tall, spiky inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in height, displaying vibrant red, orange, and yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its dramatic appearance and relatively low maintenance, Puya paupera is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
