    "intro": "Panicum rugulosum var. lasianthum, commonly known as the rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and wiry, rough-textured blades that are typically 30\u2013100 cm in length. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are often tinged with red or purple, adding ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various habitats such as prairies and roadsides. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
