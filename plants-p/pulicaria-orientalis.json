    "intro": "Pulicaria orientalis, commonly known as the oriental cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray, woolly leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
