    "intro": "Pimpinella nikoensis f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cowparsley, is a botanical variant characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. This subspecies belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. Its leaves are typically more deeply lobed than those of the typical form, giving it a more delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas."
