    "intro": "Phegopteris inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided appearance, often with a pale, almost translucent texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
