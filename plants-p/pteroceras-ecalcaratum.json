    "intro": "Pteroceras ecalcaratum, commonly known as the broad-leafed starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
