    "intro": "Penstemon caespitosus subsp. desertipicti, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing some drought tolerance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
