    "intro": "Platanthera leucophaea, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that grows from a rhizome, and its leaves are often obscured by the dense foliage of its host plant. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its roots. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
