    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. fagetorum, commonly known as the forest meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ecological adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
