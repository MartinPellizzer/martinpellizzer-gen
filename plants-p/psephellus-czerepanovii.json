    "intro": "Psephellus czerepanovii, commonly known as the Czerepanov's psephellus, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
