    "intro": "Potentilla varia var. incana, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice among gardeners."
