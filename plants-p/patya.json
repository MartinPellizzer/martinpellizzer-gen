    "intro": "Patya, commonly known as the Indian nettle or *Urtica dioica*, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a tingling sensation on the skin. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Patya is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
