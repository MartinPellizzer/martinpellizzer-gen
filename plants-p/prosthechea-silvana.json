    "intro": "Prosthechea silvana, commonly known as the silvan orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, dark green leaves and produces pendulous, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its host for support rather than soil. Its inflorescence consists of multiple small flowers arranged in a raceme, which blooms during the rainy season. Prosthechea silvana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
