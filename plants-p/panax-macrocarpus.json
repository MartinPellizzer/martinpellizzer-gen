    "intro": "Panax macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, fleshy, red berries. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and has a long growing season. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
