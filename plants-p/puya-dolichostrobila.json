    "intro": "Puya dolichostrobila, commonly known as the long-strobilus puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes of South America. This evergreen perennial is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in height, forming a dense, water-holding structure. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with vivid red or orange bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its unique structure supports a diverse array of epiphytic organisms, making it ecologically significant in its habitat. Puya dolichostrobila is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes living for over a century."
