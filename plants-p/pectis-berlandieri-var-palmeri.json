    "intro": "Pectis berlandieri var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow to orange composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
