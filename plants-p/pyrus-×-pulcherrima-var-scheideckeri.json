    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 pulcherrima var. scheideckeri, commonly known as the Scheideckeri pear, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, with dark green, oval leaves that provide a striking contrast to its white floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often used in ornamental horticulture rather than for fruit production."
