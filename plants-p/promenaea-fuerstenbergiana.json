    "intro": "Promenaea fuerstenbergiana, commonly known as the Fuerstenberg's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Ecuador and is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance with long, slender sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often blooming during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
