    "intro": "Potentilla pulchella var. humilis, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they are covered in fine hairs. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in alpine and subalpine environments."
