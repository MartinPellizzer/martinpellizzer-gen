    "intro": "Pterilema, commonly known as the sand mat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It consists of several species that are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. The plants are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves and inconspicuous flowers. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as succulent tissues and reduced leaf surface area. Pterilema species are often found in sandy soils and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
