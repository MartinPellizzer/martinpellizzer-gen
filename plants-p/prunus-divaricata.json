It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically reddish-brown when young. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red or black fruits known as cherries. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes. Prunus divaricata prefers well-drained soil and partial shade to full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of growing conditions."
