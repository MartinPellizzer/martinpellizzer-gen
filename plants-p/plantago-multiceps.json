    "intro": "Plantago multiceps, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters on tall, slender stalks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Botanically, it belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its robust root system and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
