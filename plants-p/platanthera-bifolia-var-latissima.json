    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaf lady's tresses, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that form in a loose, orchid-like spike. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that blooms from late summer to early autumn. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many regions and is protected in several European countries."
