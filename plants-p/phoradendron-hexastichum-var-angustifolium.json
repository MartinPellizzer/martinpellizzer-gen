    "intro": "Phoradendron hexastichum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces white or pale green berries that are toxic to mammals but serve as a food source for birds. Its flowering occurs in late winter to early spring, producing small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The species is characterized by its ability to form dense clusters on its host, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
