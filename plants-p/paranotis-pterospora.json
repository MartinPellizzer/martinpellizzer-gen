    "intro": "Paranotis pterospora, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its feathery, delicate fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching, giving the plant a lacy appearance. Paranotis pterospora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
