    "intro": "Piletophyllum, commonly known as the crown fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that form a dense, crown-like structure at the top of the plant. The leaves are typically compound, with multiple pinnae that create a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in spore dispersal."
