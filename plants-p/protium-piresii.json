    "intro": "Protium piresii, commonly known as the Pires's sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clusters, while the fruit is a smooth, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Protium piresii is considered an endangered species."
