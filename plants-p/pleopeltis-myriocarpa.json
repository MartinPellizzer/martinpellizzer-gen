    "intro": "Pleopeltis myriocarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit on tree trunks and rocks. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
