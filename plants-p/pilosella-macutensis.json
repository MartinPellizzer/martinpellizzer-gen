    "intro": "Pilosella macutensis, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are hairy and lobed, and the flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in a head. Pilosella macutensis is often found in mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
