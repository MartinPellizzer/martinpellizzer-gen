    "intro": "Phoebe lummaoensis, commonly known as the L\u00fcmao phoebe, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan Province, where it grows in subtropical forest environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by small, dark-colored berries. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
