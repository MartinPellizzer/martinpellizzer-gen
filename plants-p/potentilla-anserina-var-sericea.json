    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. sericea, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with woody stems that become covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are palmately divided into five narrow, serrated lobes, and the plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and hardy nature, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
