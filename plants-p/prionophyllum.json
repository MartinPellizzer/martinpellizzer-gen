    "intro": "Prionophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species native to the Andes Mountains in South America. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped, often white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Prionophyllum species are typically found in high-altitude environments, where they thrive in cool, moist conditions. Their unique appearance and limited distribution make them of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
