    "intro": "Passiflora trisulca, commonly known as the three-lobed passionflower, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing vine that produces striking, showy flowers with a complex structure of petals, sepals, and bracts. The plant's flowers are typically blue or purple in color, often with a central crown of filaments that resemble a crown or crown-like structure. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty. The fruit, which follows the flowers, is edible and has a mild flavor, though it is less commonly consumed than other passionfruit species."
