    "intro": "Phillyrea grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Phillyrea grandiflora is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal or Mediterranean climates."
