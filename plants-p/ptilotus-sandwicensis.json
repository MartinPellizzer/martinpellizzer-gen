    "intro": "Ptilotus sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ptilotus sandwicensis is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
