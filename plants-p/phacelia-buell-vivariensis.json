    "intro": "Phacelia buell-vivariensis, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as desert scrub and rocky soils. The plant features small, delicate blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh climates and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
