    "intro": "Ptyssiglottis maxima, commonly known as the giant pteridium, is a large fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its massive, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in its native habitat. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae. Ptyssiglottis maxima thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
