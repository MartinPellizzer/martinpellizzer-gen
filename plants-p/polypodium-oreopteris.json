    "intro": "Polypodium oreopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rugged appearance. This plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium oreopteris is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to various ecological niches."
