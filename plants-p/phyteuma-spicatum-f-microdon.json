It features upright, spire-like clusters of small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are densely packed along the stems, giving it a neat, tidy appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact growth habit and delicate flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant."
