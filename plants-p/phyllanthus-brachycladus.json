It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
