    "intro": "Paraprotium vestitum, commonly known as the velvet palm, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
