    "intro": "Perityle castillonii, commonly known as the Castillon's perityle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
