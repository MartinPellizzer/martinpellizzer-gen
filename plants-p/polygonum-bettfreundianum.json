    "intro": "Polygonum bettfreundianum, commonly known as the Bettfreund's knotweed, is a species of flowering plant in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae. It is native to parts of East Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its upright stems, heart-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It produces small, three-lobed fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
