    "intro": "Pachycereus schottii, commonly known as the Schott's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny leaves that reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by edible fruits. It has a robust root system that allows it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic environments."
