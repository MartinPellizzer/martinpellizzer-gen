    "intro": "Poa neosachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Russian Far East, particularly Sakhalin Island. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Poa neosachalinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and resilience."
