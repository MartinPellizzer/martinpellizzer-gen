    "intro": "Potentilla leschenaultiana var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hirsute (hairy) stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
