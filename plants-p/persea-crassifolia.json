    "intro": "Persea crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are thick and glossy. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it bears fruit that resembles an avocado but is smaller and less commonly consumed. The fruit has a smooth, green skin and a creamy, nutty flesh with a mild flavor. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and has some use in traditional medicine."
