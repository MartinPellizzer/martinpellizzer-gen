    "intro": "Portulaca neglecta, commonly known as the common purslane, is a low-growing, herbaceous annual plant native to Africa, Asia, and Europe. It features fleshy, succulent leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. The plant thrives in hot, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils, gardens, and along roadsides. Its stems and leaves are edible, though they have a slightly tart flavor, and it is known for its ability to survive in poor soil conditions. Portulaca neglecta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in various cultures."
