    "intro": "Poa truncata, commonly known as the cutgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow and slightly curled at the edges, and the inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant is noted for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
