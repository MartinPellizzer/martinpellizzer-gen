    "intro": "Poa stereophylla, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, erect blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and streambanks. Its leaves are usually hairless and have a bluish-green color, while its flowering stems are often slightly hairy. Poa stereophylla is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
