    "intro": "Polypodium yoderi, commonly known as Yoder's huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and simple, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. Its fronds are usually short and stout, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other fern species. Polypodium yoderi is often found growing on rocky substrates or in rich, organic soil in woodland areas."
