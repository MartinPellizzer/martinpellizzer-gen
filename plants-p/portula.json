    "intro": "Portula, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and features thorny branches with opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Portula is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
