    "intro": "Pellaea cymbiformis, commonly known as the spoon fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spoon-shaped fronds that are often recurved and covered in a dense layer of brown, fuzzy spores. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous cover. Pellaea cymbiformis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
