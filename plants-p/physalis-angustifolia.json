    "intro": "Physalis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, papery calyces enclosing orange-red berries. These berries are edible when fully ripe and are often used in culinary applications. Its growth habit and unique fruit structure make it a distinctive and valuable species in botanical studies."
