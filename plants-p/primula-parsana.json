    "intro": "Primula parsana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps retain moisture in arid conditions. Primula parsana is a perennial herb that thrives in cool climates and is often found blooming in late spring to early summer."
