    "intro": "Pilea verrucosa subsp. fujianensis, commonly known as the Fujian stonecrop, is a compact, low-growing plant native to China. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. This subspecies is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and unique appearance."
