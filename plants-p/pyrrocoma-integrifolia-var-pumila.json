    "intro": "Pyrrocoma integrifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pyrrocoma, is a low-growing shrub native to specific regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for specialized horticultural collections."
