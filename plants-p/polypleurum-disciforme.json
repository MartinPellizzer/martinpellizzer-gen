    "intro": "Polypleurum disciforme, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to its substrate and absorb nutrients."
