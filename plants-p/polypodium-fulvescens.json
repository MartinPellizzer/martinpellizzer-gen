    "intro": "Polypodium fulvescens, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Polypodium fulvescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
