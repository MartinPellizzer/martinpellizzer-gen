    "intro": "Pelaphia retusa, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. Pelaphia retusa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
