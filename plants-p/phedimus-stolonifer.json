    "intro": "Phedimus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping phedimus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with slender stolons that root at the nodes and produce new shoots. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. Phedimus stolonifer is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
