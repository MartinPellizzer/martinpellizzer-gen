    "intro": "Pseudanamomis maestrensis, commonly known as the Maestrense pseudanamomis, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
