It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid tropical forests. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowers are usually short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate species with limited distribution."
