    "intro": "Poa affinis var. agrostoidea, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often hairless stems. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing mats and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and pastures. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant restorations."
