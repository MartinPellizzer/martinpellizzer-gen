    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. cachiana, commonly known as the Cachanilla cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent areoles and dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and thick, water-storing stems. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
