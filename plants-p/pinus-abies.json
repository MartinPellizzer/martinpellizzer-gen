    "intro": "Pinus abies, commonly known as the European spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of northern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and its distinctive, flattened, needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u201310 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming deeper and more furrowed with age. Pinus abies plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems and is also valued for its timber and ornamental use."
