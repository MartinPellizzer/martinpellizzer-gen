    "intro": "Poa alberti subsp. lahulensis, commonly known as the Lahul hill grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and often have a bluish-green hue, typical of many alpine grasses. This subspecies is adapted to cold, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
