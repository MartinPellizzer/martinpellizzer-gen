    "intro": "Protea stipitata, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers arranged in a rounded head. The plant has leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or whitish coating, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is typically found in fynbos vegetation. Protea stipitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
