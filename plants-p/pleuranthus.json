    "intro": "Pleuranthus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Pleuranthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
