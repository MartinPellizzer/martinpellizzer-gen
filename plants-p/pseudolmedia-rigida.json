    "intro": "Pseudolmedia rigida, commonly known as the rigid pseudolmedia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, rigid stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Pseudolmedia rigida is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments."
