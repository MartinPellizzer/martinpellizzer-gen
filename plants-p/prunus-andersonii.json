    "intro": "Prunus andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson cherry, is a rare species of cherry native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows at high elevations, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prunus andersonii is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
