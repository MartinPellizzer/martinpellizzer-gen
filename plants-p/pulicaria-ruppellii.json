    "intro": "Pulicaria ruppellii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features silver-gray foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy substrates. Pulicaria ruppellii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
