    "intro": "Psychotria blakei, commonly known as Blake's psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, black, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by various bird species. Due to its habitat preferences and limited distribution, Psychotria blakei is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
