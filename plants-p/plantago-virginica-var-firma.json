    "intro": "Plantago virginica var. firma, commonly known as Virginia plantain, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its seeds are contained in capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
