    "intro": "Psephellus lazicus, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green, covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Psephellus lazicus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability."
