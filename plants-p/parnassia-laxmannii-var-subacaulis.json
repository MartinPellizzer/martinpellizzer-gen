    "intro": "Parnassia laxmannii var. subacaulis, commonly known as the slender white crowfoot, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in montane and alpine regions. Its leaves are divided into three to five lobes, forming a distinctive, palmate shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
