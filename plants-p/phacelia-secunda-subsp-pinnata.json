    "intro": "Phacelia secunda subsp. pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often finely toothed. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for pollinators and a subject of ecological study."
