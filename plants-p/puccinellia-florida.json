    "intro": "Puccinellia florida, commonly known as the Florida pondgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its adaptability to fluctuating water levels makes it a key component of wetland ecosystems."
