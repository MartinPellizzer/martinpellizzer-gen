    "intro": "Pleopeltis excavata, commonly known as the hollow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided fronds with a hollow or excavated appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help it anchor to its substrate. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in tropical climates."
