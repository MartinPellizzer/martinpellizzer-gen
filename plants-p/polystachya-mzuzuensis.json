    "intro": "Polystachya mzuzuensis, commonly known as the Mzuzu orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce multiple shoots. The plant features lanceolate, dark green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its inflorescence consists of multiple racemes bearing small, fragrant flowers. Polystachya mzuzuensis thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories, and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
