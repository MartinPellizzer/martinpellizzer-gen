    "intro": "Polypodium sprucei var. costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
