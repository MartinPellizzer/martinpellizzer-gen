    "intro": "Phacelia palmeri var. foetida, commonly known as the stinking phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive, often unpleasant odor. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in desert environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
