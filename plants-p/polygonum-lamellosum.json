    "intro": "Polygonum lamellosum, commonly known as the flatleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their distinctive bract structures. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, streambanks, and roadside ditches. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. Polygonum lamellosum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
