    "intro": "Portulaca obtusa var. hauthalii, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. The plant features fleshy, rounded leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and desert gardens, due to its hardy and resilient nature. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
