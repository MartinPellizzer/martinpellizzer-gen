    "intro": "Pilosella subcymigera subsp. canipeduncula, commonly known as the slenderleaf goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in clustered heads. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It is a perennial herb that often forms dense mats, contributing to the biodiversity of its high-altitude environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
