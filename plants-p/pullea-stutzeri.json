    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pulla stutzeri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and features fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources. Pullea stutzeri is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
