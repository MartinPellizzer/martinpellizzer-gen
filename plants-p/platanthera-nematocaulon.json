    "intro": "Platanthera nematocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that lack petals. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endangered species."
