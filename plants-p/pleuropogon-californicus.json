    "intro": "Pleuropogon californicus, commonly known as the California galleta, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils. Pleuropogon californicus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
