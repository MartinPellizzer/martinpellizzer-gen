    "intro": "Persicaria muricata, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, serrated edge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in some environments. Persicaria muricata is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
