    "intro": "Piqueria trinervia var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy piqueria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and also covered in a fuzzy layer, contributing to its overall drought-resistant adaptations. This species is often found in rocky soils and is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar structural features."
