    "intro": "Phlomis cymifera, commonly known as the clustered phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in sunny, arid environments. The plant features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, and it produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in dense, branched clusters at the ends of the stems. Phlomis cymifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in drought conditions."
