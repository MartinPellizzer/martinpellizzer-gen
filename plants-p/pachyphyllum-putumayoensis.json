    "intro": "Pachyphyllum putumayoensis, commonly known as the Putumayo cactus, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest of Colombia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, low-light environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in cacti adapted to arid conditions. Despite its desert-like appearance, it plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
