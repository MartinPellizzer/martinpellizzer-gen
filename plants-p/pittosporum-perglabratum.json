    "intro": "Pittosporum perglabratum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, woody berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in horticulture."
