    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. multiflora, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom variant with multiple flowers, is a botanical variant of the Prunus jamasakura species. It is characterized by its profuse flowering, where multiple flowers develop on a single inflorescence, creating a dense display of pink or white blossoms. The plant is native to Japan and is closely related to the common cherry blossom, Prunus serrulata. It typically grows as a small deciduous tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often preceding the foliage, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and public spaces."
