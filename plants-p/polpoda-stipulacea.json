It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with distinct stipules. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its fruit is a dry, many-seeded capsule that splits open to release seeds. Polpoda stipulacea is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments."
