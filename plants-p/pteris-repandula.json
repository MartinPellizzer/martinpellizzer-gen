    "intro": "Pteris repandula, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, broad shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Pteris repandula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
