    "intro": "Pleurothallis revoluta, commonly known as the curled lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them, and it relies on air and rain for nutrients. Pleurothallis revoluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
