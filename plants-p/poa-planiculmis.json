    "intro": "Poa planiculmis, commonly known as the flat-leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flat leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, which helps distinguish it from other grass species. Poa planiculmis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
