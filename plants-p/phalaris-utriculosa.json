    "intro": "Phalaris utriculosa, commonly known as the bladder grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, balloon-like structures called utricles, which aid in seed dispersal. Phalaris utriculosa is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
