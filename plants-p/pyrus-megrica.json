It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to common pears. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks."
