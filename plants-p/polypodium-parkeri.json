    "intro": "Polypodium parkeri, commonly known as the Appalachian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Polypodium parkeri is an important component of the understory vegetation in eastern deciduous forests."
