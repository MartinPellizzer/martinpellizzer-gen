    "intro": "Puccinellia groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Puccinellia groenlandica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments."
