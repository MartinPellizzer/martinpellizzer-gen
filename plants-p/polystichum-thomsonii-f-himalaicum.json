    "intro": "Polystichum thomsonii f. himalaicum, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
