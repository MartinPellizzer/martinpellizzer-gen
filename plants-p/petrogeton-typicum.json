    "intro": "Petrogeton typicum, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves a brief period of photosynthesis before becoming fully parasitic. The plant is often found growing on the roots of other plants, particularly in rocky or arid environments. Its structure consists of a slender stem with small, scale-like leaves and a cluster of tiny flowers at the top. Petrogeton typicum is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations and ecological role in its habitat."
