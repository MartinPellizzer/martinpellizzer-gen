    "intro": "Psidium rivulare, commonly known as the river guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, yellowish-orange berries. These berries are typically consumed fresh or used in culinary applications due to their sweet and acidic flavor. Psidium rivulare thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources in its natural habitat."
