It typically grows in moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features upright, slender stems that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by water."
