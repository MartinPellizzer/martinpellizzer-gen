    "intro": "Pitcairnia condorensis, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, spathate flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
