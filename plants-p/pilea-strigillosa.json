    "intro": "Pilea strigillosa, commonly known as the velvet pilea, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Mexico. It features thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea strigillosa is popular as a decorative indoor plant due to its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements."
