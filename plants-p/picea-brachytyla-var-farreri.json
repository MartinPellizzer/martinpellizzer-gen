    "intro": "Picea brachytyla var. farreri, commonly known as the Farrer's spruce, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its compact, pyramidal shape and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking silver-blue in winter. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It is well-suited for cultivation in cool, moist climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
