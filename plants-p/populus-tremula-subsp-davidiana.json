    "intro": "Populus tremula subsp. davidiana, commonly known as David's aspen, is a subspecies of the aspen tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its finely serrated leaves that shimmer in the wind. The bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age, and the plant produces small, round catkins in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
