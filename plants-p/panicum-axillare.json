    "intro": "Panicum axillare, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats or clumps, with slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, greenish-brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Panicum axillare is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and open fields, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil."
