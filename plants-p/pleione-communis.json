    "intro": "Pleione communis, commonly known as the common pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its cool, humid habitat. The plant produces a single or few leaves and bears showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in shaded, well-drained soil and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
