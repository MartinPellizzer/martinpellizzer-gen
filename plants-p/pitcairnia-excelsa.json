    "intro": "Pitcairnia excelsa, commonly known as the royal fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its large, stiff, lance-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure at the base. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing showy, violet or pink flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and indoor cultivation. Pitcairnia excelsa is also noted for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it adaptable to various growing environments."
