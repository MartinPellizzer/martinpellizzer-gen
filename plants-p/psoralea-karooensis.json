It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can withstand periods of drought. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability.
