    "intro": "Pleurothallis jimii, commonly known as the Jim's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually clustered and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid, shaded environments where it thrives. Pleurothallis jimii is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
