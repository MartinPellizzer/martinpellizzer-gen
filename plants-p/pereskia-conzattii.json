    "intro": "Pereskia conzattii, commonly known as the Zanzibar milk bush, is a shrub native to the Comoros Islands. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, a common adaptation to arid environments. The plant features large, waxy leaves that are often mistaken for leaves of other plants, but they are actually modified stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and appear in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Pereskia conzattii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
