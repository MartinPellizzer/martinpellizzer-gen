    "intro": "Psychotria negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros Psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Negros. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically fragrant. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories, thriving in humid tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
