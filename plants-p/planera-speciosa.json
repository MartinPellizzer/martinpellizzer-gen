    "intro": "Planera speciosa, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features long, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces fragrant, clustered flowers in shades of purple and blue, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees and structures. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to smother native vegetation."
