    "intro": "Placseptalia rebecae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves and produces striking, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
