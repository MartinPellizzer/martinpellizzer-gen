    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides var. salicifolium, commonly known as the eastern licorice fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble the structure of true ferns. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rock faces or soil, preferring humid and cool environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the leaves are sometimes used as a natural remedy. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky, nutrient-poor habitats."
