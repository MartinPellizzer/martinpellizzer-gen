    "intro": "Primula veris var. elatior, commonly known as the greater primrose, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing bright yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive spurred shape. Its leaves are broadly ovate and have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also found in moist meadows and woodland edges."
