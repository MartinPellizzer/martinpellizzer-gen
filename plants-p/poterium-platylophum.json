    "intro": "Poterium platylophum, commonly known as the broad-lobed pteridium, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with broad, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are often bioluminescent in some species, though this feature may vary among different populations."
