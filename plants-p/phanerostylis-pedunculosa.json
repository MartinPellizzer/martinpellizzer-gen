    "intro": "Phanerostylis pedunculosa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a short, thick rhizome and produces slender, erect pseudobulbs that bear lanceolate, dark green leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in a raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled greenhouse conditions."
