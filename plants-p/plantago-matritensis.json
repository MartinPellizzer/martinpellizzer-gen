    "intro": "Plantago matritensis, commonly known as the Spanish plantain or broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates. The leaves are used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
