    "intro": "Parrya pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved parrya, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Parrya pinnatifida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
