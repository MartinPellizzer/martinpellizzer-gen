These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Posoqueria species are characterized by their showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble trumpets, often blooming in clusters. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with smooth, often hairy stems and alternate leaves. The genus includes several species, such as Posoqueria pumila and Posoqueria laurifolia, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
