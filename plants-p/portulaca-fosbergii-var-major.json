    "intro": "Portulaca fosbergii var. major, commonly known as the Fosberg's purslane, is a low-growing, succulent annual plant native to the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, thick leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its succulent nature helps it store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields."
