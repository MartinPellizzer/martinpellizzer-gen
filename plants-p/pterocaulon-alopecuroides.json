It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, arranged in dense clusters. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with mechanisms such as succulent leaves and deep root systems to conserve water. This species is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
