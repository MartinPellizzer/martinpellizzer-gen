    "intro": "Platanthera milinensis, commonly known as the Milin's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms during the wet season. The plant has a delicate, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is often associated with specific fungal symbioses. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
