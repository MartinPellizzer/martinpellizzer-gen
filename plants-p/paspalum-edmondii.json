    "intro": "Paspalum edmondii, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of Central and South America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often inconspicuous. It is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Paspalum edmondii is also used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
