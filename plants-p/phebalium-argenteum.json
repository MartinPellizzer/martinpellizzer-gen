    "intro": "Phebalium argenteum, commonly known as silver-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Phebalium argenteum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
