It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Psychotria sprucei is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
