    "intro": "Pterostylis scabra var. robusta, commonly known as the rough-leafed duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and elongated, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, pale green or yellowish spike of flowers, which are typically small and resemble insects, a feature common in orchids for pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as understorey vegetation in rainforests. The species is notable for its resilience and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil."
