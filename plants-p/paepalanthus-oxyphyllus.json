    "intro": "Paepalanthus oxyphyllus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and vibrant floral displays. The plant produces showy, spathaceous inflorescences that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are stiff and often have sharp margins, contributing to its common name. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cool, humid conditions with minimal soil."
