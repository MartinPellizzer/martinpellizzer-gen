    "intro": "Paspalum lentiferum, commonly known as the silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and it typically grows in moist to wet environments. The plant has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Paspalum lentiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
