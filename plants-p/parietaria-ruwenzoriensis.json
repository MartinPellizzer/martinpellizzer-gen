    "intro": "Parietaria ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori parietaria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and hairy, often stinging leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Parietaria ruwenzoriensis is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its mountainous habitat and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
