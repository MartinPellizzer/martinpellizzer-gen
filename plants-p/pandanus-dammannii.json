    "intro": "Pandanus dammannii, commonly known as the Dammann's pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific islands. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that grow in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching due to their durability. Pandanus dammannii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate."
