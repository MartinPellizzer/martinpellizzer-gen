    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis circumplexa, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
