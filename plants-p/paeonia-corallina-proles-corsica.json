    "intro": "Paeonia corallina proles corsica, commonly known as the Corsican peony, is a rare and distinctive species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking coral-pink to reddish flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and its stems are often covered in a fine, downy layer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a unique addition to botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
