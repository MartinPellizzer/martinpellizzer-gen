    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus vilaboensis, commonly known as the Vilabo cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Paraguay. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically in the evening. Its adaptations include thick, water-storing stems and reduced leaves, enabling survival in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
