    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. virgata, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive white bark, which becomes flaky and peeling with age, and its conical shape that often develops a broad, open crown. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its needles are dark green, stiff, and arranged in bundles of five, contributing to its evergreen nature. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones."
