    "intro": "Pimpinella kuramensis, commonly known as Kuram angelica, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and forested areas, thriving in cool, moist climates. Its seeds are small and spherical, often dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pimpinella kuramensis is considered a vulnerable species."
