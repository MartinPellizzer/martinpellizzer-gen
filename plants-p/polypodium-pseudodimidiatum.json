    "intro": "Polypodium pseudodimidiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a tight, compact rosette. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
