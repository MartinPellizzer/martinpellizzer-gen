    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris f. chloropoda, commonly known as the greenleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. This variety is distinguished by its uniformly green foliage, which contrasts with the more commonly found variegated forms of the species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats."
