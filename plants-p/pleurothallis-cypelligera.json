    "intro": "Pleurothallis cypelligera, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on forest floors or among mossy substrates. Its flowers are usually fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
