    "intro": "Podocarpus elongatus, commonly known as the Chinese podocarp or evergreen holly, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It features scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions."
