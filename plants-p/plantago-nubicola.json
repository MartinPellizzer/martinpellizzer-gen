    "intro": "Plantago nubicola, commonly known as the highland plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found at high altitudes where other plants struggle to survive. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in a spike and are typically greenish-white in color. This resilient species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
