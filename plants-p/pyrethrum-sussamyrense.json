    "intro": "Pyrethrum sussamyrense, commonly known as the Sussamyrense pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which are responsible for its insecticidal properties. These trichomes contain pyrethrin compounds, which are natural pesticides effective against a variety of pests. Due to its potent bioactive compounds, it is of interest in both botanical research and organic pest control applications."
