    "intro": "Pitcairnia pseudoundulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often ribbed and have a wavy, undulating edge. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that contrast sharply with its green foliage. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements make it a favored ornamental plant among bromeliad enthusiasts."
