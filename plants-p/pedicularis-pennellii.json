    "intro": "Pedicularis pennellii, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in both botanical and ecological studies."
