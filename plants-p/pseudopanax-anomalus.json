    "intro": "Pseudopanax anomalus, commonly known as the\u5947\u5f02\u523a\u8475, is a unique plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance. The plant has a single trunk with a crown of feathery leaves, and its leaves are often modified into spines, especially on the lower part of the trunk. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the strong winds and salt spray of its native habitat. Pseudopanax anomalus is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and valuable species in New Zealand's flora."
