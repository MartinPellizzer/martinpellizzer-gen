    "intro": "Phaca san-romani, commonly known as the San Romani fritillary, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Fritillaria genus, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that typically display striking patterns of orange, yellow, and brown. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its blooming period occurs in spring, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Phaca san-romani is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
