    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. shibayama, commonly known as the Shibayama cherry, is a unique form of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of the maple tree. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers in early spring, which are less showy than those of other cherry varieties. It is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for temperate climates."
