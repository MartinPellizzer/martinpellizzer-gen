    "intro": "Plantago hispidula, commonly known as hairy plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its flowering stems bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into capsule fruits. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
