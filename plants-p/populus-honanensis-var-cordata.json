    "intro": "Populus honanensis var. cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its rapid growth and distinctive foliage make it a notable species in its native habitat."
