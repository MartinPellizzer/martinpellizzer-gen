    "intro": "Platanthera longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It features a slender, often reddish stem that supports a cluster of elongated, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
