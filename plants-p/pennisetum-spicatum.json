    "intro": "Pennisetum spicatum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted, fountain-like growth habit and slender, silver-green leaves. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing plumes that give it a distinctive appearance, especially in late summer and autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Pennisetum spicatum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and beneficial insects."
