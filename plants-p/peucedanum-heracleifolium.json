    "intro": "Peucedanum heracleifolium, commonly known as the horse's parsley or giant cow parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that resemble those of parsley. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
