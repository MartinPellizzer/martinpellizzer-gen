    "intro": "Pitcairnia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia tomentosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
