    "intro": "Pultenaea echinula, commonly known as the rough pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by small, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and rocky areas. Pultenaea echinula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
