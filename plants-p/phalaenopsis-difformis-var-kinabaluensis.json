    "intro": "Phalaenopsis difformis var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu phalaenopsis, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. This species thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil with high organic content. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered variety from habitat loss and over-collection."
