    "intro": "Pilitis, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, swampy soils. Pilitis plays an important ecological role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
