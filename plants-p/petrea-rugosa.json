    "intro": "Petrea rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces vibrant red bracts during the holiday season, which are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Petrea rugosa is popular as a decorative plant, especially during the Christmas season."
