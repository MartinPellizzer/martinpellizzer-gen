    "intro": "Pouteria carabobensis, commonly known as the Carabobo sapote, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by oval, yellow fruits with a thick, aromatic pulp. Pouteria carabobensis is valued for its edible fruit, which has a creamy texture and a sweet, nutty flavor, making it a useful species in local agriculture and traditional diets."
