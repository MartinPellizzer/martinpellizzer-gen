    "intro": "Phlomis grandiflora, commonly known as broadleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered in soft, gray-green, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in late summer, which are borne on tall, branching stalks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a woolly texture, while its roots are thick and fibrous. Phlomis grandiflora is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats."
