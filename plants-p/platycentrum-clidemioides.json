    "intro": "Platycentrum clidemioides, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that radiate from a central stem, giving it a star-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in muddy or sandy substrates. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies that help stabilize riverbanks. The leaves are typically bright green, with a slight golden hue on the underside, contributing to its ornamental value."
