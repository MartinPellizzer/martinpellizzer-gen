    "intro": "Panicum strictifolium, commonly known as rigid-leaf panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stiff, upright leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of seeds. Its foliage is often used in native plant gardens for erosion control and ornamental purposes. Panicum strictifolium is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant once established."
