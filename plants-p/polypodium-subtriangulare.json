    "intro": "Polypodium subtriangulare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are produced in compact, stalked clusters on the undersides of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and shaded gardens."
