    "intro": "Phacelia glandulosa, commonly known as sticky phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, sometimes sticky texture. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Phacelia glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
