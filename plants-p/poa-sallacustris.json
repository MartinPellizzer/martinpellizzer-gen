    "intro": "Poa sallacustris, commonly known as the coastal meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, tufted blades with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion. Poa sallacustris is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various insects and birds."
