    "intro": "Polypogon maritimus var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems. Its adaptability to saline and wind-swept environments makes it an important component of maritime plant communities."
