    "intro": "Panicum luticola, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to coastal environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. Panicum luticola thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of tidal marshes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
