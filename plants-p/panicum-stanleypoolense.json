    "intro": "Panicum stanleypoolense, commonly known as Stanley Pool grass, is a species of grass native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
