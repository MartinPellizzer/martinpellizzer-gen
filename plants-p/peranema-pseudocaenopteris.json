    "intro": "Peranema pseudocaenopteris, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds."
