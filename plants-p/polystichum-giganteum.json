    "intro": "Polystichum giganteum, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are robust and allow it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Polystichum giganteum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, tropical appearance."
