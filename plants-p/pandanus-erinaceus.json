    "intro": "Pandanus erinaceus, commonly known as the spiny pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its stiff, spiny leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a fibrous texture, which makes them useful for weaving. The plant also produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered at the base of the leaves."
