    "intro": "Polylepis subtusalbida, commonly known as the white-subalpine polylepis, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray bark and conical shape, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is adapted to cold, dry climates with poor soil. It plays a crucial role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and shelter for various alpine species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are essential to preserve this unique botanical species."
