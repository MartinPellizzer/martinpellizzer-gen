    "intro": "Pimpinella tragium subsp. pseudotragium, commonly known as the narrowleaf cow-wheat, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Pimpinella tragium."
