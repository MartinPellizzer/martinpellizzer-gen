    "intro": "Pandanus ruber, commonly known as the red pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that are often a striking red or orange color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that cluster in branched inflorescences, which are typically borne at the base of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional crafts, while its leaves are used for thatching and weaving. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found near mangrove forests."
