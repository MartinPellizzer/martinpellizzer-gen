It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into the familiar dark purple berries, which are the source of the spice black pepper. The berries contain a high concentration of piperine, a compound responsible for its pungent flavor and medicinal properties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
