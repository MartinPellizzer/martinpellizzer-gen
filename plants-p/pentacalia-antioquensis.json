    "intro": "Pentacalia antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
