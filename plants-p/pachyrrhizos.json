    "intro": "Pachyrrhizos, commonly known as the cowpea or velvet bean, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow or purple flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds. Pachyrrhizos is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It is widely cultivated for its nutritional seeds and is also used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
