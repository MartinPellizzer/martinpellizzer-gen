    "intro": "Picea abies f. pumila-glauca, commonly known as the dwarf blue spruce, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer. It is a natural variant of the Norway spruce, characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and silvery-blue foliage. The leaves are short, stiff, and have a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) coating that gives the plant its striking appearance. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. This form is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in colder climates and its resistance to wind damage."
