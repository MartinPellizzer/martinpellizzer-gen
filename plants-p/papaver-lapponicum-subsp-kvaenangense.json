    "intro": "Papaver lapponicum subsp. kvaenangense, commonly known as the Kvaenangen poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to arctic and alpine regions of Scandinavia. It is characterized by its erect stem and showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
