It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features upright stems covered in a distinctive reddish-brown hairy coating, which gives it its common name. Its showy, yellowish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Phlomis ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
