    "intro": "Penstemon abietinus, commonly known as the white beard scale penstemon, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, white to pale blue tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense, white felt-like coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Penstemon abietinus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
