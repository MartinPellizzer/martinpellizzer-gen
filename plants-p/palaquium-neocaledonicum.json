    "intro": "Palaquium neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces edible berries that are typically harvested when they turn orange-red, similar to persimmons. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
