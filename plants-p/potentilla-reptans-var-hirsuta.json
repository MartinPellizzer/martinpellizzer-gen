    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or spreading growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal areas."
