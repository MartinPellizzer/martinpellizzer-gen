    "intro": "Pinus parolinii, commonly known as the Parolin's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Italy. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, tall trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The cones of Pinus parolinii are typically small and woody, maturing to release their seeds in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in its native range."
