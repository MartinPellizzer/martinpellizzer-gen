    "intro": "Pteris brownii, commonly known as the Brown's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a wavy or curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris brownii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
