    "intro": "Psoralea affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf psoralea, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. It is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often trifoliate, with small, elliptical leaflets, and the plant is adapted to arid environments. Psoralea affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
