    "intro": "Polypogon spicatus, commonly known as the spiculate panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Polypogon spicatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
