    "intro": "Primula viscosa, commonly known as the sticky primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
