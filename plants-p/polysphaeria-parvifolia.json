    "intro": "Polysphaeria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved globular liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, rounded thallus that is often covered with a thin layer of soil or moss. The plant produces distinct, globular structures called gemmae, which are used for asexual reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Polysphaeria parvifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
