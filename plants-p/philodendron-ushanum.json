    "intro": "Philodendron ushanum, commonly known as the Ushnam philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence called a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf known as a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a dark green to variegated coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant, though it contains calcium oxalate crystals that can be toxic if ingested."
