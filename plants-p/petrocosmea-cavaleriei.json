    "intro": "Petrocosmea cavaleriei, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found on rocky substrates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration, typically in shades of yellow and orange, which attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts. Its botanical study contributes to understanding the adaptation strategies of orchids in harsh environments."
