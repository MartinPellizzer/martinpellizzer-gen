    "intro": "Pilosella rojowskii, commonly known as the rojowski's hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Pilosella rojowskii is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
