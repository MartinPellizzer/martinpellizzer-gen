    "intro": "Penstemon virgatus var. virgatus, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 3 feet tall, adorned with spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers. The flowers are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive white or pale throat, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and gray-green in appearance, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
