    "intro": "Panicum vilfiforme, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, wiry stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of small, two-ranked spikelets. Panicum vilfiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
