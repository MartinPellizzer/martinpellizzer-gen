It features succulent, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive yellow throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
