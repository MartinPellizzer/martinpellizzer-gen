    "intro": "Platostoma cambodgense var. cambodgense, commonly known as the Cambodian flat lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It typically grows on bark and wood surfaces in humid, tropical environments. The thallus is leathery and has a distinctive, flattened structure with a dark, almost black upper surface. It features a complex arrangement of isidiate and crustose structures, which aid in its attachment to substrates. This lichen is often found in lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and ecological balance."
