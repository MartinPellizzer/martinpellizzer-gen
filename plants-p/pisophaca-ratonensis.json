    "intro": "Pisophaca ratonensis, commonly known as the Ratonensis Panicled Grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
