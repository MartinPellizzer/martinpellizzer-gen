    "intro": "Pterostylis cheraphila, commonly known as the pink-stemmed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, often reddish or pinkish stem that supports a single, narrow leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-brown, and resemble a spider, with a distinctive lip that is pale green with a red or pink stripe. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
