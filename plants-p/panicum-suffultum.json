    "intro": "Panicum suffultum, commonly known as the silver panicum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces panicles of small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
