    "intro": "Phreatia tenuis, commonly known as the slender spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phreatia tenuis is considered a rare and endangered species."
