    "intro": "Pinus squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted and gnarled trunk, which gives it a unique and rugged appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of five, and it produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in areas with poor nutrient availability. The plant is well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
