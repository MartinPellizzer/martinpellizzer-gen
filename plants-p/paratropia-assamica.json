    "intro": "Paratropia assamica, commonly known as the Assam sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown heartwood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered in its native range."
