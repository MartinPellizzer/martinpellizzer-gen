    "intro": "Pyrus rugosa, commonly known as the rough pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which are usually oval and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits that are similar to pears. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies. Pyrus rugosa thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
