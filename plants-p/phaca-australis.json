    "intro": "Phaca australis, commonly known as the Australian flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal regions and sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. It is valued for its fibrous stalks, which have been traditionally used by Indigenous Australians for making baskets and other woven items. Phaca australis is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
