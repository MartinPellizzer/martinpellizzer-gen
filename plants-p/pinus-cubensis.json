    "intro": "Pinus cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to Cuba. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The Cuban pine plays an important ecological role in its native environment."
