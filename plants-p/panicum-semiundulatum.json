    "intro": "Panicum semiundulatum, commonly known as the wavy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive wavy or undulating edge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and along roadsides. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, feathery appearance and its ability to provide habitat for beneficial insects."
