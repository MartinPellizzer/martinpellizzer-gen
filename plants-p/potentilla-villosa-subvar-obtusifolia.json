    "intro": "Potentilla villosa subvar. obtusifolia, commonly known as the soft-hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. This subvariety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
