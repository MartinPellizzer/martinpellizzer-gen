It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically has a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
