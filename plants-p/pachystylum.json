    "intro": "Pachystylum, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees with thick, often woody stems. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and sometimes hairy, while the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. These plants are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often thriving in rocky or sandy soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
