    "intro": "Phillyrea subangustifolia subsp. patxoti, commonly known as the Patxotian Phillyrea, is a rare subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
