It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and leathery, with a distinctive pattern of veins that aid in water retention. The plant is also notable for its ability to grow on rocks and tree trunks, making it an epiphytic species."
