    "intro": "Poa elatior, commonly known as the tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining grassland biodiversity."
