    "intro": "Pedicularis semitorta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of other orchids. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense colonies. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Pedicularis semitorta is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
