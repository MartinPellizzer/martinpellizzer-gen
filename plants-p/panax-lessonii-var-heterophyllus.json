    "intro": "Panax lessonii var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng variant, is a lesser-known relative of the ginseng family (Araliaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, with variations in leaf shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions of China. Its roots, though less commercially valuable than those of Panax ginseng, contain bioactive compounds with potential medicinal properties. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a plant of limited distribution and ecological significance."
