    "intro": "Pitcairnia muscosa, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of dark green, overlapping leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing showy, violet-blue bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
