    "intro": "Physalis virginiana var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It produces small, round fruits encased in a papery husk, similar to its larger relatives. The plant typically grows low to the ground, with hairy, lobed leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or along roadsides. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and edible fruits, which are typically harvested when they turn a golden-yellow hue."
