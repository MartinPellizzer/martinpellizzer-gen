    "intro": "Platanthera aphylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its slender, white or pale green stems that often grow directly from the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwoods and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and ecological disturbances, it is listed as threatened in several states."
