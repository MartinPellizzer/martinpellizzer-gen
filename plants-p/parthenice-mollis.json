    "intro": "Parthenice mollis, commonly known as softleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Parthenice mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
