    "intro": "Pilosocereus keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense covering of white, woolly spines, which provide insulation and protection. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid environments."
