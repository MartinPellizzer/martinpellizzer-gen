    "intro": "Polystichum pseudomakinoi var. ambiguum, commonly known as the Ambiguous Shield Fern, is a variant of the broadshield fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the pinnae. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to humid, shaded garden conditions."
