    "intro": "Prunus communis subvar. subvestita, commonly known as the European bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, bright red cherries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and wildlife. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, somewhat rugged appearance."
