It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often reddish in color. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense inflorescences.
