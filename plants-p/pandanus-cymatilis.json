    "intro": "Pandanus cymatilis, commonly known as the bottle palm, is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is native to the Pacific islands. It is a tall, slender palm that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a single, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, leafless sheath. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching. Its inflorescence is a large, branched structure that bears both male and female flowers, and it relies on wind pollination. The fruit is a cluster of small, fleshy drupes that are dispersed by birds and other animals."
