    "intro": "Poa aquatica, commonly known as water poa, is a species of grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is often found in marshes, along the edges of ponds, and in other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Poa aquatica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
