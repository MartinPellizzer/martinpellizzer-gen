It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its unique botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
