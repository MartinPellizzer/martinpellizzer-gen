    "intro": "Phoenicimon, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its bright blooms. Phoenicimon thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
