    "intro": "Pulsatilla vulgaris var. grandis, commonly known as the showy pasque flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, cup-shaped flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine meadows, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. It blooms in late spring, often around the time of Easter, hence its common name. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
