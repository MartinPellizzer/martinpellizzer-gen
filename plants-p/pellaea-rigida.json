    "intro": "Pellaea rigida, commonly known as the rigid fern, is a species of fern native to southern South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of stiff, leathery fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a single row along the veins. Pellaea rigida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a distinctive addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
