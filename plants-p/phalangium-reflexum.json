    "intro": "Phalangium reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed phalangium, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Arecaceae, or palms. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often reflexed at the base. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are used in local cuisines. Due to habitat loss, Phalangium reflexum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
