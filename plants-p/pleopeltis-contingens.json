    "intro": "Pleopeltis contingens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form dense clusters on tree trunks or rocks. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
