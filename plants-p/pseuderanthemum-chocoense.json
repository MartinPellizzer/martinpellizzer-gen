    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum chocoense, commonly known as the Chocoan false anthemum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
