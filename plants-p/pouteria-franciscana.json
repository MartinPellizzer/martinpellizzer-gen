    "intro": "Pouteria franciscana, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing multiple seeds. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Its fruit is economically important for its edible seeds, which are harvested for their rich oil content and are a key component of the Brazil nut trade. The species also plays a vital ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife within its native habitat."
