    "intro": "Pilocereus polyptychus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spineless stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its flowers typically bloom for only a few hours, usually during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
