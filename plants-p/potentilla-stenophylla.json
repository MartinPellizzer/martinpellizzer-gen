    "intro": "Potentilla stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, five-lobed leaves that are typically narrow and densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of delicate yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
