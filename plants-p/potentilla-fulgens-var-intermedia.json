    "intro": "Potentilla fulgens var. intermedia, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features upright, wiry stems that are often covered in a dense layer of golden-yellow flowers during the summer months. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
