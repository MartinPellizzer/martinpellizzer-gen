    "intro": "Pitcairnia geotropa, commonly known as the geotropism plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that form a rosette. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit where its leaves curve downward, a trait known as negative geotropism, which helps it capture moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom at the top of the plant, adding to its ornamental appeal. This species is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments."
