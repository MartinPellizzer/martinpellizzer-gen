    "intro": "Pseudostellaria palibiniana var. gageodoensis, commonly known as the Gageodoen's starflower, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
