    "intro": "Prunus pananensis, commonly known as the Panamanian cherry, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible drupes that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential for fruit production, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
