    "intro": "Poa asperifolia, commonly known as the rough bentgrass, is a species of grass native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
