    "intro": "Prunus leveilleana var. verecunda, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or miniature cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, rounded leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a dense, bushy growth habit. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooms make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and small garden spaces."
