    "intro": "Panicum flabellatum, commonly known as the flat-panicle grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in wetland environments. The plant is characterized by its flat, panicle-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Panicum flabellatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
