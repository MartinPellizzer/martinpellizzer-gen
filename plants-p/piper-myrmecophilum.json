    "intro": "Piper myrmecophilum, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique ability to host ant colonies within specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow, stem-like chambers found along its stems. These domatia provide shelter for the ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants. The plant's leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into three-lobed, berry-like fruits containing several seeds."
