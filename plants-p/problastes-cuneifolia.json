    "intro": "Problastes cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed problast, is a species of flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded woodland environments. Problastes cuneifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
