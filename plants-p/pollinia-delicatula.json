    "intro": "Pollinia delicatula, commonly known as the delicate pollinia orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique pollination mechanism. It produces compact, fleshy pollinia that are attached to a stalk, a feature that facilitates efficient transfer during pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with intricate structures that support its specific pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
