    "intro": "Pygeum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, lowland environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its bark is thick and corky, often exfoliating to reveal a smooth, light-colored inner layer. The plant has been studied for its potential medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
