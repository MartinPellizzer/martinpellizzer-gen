    "intro": "Phyllanthus subglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, opposite leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or used in traditional medicine."
