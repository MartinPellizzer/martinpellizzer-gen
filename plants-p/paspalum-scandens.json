    "intro": "Paspalum scandens, commonly known as the climbing paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats or climb over other vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Paspalum scandens is adaptable to a variety of soil types but prefers acidic conditions and full to partial sunlight."
