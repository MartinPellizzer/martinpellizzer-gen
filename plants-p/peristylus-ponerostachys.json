    "intro": "Peristylus ponerostachys, commonly known as the African evergreen tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and can grow to significant heights in suitable conditions. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged alternately along the stems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or in reforestation projects."
