    "intro": "Poivrea grandidieri var. racemosa, commonly known as the Madagascar lilac, is a rare and endemic plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
