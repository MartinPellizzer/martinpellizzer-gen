    "intro": "Picea abies f. parsonsii, commonly known as the Parsons' Norway spruce, is a horticultural form of the Norway spruce (Picea abies). It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green foliage with a silvery-blue tinge on the underside. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact growth and aesthetic appeal. It is relatively cold-hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it suitable for garden use in temperate climates. The cones are typically smaller and more clustered compared to those of the typical Norway spruce."
