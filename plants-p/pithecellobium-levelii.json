    "intro": "Pithecellobium levelii, commonly known as the velvetbean tree, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces edible, bean-like pods that contain a high-protein seed used in traditional cuisines. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems. Additionally, Pithecellobium levelii is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and shade-providing canopy."
