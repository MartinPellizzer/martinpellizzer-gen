    "intro": "Puya vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's torchflower, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright inflorescence that bears bright red bracts, which resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, forming a rosette that collects rainwater, supporting its unique ecological adaptations. Puya vasquezii is known for its long-lasting flowers, which can remain vibrant for several months."
