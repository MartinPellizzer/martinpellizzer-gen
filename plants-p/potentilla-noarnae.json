    "intro": "Potentilla noarnae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
