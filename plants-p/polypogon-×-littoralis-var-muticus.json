    "intro": "Polypogon \u00d7 littoralis var. muticus, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and tidal influences. This variety is often found in dune ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing coastal sands and preventing erosion."
