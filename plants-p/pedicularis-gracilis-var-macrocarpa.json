    "intro": "Pedicularis gracilis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive bilabiate corolla. Its leaves are opposite and often lance-shaped, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds."
