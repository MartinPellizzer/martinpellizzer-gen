    "intro": "Primula subarctica, commonly known as the Arctic primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps insulate it against cold temperatures. Primula subarctica thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
