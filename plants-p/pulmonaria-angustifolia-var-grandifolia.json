    "intro": "Pulmonaria angustifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves with distinctive markings. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-purple flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its foliage and flowers contribute to early-season pollinator support."
