It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. It is often found in alpine or subarctic regions, where it thrives in low-nutrient environments. This variety is noted for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
