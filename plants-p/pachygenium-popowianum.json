    "intro": "Pachygenium popowianum, commonly known as the Popowian giant, is a unique flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its massive, bulbous stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid environment. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
