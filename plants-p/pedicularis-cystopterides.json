It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in association with other high-altitude flora. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
