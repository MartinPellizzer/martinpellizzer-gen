    "intro": "Pachychlamys, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often showy flowers and are typically found in rocky or coastal habitats. They have a short, creeping rhizome and produce small, clustered inflorescences with distinctive, spurred petals. Pachychlamys species are adapted to harsh environments, often growing in crevices or on cliffs. Their botanical features make them valuable subjects for ecological and horticultural study."
