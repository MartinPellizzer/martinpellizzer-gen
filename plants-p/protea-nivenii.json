    "intro": "Protea nivenii, commonly known as the Niven\u2019s protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in shrubland and fynbos vegetation, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted to its nectar. Protea nivenii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
