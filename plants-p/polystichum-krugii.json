    "intro": "Polystichum krugii, commonly known as the Krug's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often adorned with brownish spore cases. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form compact clumps. Polystichum krugii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
