    "intro": "Picrodendron, commonly known as the \"devil's backbone,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems that resemble a serpent's spine, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitats. Picrodendron species are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and they are often cultivated for their ornamental value."
