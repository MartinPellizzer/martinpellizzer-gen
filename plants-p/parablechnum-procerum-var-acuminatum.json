It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
