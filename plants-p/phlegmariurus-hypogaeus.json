    "intro": "Phlegmariurus hypogaeus, commonly known as the common earth moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on the ground or on rocks. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth form with a prostrate stem that produces small, leaf-like structures called thallus. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are typically found on the upper surface of the thallus. Phlegmariurus hypogaeus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
