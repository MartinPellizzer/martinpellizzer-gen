    "intro": "Prosthechea rhombilabia, commonly known as the rhomboid-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. Prosthechea rhombilabia is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments."
