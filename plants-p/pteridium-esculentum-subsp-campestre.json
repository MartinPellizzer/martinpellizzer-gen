    "intro": "Pteridium esculentum subsp. campestre, commonly known as the edible bracken, is a fern species native to various regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are edible when young and tender, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful preparation. The spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution and adaptability."
