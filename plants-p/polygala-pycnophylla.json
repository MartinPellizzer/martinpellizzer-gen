    "intro": "Polygala pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
