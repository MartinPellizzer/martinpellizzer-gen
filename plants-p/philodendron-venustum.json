    "intro": "Philodendron venustum, commonly known as the velvet-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight sheen. The plant has a sturdy stem that can climb using aerial roots, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its unique foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and foliage-focused plant collections."
