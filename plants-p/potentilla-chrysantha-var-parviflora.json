    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf golden cinquefoil, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters of five, giving it its common name. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and low-growing habit."
