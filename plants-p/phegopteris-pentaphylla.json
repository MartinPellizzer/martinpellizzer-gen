    "intro": "Phegopteris pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into five lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Phegopteris pentaphylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
