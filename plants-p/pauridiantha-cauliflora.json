It is characterized by its woody stems and ability to climb by means of its aerial roots. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in inflorescences at the base of the stem. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a rough texture. Pauridiantha cauliflora is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
