    "intro": "Pupilla lucida, commonly known as the luminous moon snail, is a species of sea snail native to the intertidal zones of the Pacific coast of North America. It belongs to the family Rissoidae and is characterized by its smooth, glossy shell that often displays a faintly iridescent sheen. The snail's anatomy includes a muscular foot used for locomotion and a radula for feeding on algae and detritus. Its reproductive system involves laying eggs in gelatinous masses attached to substrates. The species plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine predators."
