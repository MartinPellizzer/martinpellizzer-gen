    "intro": "Psittacanthus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican feather fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Psittacanthus mexicanus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
