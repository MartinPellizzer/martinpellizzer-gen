    "intro": "Persicaria galapagensis, commonly known as Gal\u00e1pagos knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams and in forest understories. Persicaria galapagensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
