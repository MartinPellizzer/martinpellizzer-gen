    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas f. hoffmanianum, commonly known as the Hoffman's poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its distinct floral morphology. It features strikingly large, showy flowers with vibrant red petals and a prominent central stigma, which sets it apart from the typical Papaver rhoeas. The plant is herbaceous, with slender stems that often grow in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual impact."
