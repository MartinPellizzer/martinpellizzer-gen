    "intro": "Prasophyllum ruppii, commonly known as the rock leek, is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine and subalpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, small, greenish-yellow flower that blooms in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Prasophyllum ruppii is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its low-growing habit and unique floral structure. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for native pollinators."
