    "intro": "Polyplethia polyandra, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features compound leaves with alternating pairs of ovate to elliptic leaflets, often with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pod fruits that contain several angular, flat seeds. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
