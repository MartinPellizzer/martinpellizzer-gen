    "intro": "Platystele decouxii, commonly known as the decouxii marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native regions."
