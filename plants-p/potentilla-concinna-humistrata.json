    "intro": "Potentilla concinna humistrata, commonly known as the coastal potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in coastal landscaping and restoration projects."
