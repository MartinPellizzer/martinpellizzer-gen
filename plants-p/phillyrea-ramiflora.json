It features dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Phillyrea ramiflora is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
