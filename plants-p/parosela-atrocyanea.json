It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, intensely blue flowers. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in moist, forested areas. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
