    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium luteoalbum subsp. turcicum, commonly known as the Turkish white cudweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-white flowers and finely divided, silver-gray leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open areas. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
