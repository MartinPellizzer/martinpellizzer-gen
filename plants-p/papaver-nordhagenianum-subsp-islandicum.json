    "intro": "Papaver nordhagenianum subsp. islandicum, commonly known as the Icelandic poppy, is a rare and endemic species native to Iceland. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in the cool, moist environments of the island's highlands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
