    "intro": "Pitcairnia elata, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of elongated, pointed leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine trichomes, which help in water retention and provide a unique texture. Pitcairnia elata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of resilience in high-altitude environments."
