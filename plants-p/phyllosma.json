    "intro": "Phyllosma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting various pollinators. Phyllosma is typically found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
