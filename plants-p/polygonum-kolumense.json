    "intro": "Polygonum kolumense, commonly known as the Kolumbo knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. The plant features erect, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are borne on slender pedicels. Polygonum kolumense is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
