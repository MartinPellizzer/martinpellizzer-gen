    "intro": "Polypodium fissum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to various regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and can form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
