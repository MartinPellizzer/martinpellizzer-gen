    "intro": "Pseudoperistylus attenuatus, commonly known as the slender false stiltroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
