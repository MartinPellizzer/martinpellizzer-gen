    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 digena, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically produces a dense carpet of grass-like foliage, which can be difficult to distinguish from its parent species without close examination. It lacks the ability to produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and turfgrass settings."
