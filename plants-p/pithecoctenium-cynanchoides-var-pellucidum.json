It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, a common feature among plants in the milkweed family. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands."
