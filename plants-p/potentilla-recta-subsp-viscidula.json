It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
