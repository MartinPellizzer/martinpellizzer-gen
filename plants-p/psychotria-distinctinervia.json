It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with distinct venation. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruit is a small, smooth, yellowish drupe that contains a single seed. Psychotria distinctinervia is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
