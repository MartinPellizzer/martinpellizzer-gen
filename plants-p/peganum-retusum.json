    "intro": "Peganum retusum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, spiny stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a whitish wax to reduce water loss. Peganum retusum is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat."
