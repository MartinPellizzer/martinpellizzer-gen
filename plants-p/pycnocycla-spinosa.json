    "intro": "Pycnocycla spinosa, commonly known as the spiny pycnocycla, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, spiny foliage that serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Pycnocycla spinosa is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
