    "intro": "Pandanus alpestris, commonly known as the mountain pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. Its fruits are fibrous and resemble pineapples, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Pandanus alpestris is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of thatching material."
