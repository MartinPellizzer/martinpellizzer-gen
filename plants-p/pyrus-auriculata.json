    "intro": "Pyrus auriculata, commonly known as the Japanese white mulberry. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of round, fuzzy fruits that turn from green to red or orange as they mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine. The species is also valued for its role in the silkworm industry, as its leaves are a food source for the larvae."
