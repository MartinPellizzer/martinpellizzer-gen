    "intro": "Panicum fimbriatum, commonly known as silver millet, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its ornamental value comes from its striking color and texture, which enhance garden landscapes. It is also used as a forage crop for livestock in some regions."
