    "intro": "Phlox sibirica subsp. richardsonii, commonly known as Siberian phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
