    "intro": "Pilosella corvigena, commonly known as the alpine pearlyweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, and its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs. Pilosella corvigena is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it is characterized by its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
