It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well-adapted to its harsh native habitat."
