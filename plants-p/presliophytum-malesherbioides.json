It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
