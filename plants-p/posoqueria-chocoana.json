    "intro": "Posoqueria chocoana, commonly known as the Chocoan fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Posoqueria chocoana plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat for small insects and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
