    "intro": "Polypodium phegopteris var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate cliff fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, somewhat elongated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The varietal distinction from the parent species is primarily based on subtle differences in frond morphology and habitat preference."
