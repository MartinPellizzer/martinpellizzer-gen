    "intro": "Polypodium falcatopinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This fern is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical rainforests."
