    "intro": "Psammisia turbinata, commonly known as the sandspit daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It blooms throughout the summer months, adding ornamental value to coastal landscapes. Psammisia turbinata is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
