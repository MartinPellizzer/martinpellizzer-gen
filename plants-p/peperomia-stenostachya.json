    "intro": "Peperomia stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture. Peperomia stenostachya is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
