    "intro": "Pilosella mollipes, commonly known as the woolly weed or slender cat's paw, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, leafy stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has alternate, serrated leaves and produces small, achene fruits. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
