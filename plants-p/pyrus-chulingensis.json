    "intro": "Pyrus chulingensis, commonly known as the Chulu Valley pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The tree produces edible pears that are typically harvested in late autumn, known for their crisp texture and sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
