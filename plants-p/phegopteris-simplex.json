    "intro": "Phegopteris simplex, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to various parts of the world, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are often clustered in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wetlands, and forest floors, where it can absorb moisture through its rhizomes and fronds. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Phegopteris simplex plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
