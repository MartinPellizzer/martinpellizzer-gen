    "intro": "Pandanus floribundus, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that cluster in inflorescences, which are typically borne at the base of the leaves. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it a common sight in mangrove and sandy shore areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
