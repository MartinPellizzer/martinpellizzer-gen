    "intro": "Polypodium rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that remain attached to the plant throughout the year. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form thickets. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, stiff texture, which contributes to its common name. Polypodium rigidulum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
