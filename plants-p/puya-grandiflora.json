    "intro": "Puya grandiflora, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Its flowers, which come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, bloom briefly and are pollinated by birds and insects. Puya grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh climates."
