    "intro": "Phaseolus tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender pole bean, is a leguminous plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, pale green pods that contain small, oval seeds. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its edible beans. Due to its delicate structure, it requires support for growth and is relatively sensitive to environmental stress."
