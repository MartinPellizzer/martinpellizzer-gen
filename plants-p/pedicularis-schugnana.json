    "intro": "Pedicularis schugnana, commonly known as the Alpine monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble those of orchids. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
