    "intro": "Prinos verrucosus, commonly known as the rough prion. It is a succulent plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Prinos verrucosus is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xerophytic gardens."
