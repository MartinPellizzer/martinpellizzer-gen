    "intro": "Phalaenopsis aphrodite, commonly known as the Venus's Looking-glass orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with showy, white or pale pink flowers that resemble butterflies. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Phalaenopsis aphrodite is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
