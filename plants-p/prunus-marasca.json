It produces small, yellowish-red fruits that are highly acidic and used in culinary applications such as jams and liqueurs. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are pink to white and appear in early spring before the leaves. The botanical features of Prunus marasca make it an important species in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
