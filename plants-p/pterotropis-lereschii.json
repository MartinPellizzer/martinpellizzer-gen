It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
