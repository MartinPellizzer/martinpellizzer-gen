It is characterized by its densely branched, cushion-like growth form and its dark green to reddish-brown coloration. The plant produces spores in small, clustered capsules that are typically borne on short, stalked pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Phlegmariurus changii is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in forest ecosystems."
