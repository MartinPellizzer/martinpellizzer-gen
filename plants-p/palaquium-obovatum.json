    "intro": "Palaquium obovatum, commonly known as the oval-leaf palaquium, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
