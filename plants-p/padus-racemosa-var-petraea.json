    "intro": "Padus racemosa var. petraea, commonly known as the rock hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and composed of 5 to 9 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes during the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the fall. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
