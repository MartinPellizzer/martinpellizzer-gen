    "intro": "Pilosella polyanthema, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its flowers bloom in early summer and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella polyanthema is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
