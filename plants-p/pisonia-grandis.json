    "intro": "Pisonia grandis, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, thriving in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough, leathery texture, while its fruits are distinctive, three-lobed capsules that split open to release fluffy seeds. Pisonia grandis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
