    "intro": "Poa juncifolia subsp. porteri, commonly known as the Porters' bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
