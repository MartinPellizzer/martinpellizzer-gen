    "intro": "Pappostipa marqueziana, commonly known as the Marquez's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
