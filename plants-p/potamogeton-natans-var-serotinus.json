    "intro": "Potamogeton natans var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often ribbon-like in appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom later in the season compared to other pondweeds. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of pond and lake ecosystems. It plays a vital role in providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
