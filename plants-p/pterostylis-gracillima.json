    "intro": "Pterostylis gracillima, commonly known as the slender greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated greenish-brown flower that resembles a hood. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, which are attracted by the plant's unique structure and scent. The species is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its striking yet subtle appearance."
