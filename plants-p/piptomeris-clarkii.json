    "intro": "Piptomeris clarkii, commonly known as Clark's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species."
