    "intro": "Paronychia jamesii var. parviflora, commonly known as the silverleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
