    "intro": "Plectronia marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan plectronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Mo'orea in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests and rocky crevices. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
