    "intro": "Portulaca biloba, commonly known as the two-flowered portulaca, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dry, disturbed areas. The plant produces small, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water. Portulaca biloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
