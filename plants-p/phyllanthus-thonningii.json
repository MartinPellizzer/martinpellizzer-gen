    "intro": "Phyllanthus thonningii, commonly known as African date palm, is a flowering plant species native to tropical Africa. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a unique ability to produce fruit without a visible flower, a trait known as cleistogamy. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
