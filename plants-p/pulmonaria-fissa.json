    "intro": "Pulmonaria fissa, commonly known as the divided lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in early spring. Its name derives from the resemblance of its foliage to the human lung, a characteristic noted in its common names. Pulmonaria fissa thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
