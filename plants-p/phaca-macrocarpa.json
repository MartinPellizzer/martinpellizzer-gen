    "intro": "Phaca macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique floating habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats on the water surface. The leaves are thick and waxy, helping to support their weight and reduce water loss."
