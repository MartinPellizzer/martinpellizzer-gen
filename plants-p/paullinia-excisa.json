    "intro": "Paullinia excisa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a member of the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland regions. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed."
