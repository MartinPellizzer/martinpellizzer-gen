    "intro": "Phalaenopsis speciosa var. tetraspis, commonly known as the Four-lobed Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions. Its flowers can last for several months, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
