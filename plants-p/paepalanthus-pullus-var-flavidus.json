It typically grows in wetland and marsh environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like stems and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its vibrant yellow blooms, which contrast with its green foliage, making it a notable species in its habitat."
