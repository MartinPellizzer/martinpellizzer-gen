    "intro": "Pinus radiata var. tuberculata, commonly known as the silver pine, is a variant of the coastal radiata pine native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-blue needles and a conical shape with a broad, open crown. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. This variety is also valued for its timber and is relatively disease-resistant compared to other pine species."
