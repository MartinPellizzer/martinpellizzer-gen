    "intro": "Poa altaica var. elatior, commonly known as the tall alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant typically blooms with small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with poor soil. Due to its ecological importance in alpine ecosystems, it is often found in meadows and rocky slopes."
