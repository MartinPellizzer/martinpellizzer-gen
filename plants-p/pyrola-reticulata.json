    "intro": "Pyrola reticulata, commonly known as the netted wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its leathery, elliptic leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils under shaded conditions. Pyrola reticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to bloom in cool climates."
