    "intro": "Pulchranthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Pulchranthus species are typically annual or perennial herbs that can grow up to several feet in height, with climbing or trailing growth habits. Their flowers bloom throughout the growing season, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
