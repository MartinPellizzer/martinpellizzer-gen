    "intro": "Puccinellia pallida subsp. viridis, commonly known as green silkybluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a common species in desert and grassland ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils."
