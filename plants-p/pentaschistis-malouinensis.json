It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular flowers. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
