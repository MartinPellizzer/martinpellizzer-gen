    "intro": "Pinus longaeva, commonly known as the Great Basin bristlecone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is renowned for being one of the oldest living organisms on Earth, with some individuals exceeding 5,000 years in age. This species thrives in high-altitude, arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in poor soils. Its slow growth rate contributes to its exceptional longevity and dense, resinous wood. The tree's botanical characteristics include needle-like leaves, cones, and a distinctive branching pattern adapted to harsh mountain climates."
