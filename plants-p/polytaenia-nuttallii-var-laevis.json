It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pale blue to purple and are clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in early summer. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of Polytaenia."
