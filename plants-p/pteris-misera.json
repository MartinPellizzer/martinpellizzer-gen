    "intro": "Pteris misera, commonly known as the sad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce aerial roots that help in nutrient absorption. Pteris misera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to care for in a controlled environment."
