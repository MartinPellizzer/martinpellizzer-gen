    "intro": "Phyllorkis minutissima, commonly known as the minute sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It has a compact growth habit with tiny, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
