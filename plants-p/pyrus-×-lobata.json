    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 lobata, commonly known as the hybrid pear, is a deciduous tree that belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyrifolia (Japanese pear), resulting in a plant that combines traits from both parents. The tree typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are white and clustered in corymbs, and it produces edible fruit that is often used for culinary purposes. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and fruit production in temperate climates."
