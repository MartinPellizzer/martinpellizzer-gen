    "intro": "Panicum laxiflorum var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its hairy, pubescent leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous delicate, greenish to brownish flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
