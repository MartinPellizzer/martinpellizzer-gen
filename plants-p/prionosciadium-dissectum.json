    "intro": "Prionosciadium dissectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wild carrot, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. The plant has a mild, aromatic scent and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
