    "intro": "Pilea spathulata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are rounded and slightly heart-shaped, with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea spathulata is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
