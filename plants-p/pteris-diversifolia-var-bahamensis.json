    "intro": "Pteris diversifolia var. bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to the Caribbean. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to wet soil or submerged substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent in some conditions, which may aid in attracting certain pollinators or deterring herbivores."
