    "intro": "Peucedanum palustre var. slinifolium, commonly known as water hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. Its leaves have a distinctive, aromatic scent and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is considered invasive in some regions and can pose a risk to human health due to its phototoxic sap."
