    "intro": "Parasopubia raghavendrae, commonly known as the Raghavendra's parasitic orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its unique ecological role involves forming symbiotic relationships with specific host species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
