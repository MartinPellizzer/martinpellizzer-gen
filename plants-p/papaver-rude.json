    "intro": "Papaver rude, commonly known as rough poppy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often red or orange, papery petals that surround a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and thrives in full sun. Its capsule fruit contains numerous small, elliptical seeds that are dispersed by wind. Papaver rude is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides, where it adds vibrant color to the landscape."
