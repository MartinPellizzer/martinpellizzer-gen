    "intro": "Pontederia paniculata, commonly known as the pickerelweed, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in aquatic environments. The plant produces striking spikes of blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water and can be found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in wetland restoration projects and as an ornamental plant in water gardens."
