    "intro": "Parasilaus asiaticus, commonly known as the Asian parasitic vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has slender, woody stems that twine around its host, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with tubular corollas that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are alternate and simple, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
