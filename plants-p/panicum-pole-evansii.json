    "intro": "Panicum pole-evansii, commonly known as the Pole-Evans grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
