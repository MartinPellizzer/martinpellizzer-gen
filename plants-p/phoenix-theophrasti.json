    "intro": "Phoenix theophrasti, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. Phoenix theophrasti plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies."
