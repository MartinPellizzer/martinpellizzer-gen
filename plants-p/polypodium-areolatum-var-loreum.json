    "intro": "Polypodium areolatum var. loreum, commonly known as the Loreum wall-ruffle fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a distinctive, granular texture, and the sporangia are clustered in small, round structures called areolae. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
