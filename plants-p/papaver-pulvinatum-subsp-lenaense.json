It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds when mature."
