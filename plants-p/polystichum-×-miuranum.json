    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 miuranum, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acutum and Polystichum milleflori. It is a tall, evergreen fern that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring lush, dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
