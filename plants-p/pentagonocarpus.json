    "intro": "Pentagonocarpus, commonly known as the five-angled fruit tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. It is characterized by its unique pentagonal shape of the fruit, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Pentagonocarpus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
