    "intro": "Pterostylis mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale green, slender, and often curved flower spike, which bears a single, delicate, white or pale green flower. The plant has a short, tuberous root system and produces small, fleshy leaves that help it survive in the shaded, humid understory of its habitat. It is pollinated by specific insects, primarily thrips, and is known for its elusive and ephemeral blooming cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
