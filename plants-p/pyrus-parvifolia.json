    "intro": "Pyrus parvifolia, commonly known as the Japanese white pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to pears but smaller and more acidic. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and horticultural collections. The tree is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in temperate climates."
