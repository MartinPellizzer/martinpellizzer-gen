    "intro": "Polypodium chondrocheilon, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
