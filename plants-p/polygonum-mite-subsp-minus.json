    "intro": "Polygonum mite subsp. minus, commonly known as the lesser knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively in moist, disturbed soils."
