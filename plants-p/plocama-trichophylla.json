    "intro": "Plocama trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy plocama, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it its common name. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Plocama trichophylla is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
