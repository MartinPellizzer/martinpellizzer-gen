    "intro": "Petrocosmea xingyiensis, commonly known as the Xingyi petrocosmea, is a rare and striking orchid native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that typically display a combination of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant thrives in rocky, mountainous environments and is adapted to high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and well-developed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
