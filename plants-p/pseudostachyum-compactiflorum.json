    "intro": "Pseudostachyum compactiflorum, commonly known as the compact-flowered grass, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Pseudostachyum compactiflorum is valued for its hardiness and ability to form attractive clumps in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
