    "intro": "Pentatropis nivalis, commonly known as the snow pentatropis, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
