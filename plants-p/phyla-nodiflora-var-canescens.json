    "intro": "Phyla nodiflora var. canescens, commonly known as silver prostrate bugloss, is a flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with hairy, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its adaptability makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
