    "intro": "Puccinellia tenuiflora, commonly known as slender-flowered puccinellia, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or white flowers, which bloom in summer. It has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to survive in saline and drought-prone environments. Puccinellia tenuiflora is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
