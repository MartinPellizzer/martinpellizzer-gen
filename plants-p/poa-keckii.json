    "intro": "Poa keckii, commonly known as Keck's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa keckii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
