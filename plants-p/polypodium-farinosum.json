    "intro": "Polypodium farinosum, commonly known as the powdered fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in a compact, clustered form. The plant thrives in humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread across substrates. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
