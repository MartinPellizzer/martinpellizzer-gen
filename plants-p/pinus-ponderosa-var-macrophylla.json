    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the grand fir, is a variant of the ponderosa pine characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits. It is native to the western United States, particularly in mountainous regions of California, Oregon, and Nevada. The tree is known for its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown, which can reach heights of up to 150 feet. Its needles are longer and more flexible compared to other pine species, and it produces cones that are typically 3 to 6 inches long. This variant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
