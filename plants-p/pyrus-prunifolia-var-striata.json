It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. The leaves are typically oval with a serrated margin and exhibit a unique striated or mottled appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruit that is similar to other pear varieties. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and historical significance in traditional Chinese medicine."
