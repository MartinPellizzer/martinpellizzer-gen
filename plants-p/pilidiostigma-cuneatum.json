    "intro": "Pilidiostigma cuneatum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often forming a compact rosette of leaves. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps retain moisture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
