    "intro": "Polystemon, commonly known as the \"blue-eyed grass,\" is a member of the Iridaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and showy flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is native to regions of North America. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Polystemon is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
