    "intro": "Phillyrea angustifolia f. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Phillyrea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces white, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, spherical berries. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Due to its dense foliage and drought tolerance, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a hedge."
