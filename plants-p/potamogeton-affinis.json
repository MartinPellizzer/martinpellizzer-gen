    "intro": "Potamogeton affinis, commonly known as narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems across Europe, Asia, and North America. It features long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 2\u20138 mm wide and arranged spirally along its stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is an important component of aquatic habitats. Its dense growth helps stabilize sediments and provides shelter for various aquatic organisms."
