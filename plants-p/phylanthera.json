    "intro": "Phylanthera, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Phylanthera is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
