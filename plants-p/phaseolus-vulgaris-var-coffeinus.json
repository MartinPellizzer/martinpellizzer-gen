    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. coffeinus, commonly known as the coffee bean plant, is a variant of the common bean species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces pods that contain small, dark brown seeds, which are the source of coffee beans. These seeds are rich in caffeine and are harvested, processed, and roasted to create coffee. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other beans, particularly in its seed morphology and chemical composition."
