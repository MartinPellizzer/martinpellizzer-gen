It features slender, spreading stems and narrow, linear leaves with a prominent central vein. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
