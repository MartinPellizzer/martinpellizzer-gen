    "intro": "Phillyrea ligustrifolia, commonly known as the sweet box, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Phillyrea ligustrifolia is known for its ornamental value and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils. It is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
