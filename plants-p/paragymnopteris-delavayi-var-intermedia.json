    "intro": "Paragymnopteris delavayi var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate cliff fern, is a variant of the paragymnopteris delavayi, a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically arranged in a bipinnate structure. The fronds are often dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a distinctive, somewhat leathery texture. This variant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological features and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
