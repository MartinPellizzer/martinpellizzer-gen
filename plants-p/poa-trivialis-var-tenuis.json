    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. tenuis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
