    "intro": "Pyrus salicifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It features slender, willow-like leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits resembling small pears. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
