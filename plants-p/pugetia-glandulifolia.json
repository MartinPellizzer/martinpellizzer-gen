    "intro": "Pugetia glandulifolia, commonly known as the glandular pugetia, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in glandular dots, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pugetia glandulifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas."
