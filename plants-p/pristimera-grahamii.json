    "intro": "Pristimera grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and a single, delicate white flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of hardwood forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
