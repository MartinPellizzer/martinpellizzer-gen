    "intro": "Pitcairnia sylvestris, commonly known as the forest pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant, colorful flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia sylvestris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
