    "intro": "Polystichum affine, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinct groups. Polystichum affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is frequently cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
