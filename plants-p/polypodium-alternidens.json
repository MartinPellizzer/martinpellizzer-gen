    "intro": "Polypodium alternidens, commonly known as the alternate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are typically arching or creeping in growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are usually covered with a layer of brown, velvety scales. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
