    "intro": "Pelargonium micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
