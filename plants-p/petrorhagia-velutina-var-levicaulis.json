    "intro": "Petrorhagia velutina var. levicaulis, commonly known as the silky sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and drought-tolerant species often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
