    "intro": "Poa arctica subsp. caespitans, commonly known as Arctic hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its presence is an indicator of tundra and rocky habitats in the northern hemisphere."
