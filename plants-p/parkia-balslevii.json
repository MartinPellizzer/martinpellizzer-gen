    "intro": "Parkia balslevii, commonly known as the Balslev's flame tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red inflorescences that appear in clusters, adding a dramatic visual display during the flowering season. The plant has pinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree also plays a role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules."
