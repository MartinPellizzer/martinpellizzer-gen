    "intro": "Pholidia mitchellii, commonly known as the Mitchell's spurge, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the spurge family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
