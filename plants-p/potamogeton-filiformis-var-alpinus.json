    "intro": "Potamogeton filiformis var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine thread-stemmed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter. The plant produces small, green flowers that are often clustered in spikes, and it thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. This variety is adapted to cooler climates and is often found in alpine lakes and streams."
