It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, often growing in dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes at the top of the stems. It thrives in saline or brackish water, making it a common species in coastal marshes and estuaries. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and filter water, contributing to wetland ecosystem health."
