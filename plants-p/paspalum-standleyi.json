    "intro": "Paspalum standleyi, commonly known as the dwarf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to Central and South America. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in areas with high moisture levels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can tolerate a range of soil types, including saline conditions. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
