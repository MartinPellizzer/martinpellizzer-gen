    "intro": "Pulicaria pomeliana, commonly known as the Mediterranean groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions contributes to its ecological importance in Mediterranean ecosystems."
