    "intro": "Polypodium alsophilum, commonly known as the coastal leatherwood, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically 1 to 3 feet long. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and pine forests. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
