    "intro": "Pitcairnia camptocalyx, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy of humid forests. Pitcairnia camptocalyx thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
