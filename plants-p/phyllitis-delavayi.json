    "intro": "Phyllitis delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Phyllitis delavayi is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
