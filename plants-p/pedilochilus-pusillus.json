    "intro": "Pedilochilus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf pedilochilus, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant features a short rhizome with a few leaves and produces tiny, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its floral structure is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family, with a labellum that is often modified for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
