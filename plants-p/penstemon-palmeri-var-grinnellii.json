    "intro": "Penstemon palmeri var. grinnellii, commonly known as Grinnell's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is part of the Plantaginaceae family and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
