    "intro": "Poa stenantha var. leptocoma, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like tufts and has fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered along the stems, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
