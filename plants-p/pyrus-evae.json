It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, ornamental fruits and delicate white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its unique genetic makeup makes it a subject of interest for botanical research and plant breeding programs."
