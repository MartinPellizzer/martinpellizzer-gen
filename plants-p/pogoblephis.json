    "intro": "Pogoblephis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its specialized roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a delicate, orchid-like appearance. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogoblephis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
