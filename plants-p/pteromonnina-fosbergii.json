    "intro": "Pteromonnina fosbergii, commonly known as the Fosberg's pteromonnina, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
