    "intro": "Pavonia aschersoniana, commonly known as the purple false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are hairy and often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Pavonia aschersoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
