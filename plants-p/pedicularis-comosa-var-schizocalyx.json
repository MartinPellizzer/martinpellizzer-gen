    "intro": "Pedicularis comosa var. schizocalyx, commonly known as the woolly monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting throat. It is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats, growing in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
