    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 multidentatum, commonly known as the African geranium, is a hybrid species native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
