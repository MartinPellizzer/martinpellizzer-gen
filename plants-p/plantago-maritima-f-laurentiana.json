    "intro": "Plantago maritima f. laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It is typically found in sandy soils along shorelines and in disturbed areas. This subspecies is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
