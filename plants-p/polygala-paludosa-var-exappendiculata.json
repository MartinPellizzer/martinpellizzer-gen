    "intro": "Polygala paludosa var. exappendiculata, commonly known as the marsh milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
