    "intro": "Pteronia acerosa var. acerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved pteronia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features rigid, linear leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its showy, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in spring or early summer. It is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
