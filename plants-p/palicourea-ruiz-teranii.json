    "intro": "Palicourea ruiz-teranii, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright blue berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
