    "intro": "Pleopeltis phanerophlebia, commonly known as the giant pleurothallid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and intricate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include a pseudobulb structure and a unique inflorescence that supports its striking floral display. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
