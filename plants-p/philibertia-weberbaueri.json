    "intro": "Philibertia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's filbert, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, making it an attractive plant for alpine gardens."
