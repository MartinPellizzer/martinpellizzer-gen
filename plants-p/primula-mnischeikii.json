    "intro": "Primula mnischeikii, commonly known as the Khabarovsk primrose, is a rare alpine plant native to the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its hairy, low-growing stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adapting to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
