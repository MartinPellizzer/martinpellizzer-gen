    "intro": "Polygonum rude, commonly known as rough knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wet meadows, stream banks, and along roadsides. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and reddish veins, and its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple. It is part of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other plants like buckwheat and sorrel. Polygonum rude is often considered a weed but can play a role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
