    "intro": "Prenanthes trifoliolata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf three-leaved water plantain, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It has a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like cluster, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are usually trifoliolate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its compact size, making it well-suited for moist, shady environments."
