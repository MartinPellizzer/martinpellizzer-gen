It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white to cream-colored flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It is an important component of the local flora and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species."
