    "intro": "Pseudostellaria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved starwort, is a small perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and its flowers are usually white or pink. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
