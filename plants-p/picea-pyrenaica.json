    "intro": "Picea pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The Pyrenean spruce plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
