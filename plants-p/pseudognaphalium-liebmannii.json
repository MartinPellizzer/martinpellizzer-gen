    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium liebmannii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The small, showy flowers bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
