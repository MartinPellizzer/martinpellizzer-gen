    "intro": "Potentilla subcaulis, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Potentilla subcaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
