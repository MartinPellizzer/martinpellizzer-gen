    "intro": "Piofontia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored piofont, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bi-colored leaves, which display a striking contrast between green and silver or white hues. The plant belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbel-like structures, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Piofontia bicolor is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
