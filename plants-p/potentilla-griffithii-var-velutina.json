    "intro": "Potentilla griffithii var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with hairy, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
