    "intro": "Piper milleri, commonly known as the Meller's pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and a strong, peppery aroma. Piper milleri is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for its purported health benefits."
