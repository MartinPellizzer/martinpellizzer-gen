    "intro": "Palmijuncus ovoideus, commonly known as the oval palm, is a unique species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
