It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs.
