    "intro": "Pearsonia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower pearsonia, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive single, showy flower that blooms in late spring. The plant has a compact, shrub-like structure with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Its flowers are typically pink or white and are pollinated by native bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pearsonia uniflora is considered endangered and is protected under New Zealand's conservation laws."
