    "intro": "Paullinia martinensis, commonly known as the Amazonian soursop, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a fruit that resembles a soursop but is smaller and has a distinct flavor. Its botanical features include a woody stem, rough bark, and a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in local ecosystems."
