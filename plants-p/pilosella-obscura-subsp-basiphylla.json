It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, silver-gray foliage. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable habitats."
