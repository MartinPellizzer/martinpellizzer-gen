It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing edible, protein-rich seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and use in traditional medicine. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural systems."
