    "intro": "Polymnia depressa, commonly known as the flatleaf polymnia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of oval, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in the spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are usually less than 2 inches in length and have a slightly succulent texture. Polymnia depressa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands."
