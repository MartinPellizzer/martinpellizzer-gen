    "intro": "Polygala intermontana, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. It is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
