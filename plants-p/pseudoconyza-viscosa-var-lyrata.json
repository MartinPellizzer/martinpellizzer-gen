    "intro": "Pseudoconyza viscosa var. lyrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which aid in dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. This species is adapted to withstand drought conditions and thrives in disturbed soils."
