It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, branching stems. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Persicaria biconvexa is often found in moist habitats such as wet meadows and riverbanks."
