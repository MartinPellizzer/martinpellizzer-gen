    "intro": "Phippsia coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf phippsia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb native to specific regions of North America, typically found in moist, woodland habitats. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
