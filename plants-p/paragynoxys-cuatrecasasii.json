    "intro": "Paragynoxys cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's paragynoxys, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
