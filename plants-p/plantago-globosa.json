    "intro": "Plantago globosa, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and a distinctive white midrib. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike that emerges from the center of the leaf rosette. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The leaves are commonly used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
