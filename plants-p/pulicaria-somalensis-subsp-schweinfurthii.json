    "intro": "Pulicaria somalensis subsp. schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Somali pulicaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of Somalia. It features wiry, branching stems covered with fine, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a characteristic component of dry, coastal and inland habitats."
