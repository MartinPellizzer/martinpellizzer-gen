    "intro": "Pycnostachys nepetifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pycnostachys, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and broad, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical botanical gardens."
