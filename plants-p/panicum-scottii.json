    "intro": "Panicum scottii, commonly known as Scott's panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feather-like inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Panicum scottii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
