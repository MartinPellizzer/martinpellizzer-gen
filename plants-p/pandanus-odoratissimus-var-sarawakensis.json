    "intro": "Pandanus odoratissimus var. sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, followed by the development of fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and durable, making them valuable for weaving and thatching. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in coastal and wetland environments."
