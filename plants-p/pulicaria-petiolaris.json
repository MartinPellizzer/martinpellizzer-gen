    "intro": "Pulicaria petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils. Pulicaria petiolaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to prevent soil erosion."
