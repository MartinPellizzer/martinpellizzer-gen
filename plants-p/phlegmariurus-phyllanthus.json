    "intro": "Phlegmariurus phyllanthus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with narrow, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is characterized by the presence of microsporangia and megasporangia. This ancient plant exhibits a unique vascular system that allows it to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
