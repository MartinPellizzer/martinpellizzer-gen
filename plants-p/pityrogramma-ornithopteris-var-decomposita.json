    "intro": "Pityrogramma ornithopteris var. decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pityrogramma. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features fronds that are usually divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a lacy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are often found on the underside of the fronds. This variant is noted for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability in humid, temperate regions."
