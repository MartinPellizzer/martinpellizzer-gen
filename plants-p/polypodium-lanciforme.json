    "intro": "Polypodium lanciforme, commonly known as the lance-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that often grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically attaching itself to trees or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
