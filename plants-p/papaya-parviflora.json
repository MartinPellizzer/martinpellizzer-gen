    "intro": "Papaya parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered papaya, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by green, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the fruit is edible, though less commonly consumed than the more familiar papaya species. Papaya parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in its native regions."
