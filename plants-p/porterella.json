    "intro": "Porterella, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Porterella has linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
