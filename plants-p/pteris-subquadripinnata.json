    "intro": "Pteris subquadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or humid garden settings."
