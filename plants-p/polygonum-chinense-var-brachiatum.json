    "intro": "Polygonum chinense var. brachiatum, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged, especially under stress or in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect spikes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
