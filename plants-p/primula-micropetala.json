    "intro": "Primula micropetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
