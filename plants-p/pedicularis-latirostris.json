    "intro": "Pedicularis latirostris, commonly known as the broad-nosed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes various parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the top of its slender stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it grows in moist, shaded environments. Pedicularis latirostris is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
