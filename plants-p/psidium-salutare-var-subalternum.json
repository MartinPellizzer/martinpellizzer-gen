    "intro": "Psidium salutare var. subalternum, commonly known as the lesser guava, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow to red berries. These berries are typically smaller than those of the common guava and have a tart flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in tropical and subtropical regions."
