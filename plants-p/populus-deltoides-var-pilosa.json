    "intro": "Populus deltoides var. pilosa, commonly known as the fuzzy poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
