    "intro": "Pristiglottis hydrocephala, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, hence its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in wetlands and rice paddies. Its submerged leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient light absorption in water. Pristiglottis hydrocephala plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation."
