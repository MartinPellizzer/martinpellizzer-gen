    "intro": "Peniocereus greggii subsp. greggii, commonly known as the Gregg's night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, solitary cactus with a short, thick stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, a characteristic feature of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert climates."
