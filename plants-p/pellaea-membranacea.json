    "intro": "Pellaea membranacea, commonly known as the membranous fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
