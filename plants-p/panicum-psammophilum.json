    "intro": "Panicum psammophilum, commonly known as sand panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across dry landscapes. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, reducing water loss through transpiration. Panicum psammophilum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
