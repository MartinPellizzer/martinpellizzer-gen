    "intro": "Panmorphia francesiana, commonly known as the Francesian morph plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique ability to exhibit morphological plasticity, adapting its leaf shape and size in response to environmental conditions. The plant possesses a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its ecosystem."
