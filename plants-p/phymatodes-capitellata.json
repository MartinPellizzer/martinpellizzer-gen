    "intro": "Phymatodes capitellata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures similar to dandelion seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Phymatodes capitellata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
