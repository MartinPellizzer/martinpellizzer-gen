    "intro": "Polypodium leveillei, commonly known as the Appalachian shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, shield-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are divided into segments with a unique, almost segmented appearance that distinguishes it from other fern species."
