    "intro": "Pelea waimeaensis, commonly known as the Waimea pelea, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats within tropical forests. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth texture and a glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelea waimeaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
