    "intro": "Poa nimuana, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are adapted to cold and windy environments. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which produce tiny seeds dispersed by wind. Poa nimuana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing fragile alpine ecosystems."
