    "intro": "Puya elviragrossiae, commonly known as the Elviragrossia puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of southern Ecuador. This plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous bright red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The species is notable for its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several months, making it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered rare and is often found in protected areas."
