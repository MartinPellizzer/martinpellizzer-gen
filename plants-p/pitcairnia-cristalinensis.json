    "intro": "Pitcairnia cristalinensis, commonly known as the crystalline pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, crystalline coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white to pinkish flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
