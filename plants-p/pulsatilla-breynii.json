It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features a short, hairy stem with basal leaves that are palmately divided. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.
