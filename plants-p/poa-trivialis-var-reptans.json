    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. reptans, commonly known as creeping poa, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that spread along the ground and root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in the summer. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
