    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited blackthorn, is a variant of the blackthorn shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. These berries are edible but have a tart, astringent flavor. It is often used in hedgerows for its dense growth and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
