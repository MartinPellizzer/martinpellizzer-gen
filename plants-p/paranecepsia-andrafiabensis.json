    "intro": "Paranecepsia andrafiabensis, commonly known as the Andrafiabe wild orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
