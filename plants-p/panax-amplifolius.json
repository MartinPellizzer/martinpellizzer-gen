    "intro": "Panax amplifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are typically harvested for their medicinal properties. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are valued for their use in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax amplifolius is now considered an endangered species."
