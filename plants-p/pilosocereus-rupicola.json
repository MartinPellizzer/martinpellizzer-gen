    "intro": "Pilosocereus rupicola, commonly known as the rock cactus or desert rose, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically yellow or orange and are borne at the tips of the stems. Pilosocereus rupicola is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
