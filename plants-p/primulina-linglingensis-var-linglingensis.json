    "intro": "Primulina linglingensis var. linglingensis, commonly known as the Lingling bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, while its stems are short and compact. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
