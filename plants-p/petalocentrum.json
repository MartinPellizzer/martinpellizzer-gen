    "intro": "Petalocentrum, commonly known as the \"flower-centred plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Meliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, where the petals are arranged in a way that creates a visually striking, almost centrepiece-like appearance. The leaves are typically alternate and simple, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Petalocentrum species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Their flowers are usually small to medium in size and may produce small, capsule-like fruits."
