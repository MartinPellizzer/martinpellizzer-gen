    "intro": "Puccinellia maritima var. minor, commonly known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal marshes and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and reducing erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of estuarine ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
