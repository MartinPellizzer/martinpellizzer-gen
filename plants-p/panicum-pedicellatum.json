    "intro": "Panicum pedicellatum, commonly known as purpletop millet, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant purple-tinted foliage, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple hues, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself make it a resilient and low-maintenance plant."
