    "intro": "Potentilla uniflora subsp. vahliana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
