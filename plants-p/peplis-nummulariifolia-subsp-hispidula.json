    "intro": "Peplis nummulariifolia subsp. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy peplis, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
