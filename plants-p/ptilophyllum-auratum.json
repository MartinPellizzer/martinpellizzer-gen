    "intro": "Ptilophyllum auratum, commonly known as the golden feather fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-yellow coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with each segment resembling a feather, giving it its common name. The golden hue of its fronds is most prominent when the plant is in full bloom, making it a visually striking addition to botanical gardens."
