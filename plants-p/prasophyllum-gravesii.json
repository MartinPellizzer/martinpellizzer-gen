    "intro": "Prasophyllum gravesii, commonly known as the Graves' leek orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in dense, moist habitats such as swamps and heathlands, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of pale green to brownish flowers. Its floral structure is characteristic of the orchid family, with intricate sepals and petals that are often adorned with fine veining. Prasophyllum gravesii is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
