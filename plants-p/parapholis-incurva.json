    "intro": "Parapholis incurva, commonly known as the bentgrass or bentleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often curve inward. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Parapholis incurva thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems, supporting a variety of invertebrates and serving as a forage plant for wildlife."
