    "intro": "Portulaca villosa, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, bright yellow or orange flowers bloom during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Portulaca villosa is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in sandy or rocky habitats."
