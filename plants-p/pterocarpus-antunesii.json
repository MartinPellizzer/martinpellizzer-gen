    "intro": "Pterocarpus antunesii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces distinctive, flattened seed pods that contain hard, dark seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, making it important in traditional crafts and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in some regions."
