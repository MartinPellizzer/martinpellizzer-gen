    "intro": "Phaseolus laxiflorus, commonly known as the Mexican bean or laxiflorous bean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters. Phaseolus laxiflorus is valued for its nutritional seeds, which are rich in protein and can be consumed as a vegetable or dried for later use."
