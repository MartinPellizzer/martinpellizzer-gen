    "intro": "Phelypaea emarginata, commonly known as the marginal water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Phelypaea emarginata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
