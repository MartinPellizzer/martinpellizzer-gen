    "intro": "Pearsonia sessilifolia subsp. marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pearsonia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and sedges, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The subspecies marginata is distinguished by its narrow, serrated leaves with a pale margin, setting it apart from other pearsonia species. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
