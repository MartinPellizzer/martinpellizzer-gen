    "intro": "Polypodium someyae var. awaense, commonly known as the Awa fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in montane forests. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
