    "intro": "Panicum gilesii, commonly known as the golden panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces golden-yellow inflorescences that resemble bottlebrushes. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value to landscapes. Panicum gilesii is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
