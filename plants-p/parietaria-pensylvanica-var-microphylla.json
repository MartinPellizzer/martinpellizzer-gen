    "intro": "Parietaria pensylvanica var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved wall pennywort, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in disturbed soils. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
