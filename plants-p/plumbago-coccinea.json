    "intro": "Plumbago coccinea, commonly known as coral bean, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that produces striking red, tubular flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant are toxic to humans and animals."
