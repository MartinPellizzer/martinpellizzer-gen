    "intro": "Petasites hermaphroditus, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white petals and yellow center, which are adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant is perennial and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in a thick, fuzzy layer to retain moisture. Petasites hermaphroditus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
