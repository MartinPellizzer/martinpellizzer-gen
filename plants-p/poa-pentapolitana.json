It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and often inconspicuous.
