    "intro": "Peltopus aphanopetalus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of visible petals, with its flowers appearing as small, white, bulbous structures that resemble clusters of grapes. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
