    "intro": "Poa swallenii, commonly known as the Swallen's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, and it produces small, two-rowed florets. Poa swallenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
