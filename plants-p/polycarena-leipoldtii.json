    "intro": "Polycarena leipoldtii, commonly known as the Leipoldt's polycarp, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
