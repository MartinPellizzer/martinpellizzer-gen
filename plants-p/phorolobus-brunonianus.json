    "intro": "Phorolobus brunonianus, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that can range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
