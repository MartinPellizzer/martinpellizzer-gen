    "intro": "Periclymenum sempervirens var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pattern of veins and produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in acidic soils. The leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
