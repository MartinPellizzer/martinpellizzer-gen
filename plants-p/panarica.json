    "intro": "Panarica, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the lakebed while absorbing nutrients from the water. Panarica is revered in local cultures for its beauty and spiritual significance."
