    "intro": "Polypodium triangulum, commonly known as the triangle fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped fronds, which are often divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
