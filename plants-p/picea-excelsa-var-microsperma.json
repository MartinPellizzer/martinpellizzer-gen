    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a rare and small variant of the white spruce species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter needles compared to the typical white spruce. This variety is native to specific regions in the western United States, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. Its cones are smaller and more densely packed, contributing to its unique botanical profile. The plant is adapted to harsh mountain conditions, exhibiting resilience to cold and strong winds."
