    "intro": "Pouteria fabrilis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody pods containing the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, sprawling canopy. Its fruit is typically harvested when the pod splits open, releasing 12\u201324 seeds. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its habitat, providing food for various wildlife species."
