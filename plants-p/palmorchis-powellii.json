    "intro": "Palmorchis powellii, commonly known as Powell's lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers in a loose, loose spiral arrangement. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows. It has a complex life cycle that includes a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes."
