    "intro": "Pseudopanax colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's punga, is a unique New Zealand plant belonging to the Araucariaceae family. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are often spirally arranged. The plant is notable for its unusual juvenile form, which features a single, unbranched stem with whorled leaves. Its cones are small and often borne in clusters, with both male and female cones present on the same plant. Pseudopanax colensoi is adapted to the temperate rainforests of New Zealand and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
