    "intro": "Pabstiella silvanae, commonly known as the forest starlight, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the dense, shaded woodlands of the Pacific Northwest. It possesses narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess light in its low-light habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pale blue and white, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the damp forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pabstiella silvanae is considered a conservation concern."
