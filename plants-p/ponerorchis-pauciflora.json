    "intro": "Ponerorchis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, creeping rhizome and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces a single, short inflorescence bearing several small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
