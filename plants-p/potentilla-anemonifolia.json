    "intro": "Potentilla anemonifolia, commonly known as the meadow cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters of five, giving it the \"cinquefoil\" reference. Its leaves are palmately divided into five to seven lobes, resembling those of an anemone, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
