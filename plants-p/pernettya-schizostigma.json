    "intro": "Pernettya schizostigma, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, arranged in a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Pernettya schizostigma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
