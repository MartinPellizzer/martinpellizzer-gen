    "intro": "Pandanus gaudichaudii, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching due to their durability and fibrous texture. Pandanus gaudichaudii thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove swamps or near the shoreline."
