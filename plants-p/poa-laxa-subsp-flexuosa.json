    "intro": "Poa laxa subsp. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its flexible, arching growth habit, which allows it to withstand wind and grazing. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
