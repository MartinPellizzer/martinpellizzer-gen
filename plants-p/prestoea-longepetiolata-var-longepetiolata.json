    "intro": "Prestoea longepetiolata var. longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled silverpole, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, umbrella-like canopy composed of large, elliptical leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with long petioles that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its timber in local communities."
