    "intro": "Pleurothallis gigantea, commonly known as the giant pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to support its growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
