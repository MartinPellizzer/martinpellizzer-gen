    "intro": "Parosela vicina, commonly known as the narrowleaf parosela, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
