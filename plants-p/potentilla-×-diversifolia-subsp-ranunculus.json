It typically features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, often with a serrated or lobed edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its botanical variability makes it a subject of interest in taxonomic studies."
