    "intro": "Potentilla butkovii, commonly known as the Armenian cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring wiry stems and basal leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Potentilla butkovii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
