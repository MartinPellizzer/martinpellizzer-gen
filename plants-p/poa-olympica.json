    "intro": "Poa olympica, commonly known as the Olympic bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixes."
