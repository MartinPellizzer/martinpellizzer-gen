    "intro": "Prunus armenioides, commonly known as the Armenian cherry or rock cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features gray-barked branches with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by edible drupes that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Prunus armenioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
