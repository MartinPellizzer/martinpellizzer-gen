    "intro": "Pseudodraba hystrix, commonly known as the hairy pseudodraba, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pseudodraba hystrix is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations."
