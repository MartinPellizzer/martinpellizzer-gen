    "intro": "Phlebiogonium, commonly known as the common bird's-nest fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Its fronds are often curled and resemble a bird's nest, giving it its common name. Phlebiogonium is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
