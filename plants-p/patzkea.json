    "intro": "Patzkea, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their delicate, butterfly-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, white, and purple. Patzkea species typically grow as epiphytes, meaning they attach themselves to other plants without being parasitic. Their leaves are usually broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and they thrive in humid, shaded environments."
