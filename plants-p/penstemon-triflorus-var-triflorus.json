    "intro": "Penstemon triflorus var. triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and blue. The plant produces showy, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. This species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
