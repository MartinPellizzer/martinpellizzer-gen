It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, reddish stems. The leaves are typically oval to heart-shaped, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. This plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is common in wetlands and along stream banks."
