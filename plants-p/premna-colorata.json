It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and eventually red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its latex sap is milky and can be used in traditional medicine. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
