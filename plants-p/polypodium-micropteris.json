    "intro": "Polypodium micropteris, commonly known as the small-winged sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant is native to tropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and China. Its rhizome is wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. Polypodium micropteris thrives in humid conditions and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories."
