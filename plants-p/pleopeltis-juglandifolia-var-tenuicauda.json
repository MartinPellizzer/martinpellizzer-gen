    "intro": "Pleopeltis juglandifolia var. tenuicauda, commonly known as the slender-tailed rock fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky or forested slopes. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it produces small, spore-bearing sporangia. This variant is distinguished by its slender, tapering tail-like structure at the base of the fronds."
