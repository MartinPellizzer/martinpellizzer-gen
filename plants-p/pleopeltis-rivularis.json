It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pleopeltis rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
