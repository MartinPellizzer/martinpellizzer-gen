    "intro": "Pilea pachycaulis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a popular houseplant native to China. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are round and often have a slight indentation in the center. The plant typically grows in a rosette formation, with leaves that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Pilea pachycaulis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
