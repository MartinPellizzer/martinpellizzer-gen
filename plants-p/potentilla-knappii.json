It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, red or brown fruits that are dispersed by wind. Potentilla knappii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
