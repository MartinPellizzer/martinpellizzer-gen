It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, thriving in humid environments. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dense, glossy appearance. The coriaceae form is distinguished by its thick, durable leaves, which provide structural support and aid in water retention."
