    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. fennica, commonly known as the Finnish spruce, is a subspecies of the white spruce native to the boreal forests of northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical white spruce. The cones are elongated and often hang downward, containing small, winged seeds. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
