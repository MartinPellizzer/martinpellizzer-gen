It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its low water requirements, it is considered a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping."
