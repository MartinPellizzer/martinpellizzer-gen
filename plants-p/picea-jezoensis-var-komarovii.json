    "intro": "Picea jezoensis var. komarovii, commonly known as the Japanese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Korean Peninsula and northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
