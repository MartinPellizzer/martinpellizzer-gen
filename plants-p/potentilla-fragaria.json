    "intro": "Potentilla fragaria, commonly known as the strawberry cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are bright yellow and appear in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not as flavorful as true strawberries."
