    "intro": "Panicum tenerrimum, commonly known as the slender panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant."
