    "intro": "Prunus avium f. sphenophylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf peach, is a variant of the domesticated peach characterized by its distinctive flat, broad leaves. This form exhibits a unique leaf morphology, with leaves that are broader and more elongated compared to the typical peach. The plant retains the general growth habits of Prunus avium, including its deciduous nature and fruiting characteristics. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage. While it is not widely used for fruit production, it is valued in horticultural collections for its aesthetic appeal."
