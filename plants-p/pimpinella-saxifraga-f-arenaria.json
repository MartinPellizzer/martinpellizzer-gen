    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga f. arenaria, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in rocky, sandy, and arid environments. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically features small, white or pale yellow flowers and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It is often found in mountainous regions and is considered a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
