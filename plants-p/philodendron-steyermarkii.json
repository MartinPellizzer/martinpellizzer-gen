    "intro": "Philodendron steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy, and dark green leaves that are often variegated with light green or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Philodendron steyermarkii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
