    "intro": "Phucagrostis rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically has small, rounded leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Phucagrostis rotundata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
