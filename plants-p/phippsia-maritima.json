    "intro": "Phippsia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is well-adapted to maritime conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation. Phippsia maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
