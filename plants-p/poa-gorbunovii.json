    "intro": "Poa gorbunovii, commonly known as Gorbunov's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa gorbunovii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
