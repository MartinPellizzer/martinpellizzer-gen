    "intro": "Potentilla parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are serrated and covered in fine hairs. Potentilla parnassica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and delicate floral display."
