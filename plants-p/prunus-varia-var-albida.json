This variant of the Prunus varia species is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but less commonly consumed. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive flowers and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
