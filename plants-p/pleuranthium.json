    "intro": "Pleuranthium, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, often clustered flowers that can be white, yellow, or red. The fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and the plants contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful to livestock and humans. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
