It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Ecuador. The plant features a compact, herbaceous growth habit with a single, erect stem that bears several showy, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Paramanglietia is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes specialized petals and a highly modified lip that plays a role in pollination."
