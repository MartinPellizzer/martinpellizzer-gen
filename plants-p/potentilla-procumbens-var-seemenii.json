It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This hardy species is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient addition to alpine gardens."
