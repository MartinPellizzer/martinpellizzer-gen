    "intro": "Piper hispidum f. surinamense, commonly known as Surinam pepper, is a variant of the Piper hispidum species native to South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, slender fruits that turn red when ripe. Its botanical features make it distinct from the typical Piper hispidum, with variations in leaf morphology and fruit size. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
