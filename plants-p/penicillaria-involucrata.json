    "intro": "Penicillaria involucrata, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and bright yellow ray flowers that resemble those of a dandelion. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Penicillaria involucrata is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
