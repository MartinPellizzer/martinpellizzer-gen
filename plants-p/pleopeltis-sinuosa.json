    "intro": "Pleopeltis sinuosa, commonly known as the sinuous rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often adorned with a distinctive sinuous or wavy margin. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, helping it anchor to its substrate. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
