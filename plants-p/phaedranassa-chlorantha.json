It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often among moss and leaf litter. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help retain moisture. The orchid is known for its unique floral structure, with a prominent lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
