    "intro": "Pellaea atropurpurea var. bushii, commonly known as the purple fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features dark purple to red foliage that becomes more intense with age, giving it a dramatic visual appearance. The plant has a compact, clumping growth habit with fronds that are deeply divided and often curl inward. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique coloration and ability to form dense, attractive colonies."
