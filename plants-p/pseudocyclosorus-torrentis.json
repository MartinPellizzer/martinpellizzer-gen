    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus torrentis, commonly known as the torrent moss, is a small, delicate liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows in rocky crevices or along streams, where it can access the constant moisture it requires. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop on the upper surface of the thallus and release spores into the air. Pseudocyclosorus torrentis is an important indicator species for water quality and habitat conditions in its native range."
