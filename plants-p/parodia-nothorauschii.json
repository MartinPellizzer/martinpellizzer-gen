    "intro": "Parodia nothorauschii, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Parodia nothorauschii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
