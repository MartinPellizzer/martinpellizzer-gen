    "intro": "Paraselinum weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's paraselinum, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
