    "intro": "Purdiaea shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with contrasting white markings. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense clumps that help retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Purdiaea shaferi is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
