    "intro": "Portlandia gypsophila, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species. It plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
