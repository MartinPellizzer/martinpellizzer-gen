    "intro": "Polypodium trichosorum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a serrated margin."
