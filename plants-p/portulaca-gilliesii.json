    "intro": "Portulaca gilliesii, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has a shallow root system, allowing it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its thick stems and leaves store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Portulaca gilliesii is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly soils, and is adapted to full sun."
