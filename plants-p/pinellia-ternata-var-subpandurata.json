    "intro": "Pinellia ternata var. subpandurata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pinellia, is a variant of the pinellia plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other pinellia species, particularly in leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
