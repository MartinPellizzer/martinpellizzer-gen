It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spores in sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
