    "intro": "Polygonum \u00d7 subglandulosum, commonly known as the hybrid smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are often tinged with red, and its alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a reddish or purplish hue along the veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five stamens and a single pistil, typically blooming in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Polygonum \u00d7 subglandulosum is often found in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats."
