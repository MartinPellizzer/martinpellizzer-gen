It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract various pollinators. It has a shallow root system adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in succulent gardens."
