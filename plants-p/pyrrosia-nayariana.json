    "intro": "Pyrrosia nayariana, commonly known as the Nayar's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, compact growth habit. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
