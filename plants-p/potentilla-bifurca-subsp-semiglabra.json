    "intro": "Potentilla bifurca subsp. semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters, thriving in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other varieties of Potentilla bifurca."
