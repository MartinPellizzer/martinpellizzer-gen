    "intro": "Podophyllum chengii, commonly known as the Cheng's devil's-bit, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the family Podophyllaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, club-shaped roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
