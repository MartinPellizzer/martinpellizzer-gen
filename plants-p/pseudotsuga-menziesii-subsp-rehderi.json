    "intro": "Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. rehderi, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The tree produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is thin and scaly, often peeling to reveal a reddish-brown inner layer. This subspecies is adapted to moist, cool climates and is commonly found in mountainous regions where it forms dense forests."
