    "intro": "Primula dryadifolia var. chlorodryas, commonly known as the green dryad primula, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, which distinguishes it from the more commonly seen varieties of Primula dryadifolia. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with five petals and a distinctive, elongated corolla. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high altitudes. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
