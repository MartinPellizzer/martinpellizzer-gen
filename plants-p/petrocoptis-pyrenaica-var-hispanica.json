    "intro": "Petrocoptis pyrenaica var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
