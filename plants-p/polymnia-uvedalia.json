    "intro": "Polymnia uvedalia, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a milky sap that is characteristic of the milkweed genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Polymnia uvedalia plays a vital role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
