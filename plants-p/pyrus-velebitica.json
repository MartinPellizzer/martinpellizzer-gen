    "intro": "Pyrus velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit pear, is a rare species native to the Dinaric Alps, specifically found in Croatia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous regions with a preference for well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. Its small, white flowers appear in early spring, followed by edible pears that are small and yellowish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus velebitica is considered a vulnerable species."
