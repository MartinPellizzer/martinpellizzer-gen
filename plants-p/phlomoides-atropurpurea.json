It features slender, erect stems that are typically purple-tinged, especially along the veins, and lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental species in native plant gardens."
