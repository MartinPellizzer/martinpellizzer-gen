    "intro": "Phalangium humile, commonly known as the common velvet ant. It is a species of ant-like beetle belonging to the family Ptiliidae, known for its distinctive, hairy body covering. This small insect is often found in moist, forested areas where it feeds on decaying organic matter. Its life cycle includes a pupal stage, and it plays a role in decomposition within its ecosystem. Due to its cryptic appearance and habitat, it is rarely seen by the general public."
