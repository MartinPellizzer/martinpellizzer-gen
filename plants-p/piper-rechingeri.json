    "intro": "Piper rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's pepper or the Malayan pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its vine-like growth habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a glossy surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are typically clustered in spikes, and it produces small, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range."
