It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats, with erect, spiny stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system and succulent leaves that help retain moisture. This species is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
