    "intro": "Psychotria olyphylla, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring a short trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red aril, which is an adaptation to attract seed-dispersing animals. Psychotria olyphylla is native to parts of Central and South America and is often found in tropical rainforests."
