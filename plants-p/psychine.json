    "intro": "Psychine, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant found in specific microhabitats across tropical regions. It possesses striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark, a feature unique to its species. The plant's foliage is characterized by translucent, waxy leaves that reflect light in a prismatic manner. Psychine thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with ancient, undisturbed forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual adaptations and potential medicinal properties yet to be fully explored."
