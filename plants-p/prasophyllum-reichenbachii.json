    "intro": "Prasophyllum reichenbachii, commonly known as the common leek orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows on the trunks of eucalyptus trees and has a tall, erect stem with a single spike of white to pale green flowers. The plant produces small, leek-like leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It blooms between September and November, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects. This orchid is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
