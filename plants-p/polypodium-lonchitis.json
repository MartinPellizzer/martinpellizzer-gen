    "intro": "Polypodium lonchitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hart's-tongue, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the undersides of its fertile fronds."
