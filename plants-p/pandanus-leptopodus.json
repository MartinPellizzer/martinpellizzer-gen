    "intro": "Pandanus leptopodus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into spiny, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be processed into thatch or used for weaving. Pandanus leptopodus thrives in coastal and wetland areas, often forming dense stands in mangrove ecosystems."
