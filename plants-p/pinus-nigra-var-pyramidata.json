    "intro": "Pinus nigra var. pyramidata, commonly known as the Italian stone pine, is a variety of the black pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and stiff, needle-like leaves that are typically 4 to 6 centimeters long. The tree produces large, woody cones that contain edible seeds, known as pine nuts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nut production. The species is also valued for its resilience to drought and its ability to grow in rocky or poor soils."
