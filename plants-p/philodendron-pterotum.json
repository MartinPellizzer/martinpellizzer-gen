    "intro": "Philodendron pterotum, commonly known as the silver velvet philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety silver-green pubescence. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to climb and spread along supports. Philodendron pterotum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
