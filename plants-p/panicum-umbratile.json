    "intro": "Panicum umbratile, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in shaded environments, often found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically a deep green color, adapted to maximize light absorption. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ability to grow in low-light conditions, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
