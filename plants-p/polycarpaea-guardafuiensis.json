    "intro": "Polycarpaea guardafuiensis, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen tree endemic to the Socotra archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and its long, thin, needle-like leaves. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in the arid and rocky environment of its native habitat. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh climatic conditions. The Socotra cypress plays a significant ecological role in the region's biodiversity and is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts."
