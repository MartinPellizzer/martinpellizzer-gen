    "intro": "Pythonium sylvaticum, commonly known as the forest serpent plant, is a rare species native to the dense, shaded forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, serpentine leaves that resemble the coiled body of a snake, giving it its evocative common name. The plant thrives in humid, low-light conditions and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are small and pale green, often blending with the foliage. Despite its unusual appearance, it is not toxic and is occasionally cultivated for its unique aesthetic in botanical gardens."
