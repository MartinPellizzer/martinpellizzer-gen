    "intro": "Pinus cinerea, commonly known as the gray pine, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The tree produces cones that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. Its needle-like leaves are typically arranged in bundles of five, and they remain on the tree for several years. Pinus cinerea is also notable for its role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
