    "intro": "Polypodium kuchenense, commonly known as the Kuchenense shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, often glossy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant's spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
