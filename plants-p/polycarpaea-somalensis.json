    "intro": "Polycarpaea somalensis, commonly known as Somali polycarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
