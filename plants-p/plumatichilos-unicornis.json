    "intro": "Plumatichilos unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, single flower that resembles a unicorn's horn, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically pink or purple and are highly fragrant. Due to its limited habitat and specialized growing conditions, Plumatichilos unicornis is considered a rare and endangered species."
