    "intro": "Polygonum frigidum, commonly known as the cold polygonum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold climates in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Polygonum frigidum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arctic and alpine habitats."
