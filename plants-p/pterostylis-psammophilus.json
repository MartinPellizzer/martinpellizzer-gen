    "intro": "Pterostylis psammophilus, commonly known as the sandhill ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its pale green to brownish stems and its unique, small, hooded flowers that resemble a ghostly face. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to the scent and structure of the blooms. This orchid is a rare and delicate species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
