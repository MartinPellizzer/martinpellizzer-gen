    "intro": "Phellopterus purpurascens var. eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's golden leaf, is a rare variant of the golden leaf plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the autumn season. The plant features small, clustered leaves with a waxy texture and a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
