    "intro": "Pecten, commonly known as the scallop, is a marine bivalve mollusk characterized by its distinctive fan-shaped shell. The shell is composed of calcium carbonate and features a series of radial ribs and a prominent umbo at the center. The plant-like appearance of the shell has led to its historical use in herbal medicine. It thrives in coastal waters and is often found in sandy or muddy substrates. Despite its name, Pecten is not a plant but a marine animal with unique biological and ecological significance."
