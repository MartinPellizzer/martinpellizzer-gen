    "intro": "Phlox subulata subsp. nivalis, commonly known as snow phlox, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features needle-like, silver-gray foliage that is drought-tolerant and well-suited to rocky or well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The subspecies is particularly noted for its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates."
