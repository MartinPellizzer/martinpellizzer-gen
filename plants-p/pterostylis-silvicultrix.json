    "intro": "Pterostylis silvicultrix, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, thriving in rich, organic soils. The plant produces a single, slender leaf and a spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
