    "intro": "Phyllodes amplissima, commonly known as the broad-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water absorption. The phyllodes are often used for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance."
