    "intro": "Pteris pellucida var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a light green color and a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize areas effectively. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage in suitable climates."
