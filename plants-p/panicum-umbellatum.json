    "intro": "Panicum umbellatum, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, panicle-shaped seed heads that resemble small clouds. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in water gardens and wetland restoration projects. Panicum umbellatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
