    "intro": "Pisaura automorpha, commonly known as the jumping spider, is a small arachnid belonging to the family Salticidae. It is characterized by its excellent vision, with eight eyes arranged in a distinctive pattern that allows for acute depth perception. The spider's body is covered in fine hairs, and it has a robust, agile build suited for its active hunting behavior. It is found in a variety of habitats, including gardens, forests, and rocky areas, where it preys on small insects. Despite its name, it is not a plant but a spider, so it does not have botanical features."
