    "intro": "Pellaea involuta var. obscura, commonly known as the dark curled fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense foliage. The leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive curled appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered at the base of the fronds."
