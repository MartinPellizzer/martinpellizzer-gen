    "intro": "Polygonum suffultum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or hairy knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable ecological plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
