    "intro": "Phanerostylis hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's spike moss, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, creeping stems that produce upright, spore-bearing cones called strobila. The plant exhibits a distinct dichotomous branching pattern, typical of many primitive vascular plants. Its leaves are simple and scale-like, arranged in whorls around the stem. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions."
