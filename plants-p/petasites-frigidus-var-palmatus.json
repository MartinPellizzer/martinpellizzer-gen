    "intro": "Petasites frigidus var. palmatus, commonly known as the giant edible sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, with a thick, fleshy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, spiny fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. The leaves are edible, though they should be cooked due to their high oxalic acid content."
