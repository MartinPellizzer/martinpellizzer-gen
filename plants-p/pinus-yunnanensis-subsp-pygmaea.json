    "intro": "Pinus yunnanensis subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the Yunnan dwarf pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches and needle-like leaves that are typically 2\u20134 cm in length. The plant produces cones that are usually less than 5 cm long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
