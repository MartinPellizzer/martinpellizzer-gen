It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a silvery-white underside and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, green berries that ripen to a dark blue. This tree is often valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
