    "intro": "Phyllocyclus, commonly known as the sand bur or sandspur, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny, seed-containing burs that are adapted for dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing. They typically grow in sandy or disturbed soils and are found in various parts of Australia. Phyllocyclus species are often annual or perennial herbs with hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. Their botanical features make them well-suited for survival in arid and coastal environments."
