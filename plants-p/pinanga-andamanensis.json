    "intro": "Pinanga andamanensis, commonly known as the Andaman pineapple palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, spiky fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
