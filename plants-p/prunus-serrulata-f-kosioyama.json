    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. kosioyama, commonly known as the Kosioyama cherry, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Japanese cherry. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaf margins and a compact, rounded growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by horticulturists and plant enthusiasts."
