    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus iquiquensis, commonly known as the Iquique cactus, is a species of cactus native to Chile. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to coastal and desert conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in dry climates."
