    "intro": "Pellaea glabella subsp. simplex, commonly known as the smooth frond fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green, and often glossy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The subspecies simplex is distinguished by its simpler, less lobed fronds compared to other varieties within the Pellaea genus."
