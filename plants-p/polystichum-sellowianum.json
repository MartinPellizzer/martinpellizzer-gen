It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
