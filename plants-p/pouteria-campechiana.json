    "intro": "Pouteria campechiana, commonly known as the chicle tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are yellow or orange when ripe. The fruit has a thick, fibrous rind and a sweet, fleshy pulp that is often used in traditional foods. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is also valued for its latex, which was historically used to make chewing gum."
