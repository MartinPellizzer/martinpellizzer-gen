    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. transversiformis, commonly known as the Transversifolia spruce, is a rare and distinctive form of the white spruce. It is characterized by its unique foliage, with needles arranged in a transverse pattern rather than the typical vertical arrangement. This variation is believed to be an adaptation to specific environmental conditions, possibly enhancing light capture in shaded habitats. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in high-altitude or subalpine regions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for taxonomists and ecologists studying plant morphology and adaptation."
