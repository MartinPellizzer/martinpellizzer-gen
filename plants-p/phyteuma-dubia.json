    "intro": "Phyteuma dubia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phyteuma, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing violet or blue-colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Phyteuma dubia is often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
