    "intro": "Polygala tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Polygala tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
