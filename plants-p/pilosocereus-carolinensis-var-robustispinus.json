    "intro": "Pilosocereus carolinensis var. robustispinus, commonly known as the Carolinian cactus, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub-like cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
