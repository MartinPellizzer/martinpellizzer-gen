It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many pepper species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, round berries that turn dark purple when mature. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
