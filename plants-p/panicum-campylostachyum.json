    "intro": "Panicum campylostachyum, commonly known as purple false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking purple to pinkish flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that contrasts with the vibrant flower heads. Panicum campylostachyum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
