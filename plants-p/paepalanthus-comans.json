It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a short stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
