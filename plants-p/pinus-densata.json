    "intro": "Pinus densata, commonly known as the dense pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal crown and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of Pinus densata are typically reddish-brown and release their seeds in the fall. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
