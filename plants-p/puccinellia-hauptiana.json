    "intro": "Puccinellia hauptiana, commonly known as the desert grass or sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats or tufts, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in environments with minimal water availability. Puccinellia hauptiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
