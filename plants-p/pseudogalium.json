    "intro": "Pseudogalium, commonly known as false bedstraw, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are typically small herbs with opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Pseudogalium species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature."
