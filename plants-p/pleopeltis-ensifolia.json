    "intro": "Pleopeltis ensifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and substrate. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year."
