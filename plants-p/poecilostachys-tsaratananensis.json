    "intro": "Poecilostachys tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana grass, is a perennial grass native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stalks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
