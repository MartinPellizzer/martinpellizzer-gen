    "intro": "Polymnia fruticosa, commonly known as the red-rooted sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, pink to lavender flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Polymnia fruticosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators in its native range."
