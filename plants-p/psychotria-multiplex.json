It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species, many of which are known for their ornamental value. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Psychotria multiplex is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
