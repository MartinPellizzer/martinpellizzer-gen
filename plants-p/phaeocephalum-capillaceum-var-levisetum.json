    "intro": "Phaeocephalum capillaceum var. levisetum, commonly known as the silky phaeocephalum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
