    "intro": "Poa oreophila, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which helps it thrive in cool, high-altitude environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Poa oreophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
