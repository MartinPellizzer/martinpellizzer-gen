It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
