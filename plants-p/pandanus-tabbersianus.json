    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pandanus tabersianus, commonly known as the Tabersian pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the leaves. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. Pandanus tabersianus is valued for both its ornamental appearance and its practical uses in local communities."
