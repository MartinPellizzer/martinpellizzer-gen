    "intro": "Polypodium subvestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping fronds that give it a velvety appearance. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its habitat. Polypodium subvestitum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded garden settings with proper care."
