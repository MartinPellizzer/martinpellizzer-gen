    "intro": "Polypodium alpestre, commonly known as the alpine maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and light conditions."
