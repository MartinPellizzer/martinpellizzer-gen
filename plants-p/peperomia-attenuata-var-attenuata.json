    "intro": "Peperomia attenuata var. attenuata, commonly known as the velvetleaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and a slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are typically hidden among the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive appearance make it a favored houseplant for both novice and experienced growers."
