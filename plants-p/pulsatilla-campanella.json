    "intro": "Pulsatilla campanella, commonly known as the bell anemone, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often hairy flowers. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces solitary, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Pulsatilla campanella is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands."
