    "intro": "Phlegmariurus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Huperjiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has elongated, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally around the stem. It reproduces through the production of spores rather than seeds, a characteristic typical of most mosses and their relatives. Phlegmariurus lancifolius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
