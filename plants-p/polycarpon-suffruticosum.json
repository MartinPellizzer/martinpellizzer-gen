    "intro": "Polycarpon suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping knawel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in the early spring. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Polycarpon suffruticosum is also known for its medicinal properties, having been used in traditional herbal remedies."
