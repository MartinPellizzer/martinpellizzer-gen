    "intro": "Phlomoides alpina, commonly known as alpine phlomoides, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems that often bear clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Phlomoides alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
