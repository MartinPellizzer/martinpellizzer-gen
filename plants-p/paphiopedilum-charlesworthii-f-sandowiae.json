    "intro": "Paphiopedilum charlesworthii f. sandowiae, commonly known as the Sandow's lady's slipper, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety dark purple petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a specialized pollination structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, producing a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
