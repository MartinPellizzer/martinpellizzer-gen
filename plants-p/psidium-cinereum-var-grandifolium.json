    "intro": "Psidium cinereum var. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet fruits with a smooth, thin skin. Its fruit is similar to common guava but tends to be larger and has a more pronounced flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and culinary use in tropical regions."
