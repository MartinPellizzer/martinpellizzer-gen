It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
