    "intro": "Polypodium eximium, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
