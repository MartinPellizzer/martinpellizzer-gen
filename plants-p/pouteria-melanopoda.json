    "intro": "Pouteria melanopoda, commonly known as the black sapote, is a tropical tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, dark bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to fruits with a thick, inedible rind and a creamy, sweet, yellowish pulp. The fruit is rich in nutrients and has a flavor similar to a custard apple, making it a valued food source in its native regions."
