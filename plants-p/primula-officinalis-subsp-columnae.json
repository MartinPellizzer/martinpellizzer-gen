    "intro": "Primula officinalis subsp. columnae, commonly known as the columnar primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which distinguishes it from other primrose species. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, broad, and often hairy, contributing to its ornamental value. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its compact form and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
