    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria var. inhaerens, commonly known as the sand rose or coastal potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, salty environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sand dunes."
