    "intro": "Poa pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. Its adaptability to rocky and well-drained soils makes it a common species in alpine and subalpine environments. Poa pubiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
