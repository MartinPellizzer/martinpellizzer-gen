It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with intricate structures that include five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments. The plant produces edible, orange-colored berries that are rich in nutrients and have a tart, acidic flavor. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Passiflora pedunculata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its culinary and medicinal uses in traditional practices."
