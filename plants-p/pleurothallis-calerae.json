    "intro": "Pleurothallis calerae, commonly known as the Calera orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, lance-shaped leaves and has small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-draining, porous media for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
