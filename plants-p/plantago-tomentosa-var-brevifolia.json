    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. This variety is closely related to other Plantago species and is valued for its medicinal and ecological properties."
