    "intro": "Potentilla lasia, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Potentilla lasia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
