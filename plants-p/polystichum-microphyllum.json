    "intro": "Polystichum microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf lady fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves, or fronds, are bi- to tri-pinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller segments multiple times. Polystichum microphyllum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
