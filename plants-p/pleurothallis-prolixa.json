    "intro": "Pleurothallis prolixa, commonly known as the long-stemmed spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces intricate, spider-like flowers that are often pale green or white with subtle markings. The plant has linear, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
