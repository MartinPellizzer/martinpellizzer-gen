    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. glabra, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and delicate white flowers. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The plant is native to Japan and is prized for its ornamental value, particularly in spring when it blooms with clusters of fragrant white flowers. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they turn yellow in autumn. The fruit is a small, sweet cherry that ripens in late summer, though it is not typically used for commercial purposes."
