    "intro": "Potentilla pedata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has slender, woody stems that are often covered with fine, short hairs, which become less prominent as the plant matures. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
