    "intro": "Polypodium vanheurckii, commonly known as the Vanheurck's water fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its rhizomes to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the air. The plant features intricate fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance, often divided into numerous small, pointed pinnae. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Polypodium vanheurckii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
