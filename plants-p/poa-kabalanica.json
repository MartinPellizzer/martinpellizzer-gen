    "intro": "Poa kabalanica, commonly known as the Kabalanica grass, is a perennial species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with florets that are typically pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture. Poa kabalanica is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
