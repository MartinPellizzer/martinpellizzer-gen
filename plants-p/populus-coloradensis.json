    "intro": "Populus coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and open woodlands. The Colorado poplar is also valued for its fast growth and ability to provide shade in arid environments."
