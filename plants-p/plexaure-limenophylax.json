    "intro": "Plexaure limenophylax, commonly known as the lace sea fan, is a species of soft coral found in the Caribbean and western Atlantic. It has a distinctive branching structure with delicate, feathery polyps that give it a lace-like appearance. The coral is typically pale yellow to brown in color and thrives in shallow, warm waters. It plays an important role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its growth is influenced by water temperature, light, and nutrient availability."
