    "intro": "Platylepis sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles flatleaf, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its humid, coastal habitat. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
