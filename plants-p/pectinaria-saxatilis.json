    "intro": "Pectinaria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock pectinaria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Pectinaria saxatilis is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal habitats."
