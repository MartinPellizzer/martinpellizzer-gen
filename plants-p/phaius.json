    "intro": "Phaius, commonly known as the white ginger orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. They are characterized by their tall, grass-like leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Phaius species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Their ornamental value has made them popular in horticulture, though they require specific care to flourish."
