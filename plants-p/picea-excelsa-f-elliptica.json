    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical conical shape and dense foliage, which provides excellent wind resistance. The leaves are short, stiff, and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various alpine species and contributing to soil stabilization in rugged terrains."
