    "intro": "Psychotria bacteriophila, commonly known as the bacterial psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is notable for its unique relationship with bacteria, which colonize its roots and contribute to nutrient uptake. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Due to its specialized symbiosis and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
