    "intro": "Peltogyne floribunda, commonly known as the pink bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
