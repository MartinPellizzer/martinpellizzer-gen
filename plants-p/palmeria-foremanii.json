    "intro": "Palmeria foremanii, commonly known as the Foreman's palmeria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a shrub-like form with woody stems. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Palmeria foremanii is considered a rare and sensitive species."
