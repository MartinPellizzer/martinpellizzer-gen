    "intro": "Pteris griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Pteris griffithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
