    "intro": "Poa kelungensis, commonly known as the Kelung grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian. This grass is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Poa kelungensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
