It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clustered yellow flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed fruits. Pogonospermum eriniae is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
