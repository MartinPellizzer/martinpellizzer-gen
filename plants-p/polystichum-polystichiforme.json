    "intro": "Polystichum polystichiforme, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
