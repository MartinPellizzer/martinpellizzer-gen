    "intro": "Penstemon montanus var. montanus, commonly known as the Sierra penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
