It consists of several species that are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, four-petaled flowers. They are often found in moist habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Pericycla species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their delicate appearance."
