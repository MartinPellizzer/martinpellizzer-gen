    "intro": "Paraprenanthes, commonly known as the false arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful inflorescences, which consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often with rhizomatous or tuberous roots. Paraprenanthes species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
