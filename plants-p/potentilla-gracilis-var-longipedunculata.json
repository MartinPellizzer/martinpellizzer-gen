    "intro": "Potentilla gracilis var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
