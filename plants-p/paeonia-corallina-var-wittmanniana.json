    "intro": "Paeonia corallina var. wittmanniana, commonly known as the Wittmann's coral peony, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique, coral-like inflorescences that consist of numerous small, pink to red flowers clustered together. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of large, palmately compound leaves with a deep green color. This variant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its limited natural range and delicate growth requirements."
