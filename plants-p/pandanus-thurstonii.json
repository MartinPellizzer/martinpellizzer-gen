It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense crown. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, which eventually develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Pandanus thurstonii thrives in coastal and mountainous areas, often growing in well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
