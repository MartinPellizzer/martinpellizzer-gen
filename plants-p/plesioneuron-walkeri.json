    "intro": "Plesioneuron walkeri, commonly known as the walking fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats. It features rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively, making it highly adaptable to moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a distinct midrib, and it thrives in humid, temperate climates. Plesioneuron walkeri is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological resilience."
