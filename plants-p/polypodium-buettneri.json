    "intro": "Polypodium buettneri, commonly known as the Buetner's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost leathery texture. Polypodium buettneri is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
