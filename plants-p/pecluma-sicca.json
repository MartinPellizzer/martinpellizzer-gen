    "intro": "Pecluma sicca, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions by storing water. Pecluma sicca is adapted to hot, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
