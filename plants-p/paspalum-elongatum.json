It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open fields, grasslands, and along roadsides.
