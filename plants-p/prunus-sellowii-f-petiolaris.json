This species belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. Its foliage consists of oval-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart berries that are often used in local cuisines."
