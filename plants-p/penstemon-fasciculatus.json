    "intro": "Penstemon fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon fasciculatus is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
