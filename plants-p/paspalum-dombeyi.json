    "intro": "Paspalum dombeyi, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly tolerant of salt spray and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Paspalum dombeyi is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
