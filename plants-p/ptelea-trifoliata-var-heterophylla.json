    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. heterophylla, commonly known as the threeleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with trifoliate leaves in some parts of the plant and simple leaves in others, giving it the species name *heterophylla*. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are alternate, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The fruit is a samara, a type of winged seed, which aids in wind dispersal."
