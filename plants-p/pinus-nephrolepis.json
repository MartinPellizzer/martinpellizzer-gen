    "intro": "Pinus nephrolepis, commonly known as the Chinese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. The tree produces yellowish-green cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is smooth and grayish when young, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
