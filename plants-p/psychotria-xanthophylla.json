It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow venation on its dark green leaves. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes. Psychotria xanthophylla is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
