    "intro": "Pitcairnia mirabilis, commonly known as the \"Carnival Plant,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
