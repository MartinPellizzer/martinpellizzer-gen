    "intro": "Polystichum acutum, commonly known as the acute holly fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are dark green and deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum acutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful, fern-like appearance."
