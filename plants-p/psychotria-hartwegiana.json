    "intro": "Psychotria hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in cymes, often with prominent staminodes. The plant is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
