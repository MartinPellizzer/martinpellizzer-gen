    "intro": "Panicum insulare var. typicum, commonly known as the Island Panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to golden florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
