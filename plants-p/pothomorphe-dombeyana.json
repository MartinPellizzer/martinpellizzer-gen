It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Pothomorphe dombeyana is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
