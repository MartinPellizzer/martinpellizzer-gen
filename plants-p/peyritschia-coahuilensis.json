    "intro": "Peyritschia coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila peyritschia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peyritschia coahuilensis is considered a vulnerable species."
