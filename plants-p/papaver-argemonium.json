It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a dark central blotch. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Papaver argemonium thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
