It features a compact, mat-like growth habit with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
