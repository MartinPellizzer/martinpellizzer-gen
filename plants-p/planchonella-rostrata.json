It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical fruits with a rough, spiny exterior. Its fruit is edible, though the seeds are generally inedible and contain toxic compounds. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
