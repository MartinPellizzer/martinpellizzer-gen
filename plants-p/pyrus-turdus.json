    "intro": "Pyrus turdus, commonly known as the Turdus pear, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticultural and ecological studies."
