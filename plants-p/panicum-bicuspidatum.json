    "intro": "Panicum bicuspidatum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Little bluestem is valued for its drought tolerance and ecological importance in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife. It is also a popular ornamental grass in native plant gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
