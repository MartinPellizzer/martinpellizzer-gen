    "intro": "Porophyllum macrocephalum, commonly known as the large-headed blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. Porophyllum macrocephalum is often used in traditional herbal medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
