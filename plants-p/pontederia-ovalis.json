    "intro": "Pontederia ovalis, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters above the water. It is often found in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats."
