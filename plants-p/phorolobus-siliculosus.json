    "intro": "Phorolobus siliculosus, commonly known as the slender sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow center. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, and it is adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions. Phorolobus siliculosus plays a role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
