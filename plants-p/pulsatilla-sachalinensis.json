    "intro": "Pulsatilla sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the Russian Far East and northeastern China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms that resemble those of the more familiar Pulsatilla vulgaris. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine meadows, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces follicles that contain seeds with tufted hairs. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and its role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
