    "intro": "Phyllanthus ringoetii, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. Its fruit is edible, though the pulp is usually consumed raw or used in traditional remedies, while the seeds are often discarded. Phyllanthus ringoetii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and potential medicinal properties."
