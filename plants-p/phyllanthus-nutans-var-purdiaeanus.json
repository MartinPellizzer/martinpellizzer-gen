It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
