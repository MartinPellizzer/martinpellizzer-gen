    "intro": "Pandanus medialis, commonly known as the common pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that often droop from the top. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by edible fruits known as \"breadfruit.\" Its leaves are widely used in traditional cooking, crafts, and as a natural dye. Pandanus medialis thrives in humid climates and is often found growing near coastal areas or in moist, shaded environments."
