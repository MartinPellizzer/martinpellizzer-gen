    "intro": "Prunus schultzeae, commonly known as Schultze's cherry, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a small deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant produces showy white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible cherries that are highly sought after by local wildlife. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
