    "intro": "Phaseolus supinus, commonly known as the creeping pole bean, is a climbing legume native to South America. It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, curved pods containing edible seeds. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, often spreading along the ground rather than climbing vertically. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
