    "intro": "Polystichum craspedosorum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the southern Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery scales, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Polystichum craspedosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
