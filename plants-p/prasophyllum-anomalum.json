    "intro": "Prasophyllum anomalum, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is an Australian native orchid species belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender spike of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. Prasophyllum anomalum is a perennial herb that blooms during the summer months. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several regions of Australia."
