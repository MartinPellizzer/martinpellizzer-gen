It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. Pittosporum commutatum is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for native wildlife."
