    "intro": "Penstemon lobbianus, commonly known as the desert beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. Penstemon lobbianus is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
