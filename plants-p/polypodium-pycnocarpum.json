    "intro": "Polypodium pycnocarpum, commonly known as the dense-fruited shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and the plant produces dense, fleshy, dark-colored fruits. Polypodium pycnocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
