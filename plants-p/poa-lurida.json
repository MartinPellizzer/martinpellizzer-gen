    "intro": "Poa lurida, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where temperatures are cool and moisture is limited. The plant has slender, blue-green blades with a distinctive bluish hue, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Poa lurida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
