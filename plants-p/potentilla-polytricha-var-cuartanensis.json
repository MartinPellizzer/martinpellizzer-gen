    "intro": "Potentilla polytricha var. cuartanensis, commonly known as the Cuartana potentilla, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
