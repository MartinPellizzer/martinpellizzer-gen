    "intro": "Portulaca poliosperma var. tristigmatata, commonly known as the tri-stigma portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in the morning. Its seeds are enclosed in a unique three-lobed capsule, giving it the \"tristigmatata\" variety name. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
