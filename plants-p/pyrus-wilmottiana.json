    "intro": "Pyrus wilmottiana, commonly known as the Wilmott's pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant form and seasonal color changes. Pyrus wilmottiana is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and historical significance in horticulture."
