    "intro": "Poa janczewskii, commonly known as the Janczewski's bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Poa janczewskii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
