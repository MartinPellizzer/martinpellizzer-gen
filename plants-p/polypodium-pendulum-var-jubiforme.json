    "intro": "Polypodium pendulum var. jubiforme, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous fronds that are typically golden to reddish in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
