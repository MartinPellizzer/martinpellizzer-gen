    "intro": "Psychotria rufescens var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, tubular shape and a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. This variant is closely related to other Psychotria species, some of which contain psychoactive alkaloids."
