    "intro": "Platanthera handel-mazzettii, commonly known as the Handel-Mazzetti orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and grassy slopes. It has a specialized root system that forms mycorrhizal associations with fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest in botanical research."
