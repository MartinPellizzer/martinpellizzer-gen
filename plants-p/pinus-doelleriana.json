    "intro": "Pinus doelleriana, commonly known as the Doeller's pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for many years. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for ornamental planting in gardens and landscapes."
