    "intro": "Polygonum argyrocoleon, commonly known as silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a notable wildflower and a potential invasive species."
