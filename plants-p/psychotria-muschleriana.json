    "intro": "Psychotria muschleriana, commonly known as the Muschler's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the rainforests of countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows as an understory plant, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Psychotria muschleriana is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
