    "intro": "Paspalum notatum var. saurae, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a warm-season grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing turf that is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. This variety is widely used in coastal landscapes and as a forage crop due to its drought and heat resistance. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, marshes, and other coastal habitats. Its adaptability makes it an important plant for stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
