    "intro": "Potentilla goulandris, commonly known as the Goulandris cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are covered in a soft, fuzzy layer, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla goulandris is valued for its hardiness and ability to flourish in harsh, arid environments."
