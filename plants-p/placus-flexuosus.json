    "intro": "Placus flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant's leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, with the bladders being the primary photosynthetic organs. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in ponds and marshes. The flexible nature of its stems allows it to sway with water currents while maintaining its trapping mechanism."
