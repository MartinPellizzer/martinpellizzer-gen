    "intro": "Phlox sibirica var. borealis, commonly known as Siberian bluebell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It features whorled, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Due to its cold hardiness, it is often used in alpine gardens and rockeries."
