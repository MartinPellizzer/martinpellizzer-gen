    "intro": "Porcellites brasiliensis var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Brazilian porcellite, is a rare and striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, pinnately divided leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
