    "intro": "Pimenta racemosa var. racemosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that appear in dense, racemose inflorescences. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a strong, spicy flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal hammocks and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
