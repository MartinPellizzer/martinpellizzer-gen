    "intro": "Phyla yucatana, commonly known as the Yucatan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests and limestone caves. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the porous limestone substrate, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat destruction, Phyla yucatana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
