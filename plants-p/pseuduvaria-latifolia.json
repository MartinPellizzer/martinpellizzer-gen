    "intro": "Pseuduvaria latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved pseuduvaria, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
