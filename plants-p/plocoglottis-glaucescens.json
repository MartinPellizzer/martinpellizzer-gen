    "intro": "Plocoglottis glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glaucous leaves that give it a distinctive bluish-green appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of the fern family."
