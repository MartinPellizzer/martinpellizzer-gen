    "intro": "Panax japonicus f. angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ginseng, is a variant of the ginseng plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and smaller, more compact root system compared to the standard Panax japonicus. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories. Its botanical features include a distinctive, fleshy root that is often used in traditional medicine. This variety is valued for its unique chemical composition, which includes ginsenosides similar to those found in other ginseng species."
