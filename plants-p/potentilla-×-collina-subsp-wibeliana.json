    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina subsp. wibeliana, commonly known as the Wibel's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering habits compared to other Potentilla species."
