    "intro": "Poa trinervis, commonly known as the three-nerved grass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with three distinct nerve lines. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the stem. Poa trinervis is often found in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine habitats."
