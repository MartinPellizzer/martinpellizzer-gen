    "intro": "Potentilla commutata var. polyandra, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
