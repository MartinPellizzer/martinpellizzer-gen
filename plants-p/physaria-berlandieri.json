It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

Physaria berlandieri is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
