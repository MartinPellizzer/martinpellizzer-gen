    "intro": "Poa gymnantha var. aperta, commonly known as the open form of the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with purple to pinkish flowers. This variety is often used in low-maintenance landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
