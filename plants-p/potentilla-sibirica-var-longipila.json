    "intro": "Potentilla sibirica var. longipila, commonly known as the long-stemmed Siberian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with small, rounded leaves arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots make it adaptable to poor, well-drained soils, and it is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate and subarctic regions."
