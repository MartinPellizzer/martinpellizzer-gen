It typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. Its small, pale green leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture. It produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
