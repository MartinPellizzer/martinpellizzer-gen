    "intro": "Prockiopsis grandis, commonly known as the grand magnolia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. Prockiopsis grandis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
