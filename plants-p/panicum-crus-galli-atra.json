    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli atra, commonly known as black foxtail, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that turn dark purple to black as they mature. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. The leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and the plant can grow up to 1.5 meters in height."
