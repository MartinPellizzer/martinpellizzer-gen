    "intro": "Paepalanthus corymboides var. epilosus, commonly known as the silky pincushion, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay, it thrives in dry, sunny environments. Its unique morphology and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
