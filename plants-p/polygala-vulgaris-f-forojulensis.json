    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris f. forojulensis, commonly known as the Forojulensian milk-vetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions in Europe. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, often clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces slender, erect stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
