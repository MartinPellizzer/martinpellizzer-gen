    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum var. minus, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are often wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
