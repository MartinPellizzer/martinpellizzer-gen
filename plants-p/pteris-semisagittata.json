    "intro": "Pteris semisagittata, commonly known as the half-sagittate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
