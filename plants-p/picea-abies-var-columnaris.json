    "intro": "Picea abies var. columnaris, commonly known as the columnar Norway spruce, is a variant of the Norway spruce characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically reaches heights of up to 20 meters, with a slender trunk and dense, needle-like foliage. The leaves are short, dark green, and arranged in a compact, columnar pattern, giving the tree a distinctive, narrow profile. This variety is often cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes due to its formal appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions. It produces small, cone-like fruits that mature in the second year, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
