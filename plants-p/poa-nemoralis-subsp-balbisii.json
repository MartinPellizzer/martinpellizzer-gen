    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. balbisii, commonly known as the Balbis sedge, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its tolerance to partial shade. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
