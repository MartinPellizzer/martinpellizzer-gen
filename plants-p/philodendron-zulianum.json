    "intro": "Philodendron zulianum, commonly known as the Zulianum philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
