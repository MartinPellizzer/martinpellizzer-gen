    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 pulcherrima, commonly known as the Japanese white pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus pyrifolia (Chinese white pear) and Pyrus ussuriensis (Manchurian pear). It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, sweet, and aromatic fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its aesthetic appeal and edible fruits, it is widely cultivated in gardens and orchards."
