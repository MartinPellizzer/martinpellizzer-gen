    "intro": "Picraena amara, commonly known as bitterleaf, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and yellow flowers, and it produces small, round, green fruits that turn red when mature. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. The plant has traditional medicinal uses in some African cultures."
