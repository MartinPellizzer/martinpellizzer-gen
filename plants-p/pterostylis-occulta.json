    "intro": "Pterostylis occulta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in rainforest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pterostylis occulta is considered a vulnerable species."
