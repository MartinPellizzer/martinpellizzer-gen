    "intro": "Pandanus furcatus var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the broad-leafed pandanus, is a species native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers, which are followed by edible, fibrous fruits. Its adaptability to coastal and sandy soils makes it a common ornamental plant in tropical regions. The variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to other pandanus species."
