    "intro": "Pelea waipioensis, commonly known as the Waipio pelea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and streamside areas. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
