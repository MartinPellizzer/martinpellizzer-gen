    "intro": "Pandanus samoanus, commonly known as the Samoan pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its long, narrow leaves that form a dense crown. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, which are followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are used for thatching and weaving, while the fruit is edible and often used in traditional foods. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
