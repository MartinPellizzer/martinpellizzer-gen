    "intro": "Poa cernua, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Poa cernua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixtures."
