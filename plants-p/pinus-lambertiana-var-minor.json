    "intro": "Pinus lambertiana var. minor, commonly known as the sugar pine dwarf form, is a variant of the sugar pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smaller size compared to the typical sugar pine, with shorter needles and a more compact growth habit. The plant produces cones that mature in the second year, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of long, flexible needles arranged in spirals along the stems. This variety is often found in higher elevation areas where it adapts to cooler and drier conditions."
