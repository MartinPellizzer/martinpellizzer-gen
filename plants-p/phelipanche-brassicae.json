    "intro": "Phelipanche brassicae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the Brassicaceae family, such as cabbages and mustards. The plant's life cycle depends entirely on its host for nutrients and water. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on insects for pollination. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
