    "intro": "Pilosella glaciella, commonly known as the glacial pilosella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant has finely hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella glaciella is often found in rocky soils and mountain meadows, thriving in high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients."
