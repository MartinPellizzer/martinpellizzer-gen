    "intro": "Picea spinulosa var. yatungensis, commonly known as the Yatung fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are short and stiff. The tree produces cones that are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
