    "intro": "Pteris pallens, commonly known as the silver-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with silvery veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams or ponds. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris pallens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
