    "intro": "Phegopteris oppositifolia, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite arrangement of leaflets and its fern-like fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
