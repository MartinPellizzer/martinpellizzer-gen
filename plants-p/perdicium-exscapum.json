    "intro": "Perdicium exscapum, commonly known as the scarlet lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking red petals and tubular shape, which are adapted for pollination by specific species of hummingbirds. The plant has a short, sturdy stem and produces clusters of flowers during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Perdicium exscapum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
