It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. The species is noted for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, relying on capturing microorganisms for sustenance."
