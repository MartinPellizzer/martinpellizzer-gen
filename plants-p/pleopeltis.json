    "intro": "Pleopeltis, commonly known as the rock fern or staghorn fern, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns native to tropical regions. These plants typically grow on rocks or trees, anchoring themselves with their rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. They possess a distinctive frond structure, with a fleshy, lobed shield on the underside that helps retain water. The leaves are usually compound, with a broad, fan-like shape that aids in photosynthesis. Pleopeltis species are valued in horticulture for their unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
