    "intro": "Polygala longifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and delicate, raceme-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, typically white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred structure at the base of each bloom. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
