    "intro": "Phoradendron karuaianum, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native Hawaiian trees. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has a symbiotic relationship with its host, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots that attach to the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its presence can affect the health of its host tree, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even mortality. Due to habitat loss, Phoradendron karuaianum is considered a threatened species in its native range."
