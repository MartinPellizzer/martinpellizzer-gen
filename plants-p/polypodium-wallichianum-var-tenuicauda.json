    "intro": "Polypodium wallichianum var. tenuicauda, commonly known as the slender-tailed maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often covered with a fine layer of brownish spores. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. The varietal form tenuicauda distinguishes it by its slender, tapering fronds compared to the more robust fronds of the typical variety."
