    "intro": "Philodendron correae, commonly known as the Correae Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Philodendron correae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
