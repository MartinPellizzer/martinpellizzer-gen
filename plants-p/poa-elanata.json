    "intro": "Poa elanata, commonly known as the mountain grass or alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, alpine, and subalpine habitats, often in areas with poor soil conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with blue-green glumes. Its leaves are narrow, hairless, and often have a bluish tinge, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Poa elanata is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and on mountain slopes."
