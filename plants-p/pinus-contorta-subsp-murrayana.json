    "intro": "Pinus contorta subsp. murrayana, commonly known as the lodgepole pine, is a subspecies of the ponderosa pine native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically two to three inches long. The cones of this subspecies are usually shorter and more rounded compared to those of other pine species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to fire and its ability to regenerate after disturbances."
