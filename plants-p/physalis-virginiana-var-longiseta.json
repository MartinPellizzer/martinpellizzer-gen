    "intro": "Physalis virginiana var. longiseta, commonly known as the wild tomato or the Chinese lantern plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It produces striking orange-red, inflated calyces that enclose its small, edible berries. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it blooms with yellowish-green flowers in the summer. The fruit is often used in culinary applications, though it is less common than its domesticated relatives."
