It is characterized by its long, climbing stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Piptadenia griffoniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
