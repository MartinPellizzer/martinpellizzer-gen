It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves and small, vibrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or yellow. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive periods of drought. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The grayish hue of its leaves distinguishes it from other varieties of Portulaca."
