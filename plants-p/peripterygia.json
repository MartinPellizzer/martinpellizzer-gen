    "intro": "Peripterygia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce small, yellow flowers that develop into bristled seed heads. Peripterygia species are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and the presence of stipules. They are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
