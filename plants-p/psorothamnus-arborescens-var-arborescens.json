    "intro": "Psorothamnus arborescens var. arborescens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
