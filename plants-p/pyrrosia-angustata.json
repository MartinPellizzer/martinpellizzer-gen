    "intro": "Pyrrosia angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pyrrosia angustata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
