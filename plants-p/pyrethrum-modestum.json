    "intro": "Pyrethrum modestum, commonly known as the modest pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower heads that contain numerous tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins, which are used in organic pest control. Pyrethrum modestum typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
