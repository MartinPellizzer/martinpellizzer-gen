    "intro": "Pulsatilla \u00d7 tarnoviensis, commonly known as the Tarnoviensis Pasqueflower, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pulsatilla vulgaris and Pulsatilla bulbocodium. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms with white petals and a yellow center. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It has hairy stems and palmately divided leaves, and its flowers are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
