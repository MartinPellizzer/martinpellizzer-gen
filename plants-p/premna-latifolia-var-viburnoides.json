    "intro": "Premna latifolia var. viburnoides, commonly known as the broadleaf premna or velvetleaf premna, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves and stems contain mucilage, which has been used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties."
