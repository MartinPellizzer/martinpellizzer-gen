    "intro": "Pentameris horrida, commonly known as the rough pentameris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a slender, upright stem covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a rough texture, contributing to its overall distinctive look. Pentameris horrida is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
