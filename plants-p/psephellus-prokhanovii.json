It is characterized by its dense clusters of spiny, cylindrical stems that resemble a pincushion. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid environments with minimal rainfall and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in collections of rare cacti."
