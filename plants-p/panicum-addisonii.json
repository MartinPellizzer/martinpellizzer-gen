    "intro": "Panicum addisonii, commonly known as Addison's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in wetland ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
