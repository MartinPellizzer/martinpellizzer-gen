    "intro": "Polystichum lactum, commonly known as the milk fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its bioluminescent spore cases, which emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in forest understories. The spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
