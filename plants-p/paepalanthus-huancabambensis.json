    "intro": "Paepalanthus huancabambensis, commonly known as the Huancabamba pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Peru. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 3,000 and 4,500 meters above sea level. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
