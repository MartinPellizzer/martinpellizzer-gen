    "intro": "Pteris ludens, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and marshes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Pteris ludens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic gardens or as a houseplant."
