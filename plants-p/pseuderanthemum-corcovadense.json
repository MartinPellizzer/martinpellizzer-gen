It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, colorful flowers that range from pink to red. The plant produces showy, tubular bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Pseuderanthemum corcovadense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
