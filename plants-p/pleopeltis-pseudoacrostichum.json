    "intro": "Pleopeltis pseudoacrostichum, commonly known as the false water fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
