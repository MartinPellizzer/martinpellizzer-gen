It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
