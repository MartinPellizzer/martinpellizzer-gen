    "intro": "Pernettya phillyreifolia, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its compact form and hardy nature make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems. Pernettya phillyreifolia plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds, through its fruit production."
