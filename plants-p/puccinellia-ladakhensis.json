    "intro": "Puccinellia ladakhensis, commonly known as the Ladakh pennywort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Ladakh. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme climatic conditions. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, forming dense inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Puccinellia ladakhensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife in its native habitat."
