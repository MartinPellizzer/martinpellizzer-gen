    "intro": "Panicum yadkinense, commonly known as Yadkin panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes during the summer months. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
