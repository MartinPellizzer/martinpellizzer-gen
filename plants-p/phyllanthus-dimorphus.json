    "intro": "Phyllanthus dimorphus, commonly known as the two-form milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Phyllanthus dimorphus is also notable for its potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
