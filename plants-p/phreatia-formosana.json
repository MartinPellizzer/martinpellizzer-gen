    "intro": "Phreatia formosana, commonly known as the Formosan ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Taiwan. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, almost ghost-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high rainfall. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native habitat."
