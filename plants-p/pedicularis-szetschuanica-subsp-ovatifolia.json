    "intro": "Pedicularis szetschuanica subsp. ovatifolia, commonly known as the Chinese lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after species in botanical gardens and among horticultural enthusiasts."
