    "intro": "Polygala sibirica var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Asia, particularly Siberia and parts of Mongolia. It typically grows in alpine and subarctic regions, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, delicate leaves with a lanceolate shape. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters, and are characteristic of the Polygala genus. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific cold-hardiness requirements."
