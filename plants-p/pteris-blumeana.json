    "intro": "Pteris blumeana, commonly known as the Blume's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread easily in suitable habitats. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters, making it a visually striking plant in both natural and cultivated settings."
