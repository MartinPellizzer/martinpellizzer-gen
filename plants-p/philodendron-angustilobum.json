    "intro": "Philodendron angustilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive narrow lobing at the base, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are typically followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
