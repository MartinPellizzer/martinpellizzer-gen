    "intro": "Pedicularis plicata var. typica, commonly known as the zigzag monkeyflower, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, with their unique shape facilitating nectar access."
