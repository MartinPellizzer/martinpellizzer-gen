    "intro": "Phyllanthus crassinervius, commonly known as the broad-veined phyllanthus, is a small shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
