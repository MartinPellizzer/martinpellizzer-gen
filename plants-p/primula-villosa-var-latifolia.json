    "intro": "Primula villosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features rosettes of ovate, hairy, and sometimes broad leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and early blooming habit."
