    "intro": "Polypodium wardii, commonly known as the Ward's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Polypodium wardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
