    "intro": "Pedicularis macrosiphon var. tribuloides, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble the face of a monkey. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and vibrant color make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
