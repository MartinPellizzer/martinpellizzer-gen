    "intro": "Poa cucullata subsp. cucullata, commonly known as the hooded bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
