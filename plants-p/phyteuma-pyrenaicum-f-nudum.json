    "intro": "Phyteuma pyrenaicum f. nudum, commonly known as the naked phyteuma, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a tendency to remain largely leafless during the winter months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
