    "intro": "Polypodium arcuatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often curl or arc in appearance, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Polypodium arcuatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various substrates."
