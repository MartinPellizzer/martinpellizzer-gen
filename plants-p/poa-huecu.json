It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has slender, tufted shoots and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Poa huecu plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
