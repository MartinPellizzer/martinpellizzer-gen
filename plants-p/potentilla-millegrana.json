    "intro": "Potentilla millegrana, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
