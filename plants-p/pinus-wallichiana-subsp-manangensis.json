    "intro": "Pinus wallichiana subsp. manangensis, commonly known as the Manang pine, is a subspecies native to the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. It is a tall coniferous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a straight trunk and a conical crown. The needles are long, typically 5\u20138 cm, and are arranged in bundles of five, giving the tree a distinctive appearance. Its cones are woody and can persist on the tree for several years before opening to release seeds. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native region."
