    "intro": "Pandanus remotus, commonly known as the remote pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. The remote pandanus is valued both for its aesthetic appeal and its cultural significance in the regions where it is found."
