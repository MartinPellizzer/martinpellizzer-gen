    "intro": "Pteracanthus congestus, commonly known as the dense-leafed pteracanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its foliage is dense and glossy, with leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
