    "intro": "Potentilla santolinoides, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Potentilla santolinoides is well adapted to rocky soils and cold climates, making it a hardy species found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
