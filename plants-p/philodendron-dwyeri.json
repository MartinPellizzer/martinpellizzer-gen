    "intro": "Philodendron dwyeri, commonly known as the Dwyer's philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth and striking foliage make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
