    "intro": "Ptychosperma litigiosum var. oninense, commonly known as the Oninense palm, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical studies."
