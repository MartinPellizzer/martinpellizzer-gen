    "intro": "Potentilla palustris, commonly known as marsh cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring a sprawling or upright growth habit. The plant has small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge, while the stems are usually hairy. Potentilla palustris thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
