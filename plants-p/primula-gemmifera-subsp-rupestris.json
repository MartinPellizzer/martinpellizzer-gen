It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
