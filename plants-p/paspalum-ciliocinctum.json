    "intro": "Paspalum ciliocinctum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal areas, tolerating salty air and sandy soils, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sand, it plays an important ecological role in coastal environments."
