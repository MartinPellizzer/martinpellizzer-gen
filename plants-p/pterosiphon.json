It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, showy flower surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Pterosiphon species are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and small, delicate leaves. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking, almost ethereal appearance."
