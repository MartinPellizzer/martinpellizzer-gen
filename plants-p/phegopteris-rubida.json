    "intro": "Phegopteris rubida, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its bright red coloration on the underside of its fronds, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Phegopteris rubida plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
