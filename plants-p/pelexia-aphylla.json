    "intro": "Pelexia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless pelexia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant lacks true leaves, instead possessing modified structures called phyllodes that perform photosynthesis. Its small, pale yellow flowers are arranged in dense spikes, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Pelexia aphylla is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
