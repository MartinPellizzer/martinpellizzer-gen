    "intro": "Phylica cuspidata var. minor, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. The Cape snowbush is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
