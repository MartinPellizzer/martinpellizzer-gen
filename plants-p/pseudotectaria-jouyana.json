    "intro": "Pseudotectaria jouyana, commonly known as the African mountain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds."
