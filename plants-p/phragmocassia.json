    "intro": "Phragmocassia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Phragmocassia is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It is considered an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
