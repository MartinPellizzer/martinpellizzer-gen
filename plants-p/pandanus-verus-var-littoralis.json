    "intro": "Pandanus verus var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves. This variant is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
