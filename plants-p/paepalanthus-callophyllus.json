It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Paepalanthus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
