    "intro": "Phyllanthus shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its small, green leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phyllanthus shaferi is considered a rare and endangered species."
