    "intro": "Pityrodia flexuosa, commonly known as the wattle tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow floral spikes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Pityrodia flexuosa is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
