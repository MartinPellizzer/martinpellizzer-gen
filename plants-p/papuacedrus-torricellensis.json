    "intro": "Papuacedrus torricellensis, commonly known as the Torricella cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the highlands of New Guinea. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dense, scale-like foliage. The plant belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is notable for its slow growth and longevity. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
