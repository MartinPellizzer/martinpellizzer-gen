    "intro": "Palaquium rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-stemmed wax apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spherical, orange to red fruits with a waxy coating. Its fruits are edible, though often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
