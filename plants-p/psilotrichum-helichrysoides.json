    "intro": "Psilotrichum helichrysoides, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and habitat requirements make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
