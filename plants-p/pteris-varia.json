    "intro": "Pteris varia, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. Pteris varia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
