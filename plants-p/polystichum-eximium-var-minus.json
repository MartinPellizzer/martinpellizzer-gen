    "intro": "Polystichum eximium var. minus, commonly known as the lesser tailed fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are often shorter and more compact compared to its parent species. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a fine, feathery texture that gives it a soft, elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
