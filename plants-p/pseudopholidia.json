    "intro": "Pseudopholidia, commonly known as the false flax or false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. These plants typically have palmate leaves and produce showy, often pink or purple, flowers that attract pollinators. The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Pseudopholidia species are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value and potential therapeutic properties."
