    "intro": "Polygonum senegalense var. robustum, commonly known as the Senegalese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as riverbanks and grasslands."
