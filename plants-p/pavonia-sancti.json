It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that resemble petals, though they are actually modified leaves. It produces small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer months. Pavonia sancti thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
