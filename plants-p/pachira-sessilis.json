    "intro": "Pachira sessilis, commonly known as the dwarf pachira or Brazilian money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. Pachira sessilis thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil."
