    "intro": "Pritchardia moensii, commonly known as the Mauna Loa cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Hawaii. It is a small, slow-growing cycad with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, strap-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiky male and female cones that appear on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
