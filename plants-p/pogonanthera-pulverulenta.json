    "intro": "Pogonanthera pulverulenta, commonly known as the dusty pogonanthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
