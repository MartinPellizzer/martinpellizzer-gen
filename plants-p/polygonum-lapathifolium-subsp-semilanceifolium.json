The leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, fields, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
