The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically green or red, which are followed by tiny, fleshy fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and ease of care contribute to its appeal among plant enthusiasts."
