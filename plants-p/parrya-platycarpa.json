It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a distinctive, broad, oval-shaped schizocarp, which splits into two parts when mature. Parrya platycarpa is often found in moist, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
