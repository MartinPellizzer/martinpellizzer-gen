    "intro": "Pinus langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are usually reddish-brown in color, containing both male and female reproductive structures. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
