    "intro": "Petasites sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant features a robust, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual element to its alpine and subarctic habitats."
