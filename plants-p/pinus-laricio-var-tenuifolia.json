    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender lace pine, is a variant of the stone pine native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the standard Pinus laricio. The tree produces cones that are often smaller and more elongated compared to the typical species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta."
