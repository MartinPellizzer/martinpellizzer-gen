    "intro": "Poa imbecilla, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that are well adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, Poa imbecilla is a common component of alpine and subalpine vegetation."
