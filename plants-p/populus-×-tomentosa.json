    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 tomentosa, commonly known as the Chinese balm or tomentose poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, white, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin, papery layers. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
