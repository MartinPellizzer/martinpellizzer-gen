    "intro": "Prunus spinosa subsp. insititioides, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
