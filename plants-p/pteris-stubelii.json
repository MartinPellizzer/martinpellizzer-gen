    "intro": "Pteris stubelii, commonly known as the St\u00fcbner's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris stubelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
