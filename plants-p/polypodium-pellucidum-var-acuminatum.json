    "intro": "Polypodium pellucidum var. acuminatum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a variant of the common rock fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is distinguished by its acuminate (tapered) leaf tips, which give it its specific name."
