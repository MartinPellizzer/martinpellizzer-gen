    "intro": "Primulina sclerophylla, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Its leaves are thick and leathery, an adaptation to its arid and exposed habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Primulina sclerophylla is considered a vulnerable species."
