    "intro": "Polystichum caripense, commonly known as the Caripense shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in humid lowland forests. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polystichum caripense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
