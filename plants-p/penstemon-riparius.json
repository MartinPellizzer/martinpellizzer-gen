    "intro": "Penstemon riparius, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardtongue, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tubular flowers that range in color from violet to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a fuzzy texture. Penstemon riparius is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry meadows and open woodlands."
