    "intro": "Polyarrhena prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate polyarrhena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
