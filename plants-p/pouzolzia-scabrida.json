    "intro": "Pouzolzia scabrida, commonly known as rough pouzolzia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a rough, scaly texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in sandy or well-drained soils. Pouzolzia scabrida is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and wind."
