    "intro": "Parrya nudicaulis subsp. interior, commonly known as the interior parrya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
