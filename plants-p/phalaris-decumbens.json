    "intro": "Phalaris decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate grass or flat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features spreading, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and form a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover."
