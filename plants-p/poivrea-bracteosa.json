It is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
