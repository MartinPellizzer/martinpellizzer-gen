    "intro": "Polylepis hieronymi var. saltensis, commonly known as the Saltanensis Polylepis, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, small, and often frost-covered leaves, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The tree produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against strong winds and temperature fluctuations. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
