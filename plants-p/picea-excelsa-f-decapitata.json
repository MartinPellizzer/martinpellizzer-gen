    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. decapitata, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a unique variant of the white spruce tree. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more densely packed branches compared to the typical white spruce. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, rounded shape. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically a silvery-blue or gray-green color. It is adapted to cooler climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions where it thrives in well-drained soils."
