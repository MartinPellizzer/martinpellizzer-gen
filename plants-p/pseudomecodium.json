    "intro": "Pseudomecodium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. Pseudomecodium species are typically small, herbaceous plants with opposite leaves and showy bracts. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated as houseplants, though they require specific care to thrive."
