    "intro": "Paraleptochilus decurrens var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate paraleptochilus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
