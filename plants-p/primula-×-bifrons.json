    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 bifrons, commonly known as the hybrid primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. The hybrid nature of Primula \u00d7 bifrons results from crosses between different species within the Primula genus, contributing to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
