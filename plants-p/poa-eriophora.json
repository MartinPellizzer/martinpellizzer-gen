    "intro": "Poa eriophora, commonly known as the bentgrass or narrowleaf bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, dark green foliage. The plant typically forms dense mats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa eriophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
