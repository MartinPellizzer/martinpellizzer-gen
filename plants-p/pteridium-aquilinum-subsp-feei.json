    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. feei, commonly known as the Chinese bracken, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widely distributed P. aquilinum."
