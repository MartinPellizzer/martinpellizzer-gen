    "intro": "Petalactella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrients. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nourishment from them. Its botanical features include a slender stem and small, ephemeral blooms that appear in late summer. Due to its unique adaptations and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
