It is characterized by its fine, silver-hued leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a slender, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
