    "intro": "Pseudencyclia neglecta, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its drought tolerance. Pseudencyclia neglecta is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
