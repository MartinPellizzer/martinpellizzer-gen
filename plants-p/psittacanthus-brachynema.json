    "intro": "Psittacanthus brachynema, commonly known as the short-stemmed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tree-like appearance with a dense, branching frond structure. The plant's fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive velvety underside that gives it a unique texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, porous substrates for optimal growth. Psittacanthus brachynema is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
