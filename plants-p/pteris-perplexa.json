    "intro": "Pteris perplexa, commonly known as the confused water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a complex and intricate appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor or in aquatic settings. Pteris perplexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
