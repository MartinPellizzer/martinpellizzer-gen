    "intro": "Polypodium fischerianum, commonly known as the Fischer's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the air. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters."
