    "intro": "Pronephrium simplex, commonly known as the simple pronephrium, is a type of aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched root system and its ability to absorb nutrients directly from the surrounding water. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water absorption. Pronephrium simplex plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering out excess nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
