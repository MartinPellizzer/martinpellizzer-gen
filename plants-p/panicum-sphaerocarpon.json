    "intro": "Panicum sphaerocarpon, commonly known as the spherical panic grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, spherical spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in humid climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the inflorescence consists of tightly packed, round spikelets that give it its distinctive appearance. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
