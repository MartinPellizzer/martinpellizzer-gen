    "intro": "Poterium spachianum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are densely arranged along the stems, giving it a dense, grass-like appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaf size compared to other varieties within the species."
