    "intro": "Paraboea detergibilis, commonly known as the soapberry plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain a toxic, milky latex sap, which has been historically used for its cleansing properties. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic compounds, it is important to handle the plant with care."
