It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and ornamental foliage, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
