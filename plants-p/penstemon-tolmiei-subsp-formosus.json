It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in high-elevation environments. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
