    "intro": "Prosopis spicigera, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spicate inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Prosopis spicigera is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
