It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its botanical features make it both an interesting subject for study and a unique addition to specialized plant collections."
