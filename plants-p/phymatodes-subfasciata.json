    "intro": "Phymatodes subfasciata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
