    "intro": "Physalis heterophylla var. timbo, commonly known as the Timbo husk tomato, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its unique, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its fruit, which resembles a small, yellow or orange lantern, matures in late summer and is edible when fully ripe. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both culinary and medicinal uses in traditional practices."
