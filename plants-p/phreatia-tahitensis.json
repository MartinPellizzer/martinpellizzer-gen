    "intro": "Phreatia tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Society Islands of French Polynesia. It is an epiphytic plant, growing on trees in humid, tropical environments, and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and limited natural propagation, Phreatia tahitensis is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
