    "intro": "Paphiopedilum philippinense var. roebelenii, commonly known as the Philippine lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, velvety petals and a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a distinctive feature of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the undergrowth of tropical forests. It has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
