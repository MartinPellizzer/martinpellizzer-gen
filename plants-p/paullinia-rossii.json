    "intro": "Paullinia rossii, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Paullinia rossii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
