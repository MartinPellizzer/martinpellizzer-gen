    "intro": "Pandanus albibracteatus, commonly known as the white bract pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in coastal and wetland environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in humid, saline conditions."
