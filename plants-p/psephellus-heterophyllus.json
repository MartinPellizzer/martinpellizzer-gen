    "intro": "Psephellus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable leaf dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from elliptical to ovate, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on morphological plasticity in plants."
