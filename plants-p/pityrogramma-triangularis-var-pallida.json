    "intro": "Pityrogramma triangularis var. pallida, commonly known as the pale water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically pale green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its ability to colonize wet soils. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in fine, silky hairs."
