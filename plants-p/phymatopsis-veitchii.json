    "intro": "Phymatopsis veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's phymatopsis, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Phymatopsis veitchii is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
