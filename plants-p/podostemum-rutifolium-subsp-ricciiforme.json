It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as riverbanks and ponds. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred structure.
