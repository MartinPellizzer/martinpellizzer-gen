    "intro": "Pteris chrysodioides, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. Native to Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
