    "intro": "Polypteris lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Polypteris lindenii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
