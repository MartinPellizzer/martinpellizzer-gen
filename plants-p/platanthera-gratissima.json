    "intro": "Platanthera gratissima, commonly known as the sweet piper, is a species of orchid native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, flowering stem that typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive greenish tinge. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, and its growth is closely associated with specific fungal symbionts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
