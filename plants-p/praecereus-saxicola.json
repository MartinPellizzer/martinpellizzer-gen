    "intro": "Praecereus saxicola, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species native to arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing, stem-based cactus that forms dense mats, often covering rocky outcrops. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in spring and attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Praecereus saxicola is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens."
