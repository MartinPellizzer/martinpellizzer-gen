    "intro": "Pistia leprieuri, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosettes of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly."
