    "intro": "Panax tridactylon, commonly known as the lesser ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain the seeds, and its root system is the primary part used in traditional medicine. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its potential health benefits. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in some regions."
