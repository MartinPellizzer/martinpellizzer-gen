    "intro": "Pterophylla minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pterophylla, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink, often appearing in early spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterophylla minutiflora is considered a species of conservation concern."
