    "intro": "Petrocosmea xanthomaculata, commonly known as the yellow-spotted rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with distinctive black markings, which are unique to this species. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its rugged habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
