    "intro": "Persea major, commonly known as the Mexican avocado or bigleaf avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The tree's fruit is a large, pear-shaped berry with a smooth, dark green skin and a creamy, oily pulp. The fruit is highly valued for its nutritional content, particularly its high monounsaturated fat content. Persea major thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
