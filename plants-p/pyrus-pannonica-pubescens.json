It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, sweet fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
