    "intro": "Pentapogon inaequiglumis, commonly known as the unequal-awned grass, is a species of flowering plant in the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bracts that are often unequal in length, giving it its specific epithet. It is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wind pollination and efficient seed dispersal."
