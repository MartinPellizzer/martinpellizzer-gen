    "intro": "Physalis pruinosa, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, bluish-green foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces inflated, papery calyces that enclose its bright orange to red berries, which are edible when ripe. These berries are often used in culinary applications, though the plant contains toxic compounds in its leaves and unripe fruits. Physalis pruinosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
