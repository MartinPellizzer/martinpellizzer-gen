    "intro": "Planchonia nitida, commonly known as the silky whitewood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
