    "intro": "Potentilla ronchii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of silvery-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Potentilla ronchii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes."
