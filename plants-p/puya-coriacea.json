    "intro": "Puya coriacea, commonly known as the Andean puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a dense spike, and bloom for a short period during the dry season. Puya coriacea is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found growing in rocky or open areas."
