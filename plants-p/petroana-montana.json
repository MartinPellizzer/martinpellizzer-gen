    "intro": "Petroana montana, commonly known as the mountain petroana, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Petroana montana is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species found in mountainous regions."
