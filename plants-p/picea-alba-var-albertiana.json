    "intro": "Picea alba var. albertiana, commonly known as the white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce tree native to North America. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles, and distinctive white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ecological importance and is also used in reforestation efforts."
