    "intro": "Psoralidium linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf psoralidium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
