    "intro": "Panicum ramosissimum, commonly known as bush bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, branching structure that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, blue-green flowers in late summer, which are arranged in panicles. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. It is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites."
