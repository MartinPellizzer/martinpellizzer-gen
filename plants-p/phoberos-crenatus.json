    "intro": "Phoberos crenatus, commonly known as the crested phoberos, is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its distinctive, crinkled or wavy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native habitat."
