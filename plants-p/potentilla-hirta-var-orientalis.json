It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
