    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum occidentale, commonly known as the western paraprasophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which consists of dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
