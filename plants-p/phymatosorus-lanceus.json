    "intro": "Phymatosorus lanceus, commonly known as the lance-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a glossy appearance, with a complex arrangement of pinnae. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
