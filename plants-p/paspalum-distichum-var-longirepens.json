    "intro": "Paspalum distichum var. longirepens, commonly known as the longleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ability to tolerate flooding and its ecological importance, it plays a significant role in wetland ecosystems."
