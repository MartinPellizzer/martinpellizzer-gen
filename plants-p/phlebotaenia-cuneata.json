    "intro": "Phlebotaenia cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming species that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in two rows, giving it a distinct appearance. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are borne on the leaf surfaces and produce both male and female reproductive cells. Phlebotaenia cuneata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
