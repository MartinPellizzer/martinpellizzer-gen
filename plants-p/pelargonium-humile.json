    "intro": "Pelargonium humile, commonly known as the dwarf geranium, is a small, compact perennial plant native to South Africa. It features broad, rounded leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance ornamental plants. Pelargonium humile is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
