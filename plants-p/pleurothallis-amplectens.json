It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to thrive in captivity."
