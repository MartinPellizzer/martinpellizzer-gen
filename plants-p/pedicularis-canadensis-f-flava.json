It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
