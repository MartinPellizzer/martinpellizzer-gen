    "intro": "Polypodium griffithianum var. majoense, commonly known as the Majoense shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with distinctive sori. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and may develop a waxy coating, which aids in reducing water loss in its natural habitat."
