    "intro": "Pteris splendida var. splendida, commonly known as the shining water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are often adorned with a waxy coating, giving them a shimmering appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
