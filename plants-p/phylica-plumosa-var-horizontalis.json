    "intro": "Phylica plumosa var. horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal flame bush, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, horizontal branching pattern and its profuse display of small, bright yellow flowers that appear in winter. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce red, woody fruits that persist into spring."
