    "intro": "Polygonum \u00d7 figertii, commonly known as the hybrid knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple undersurface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
