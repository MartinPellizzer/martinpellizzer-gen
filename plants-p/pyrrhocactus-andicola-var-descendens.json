    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus andicola var. descendens, commonly known as the descending pyrrhocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, woolly spines that provide protection against herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments with well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
