    "intro": "Polypodium elongatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes that allow it to climb and spread across various surfaces. The plant produces fertile fronds with spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a single row along the underside of the leaves. Its leaves are usually bipinnately compound, with a distinct, elongated shape. Polypodium elongatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
