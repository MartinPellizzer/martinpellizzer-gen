    "intro": "Psilonema minimum, commonly known as the small psilotum, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the absence of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are closely clustered at the tips of its stems. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Due to its primitive features, it is considered a living fossil, providing insights into early plant evolution."
