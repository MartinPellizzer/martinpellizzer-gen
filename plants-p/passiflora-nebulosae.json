    "intro": "Passiflora nebulosae, commonly known as the nebulous passionflower, is a rare and striking species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, colorful flowers that feature a unique combination of blue, purple, and white petals, along with a prominent crown of filaments. The plant produces edible berries that are typically small and yellow when ripe. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring high humidity and shade, which makes it challenging to cultivate outside its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Passiflora nebulosae is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
