    "intro": "Polystachya minutiflora, commonly known as the minute-flowered polystachya, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in a loose, branched inflorescence. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid tropical climates. Due to its small size and subtle appearance, it is often overlooked but is valued in horticulture for its unique ornamental qualities."
