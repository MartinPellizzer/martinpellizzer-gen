    "intro": "Paspalum preslii, commonly known as the Preslii grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering structures. Paspalum preslii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland restoration projects."
