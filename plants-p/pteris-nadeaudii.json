It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble miniature trees. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Pteris nadeaudii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
