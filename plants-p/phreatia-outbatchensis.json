    "intro": "Phreatia outbatchensis, commonly known as the Outbatch ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green to white flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its roots are specialized for absorbing water from the humid environment, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
