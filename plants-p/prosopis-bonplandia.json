    "intro": "Prosopis bonplandia, commonly known as the Paraguay thorn tree, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various animals. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry regions. Prosopis bonplandia also has deep roots that help prevent soil erosion and improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
