    "intro": "Phalaris caesia, commonly known as blue grass or sea grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Phalaris caesia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
