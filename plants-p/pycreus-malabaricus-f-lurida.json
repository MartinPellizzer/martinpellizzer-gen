    "intro": "Pycreus malabaricus f. lurida, commonly known as the Malabar pyrethrum, is a rare and distinctive variant of the pyrethrum plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its striking, pale yellow to white flower heads that contrast with its dark green, velvety foliage. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. Its flowers produce pyrethrin, a natural insecticide, making it significant in botanical and agricultural contexts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts."
