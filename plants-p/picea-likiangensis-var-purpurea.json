    "intro": "Picea likiangensis var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple spruce, is a rare variant of the Chinese spruce native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-blue needles and cones, which give it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its foliage is dense and evergreen, providing habitat for various alpine species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
