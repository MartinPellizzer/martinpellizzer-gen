    "intro": "Penstemon laevis, commonly known as the smooth beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Penstemon laevis is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
