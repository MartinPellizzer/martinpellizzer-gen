    "intro": "Pseudocayratia oligocarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited cayratia, is a climbing shrub belonging to the family Rosaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a globose capsule that contains several small, hard seeds. Pseudocayratia oligocarpa is often found in forest understories and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
