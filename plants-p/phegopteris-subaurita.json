    "intro": "Phegopteris subaurita, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. The fern's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of forest ecosystems."
