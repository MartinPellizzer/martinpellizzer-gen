    "intro": "Prosopis glandulosa, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in small glands that secrete a sticky substance. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments and has deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Prosopis glandulosa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
