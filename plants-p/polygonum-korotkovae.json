    "intro": "Polygonum korotkovae, commonly known as the Korotkov's knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats and sorrels. The plant is characterized by its upright stems, alternate leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
