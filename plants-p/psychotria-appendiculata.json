    "intro": "Psychotria appendiculata, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's breath,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are often clustered in terminal panicles. The plant is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which contribute to its historical use in traditional medicine and ritual practices."
