    "intro": "Pentagonia brachyotis, commonly known as the dwarf pentagonia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, pentagonal-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Due to its unique leaf structure and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of horticultural circles."
