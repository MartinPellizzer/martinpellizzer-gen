    "intro": "Philodendron, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the arum family, Araceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and climbing or trailing growth habit. Many species have aerial roots that allow them to attach to surfaces as they grow. The plant produces small, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Philodendrons are popular houseplants due to their adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
