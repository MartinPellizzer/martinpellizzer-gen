    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf potentilla, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine landscapes."
