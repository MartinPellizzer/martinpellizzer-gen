    "intro": "Phyllanthus columnaris, commonly known as the columnar phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which makes it a striking addition to gardens. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and typically have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Phyllanthus columnaris is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
