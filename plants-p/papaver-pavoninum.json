    "intro": "Papaver pavoninum, commonly known as the peacock poppy, is a striking annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow, with intricate patterns resembling a peacock's tail. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Papaver pavoninum is cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
