    "intro": "Pontia bauhini, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, come in shades of yellow and white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
