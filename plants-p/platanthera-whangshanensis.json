    "intro": "Platanthera whangshanensis, commonly known as the Whangshan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the rich, organic soil in its habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
