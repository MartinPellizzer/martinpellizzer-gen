It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant typically has broad, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
