    "intro": "Puccinellia phryganodes subsp. neoarctica, commonly known as the Arctic puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is an important component of tundra vegetation and plays a role in stabilizing soil in polar ecosystems."
