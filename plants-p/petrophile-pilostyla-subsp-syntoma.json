    "intro": "Petrophile pilostyla subsp. syntoma, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Geebung, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a member of the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive, urn-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland or open woodland habitats. It is a small shrub that produces bright red or pink flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
