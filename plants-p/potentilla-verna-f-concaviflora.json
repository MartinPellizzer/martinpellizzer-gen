    "intro": "Potentilla verna f. concaviflora, commonly known as the concave-flowered cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with small, rounded leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically arranged in a basal rosette and have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are characterized by their concave shape and five petals, which distinguish it from other Potentilla species. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
