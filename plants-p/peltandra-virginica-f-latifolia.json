    "intro": "Peltandra virginica f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are broad and often have a waxy surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, which are borne on slender stalks. The broadleaf form is distinguished by its wider leaves compared to the typical variety, making it a striking addition to moist garden environments."
