    "intro": "Puccinellia caespitosa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to thrive in soils with high salt content and poor nutrients. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Puccinellia caespitosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
