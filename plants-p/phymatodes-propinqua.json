It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that emit a milky sap when damaged. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Phymatodes propinqua plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and is an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
