    "intro": "Pyrus altaica, commonly known as the Siberian pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are similar to pears. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its fruit and medicinal properties."
