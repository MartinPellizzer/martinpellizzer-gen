    "intro": "Poa rigida var. maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This variety is well adapted to harsh maritime environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
