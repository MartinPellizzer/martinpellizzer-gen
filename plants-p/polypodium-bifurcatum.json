    "intro": "Polypodium bifurcatum, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or trifoliate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
