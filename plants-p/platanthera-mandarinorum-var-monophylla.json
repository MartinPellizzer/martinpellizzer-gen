    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum var. monophylla, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration, often featuring a combination of white, green, and yellow hues. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
