    "intro": "Petrophyton, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments where it can absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding substrate. Petrophyton is characterized by its ability to grow on various types of rock surfaces, including limestone, granite, and basalt. Its structure is usually crust-like or foliose, allowing it to adhere firmly to the substrate. This plant plays a vital ecological role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in rocky ecosystems."
