    "intro": "Poiretia psoraloides, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Poiretia psoraloides is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments."
