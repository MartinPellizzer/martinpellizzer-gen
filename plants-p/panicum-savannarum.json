    "intro": "Panicum savannarum, commonly known as inland sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, hairless stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland and marsh environments. It is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as swamps and along riverbanks."
