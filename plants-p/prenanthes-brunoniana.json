    "intro": "Prenanthes brunoniana, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple hue and produces tall, spire-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. The plant is adapted to moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
