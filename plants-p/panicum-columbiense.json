    "intro": "Panicum columbiense, commonly known as Columbia panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, gray-green leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-brown panicles that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
