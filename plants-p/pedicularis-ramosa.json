The plant features striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. Its leaves are alternate and often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Pedicularis ramosa is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it blooms during the summer months."
