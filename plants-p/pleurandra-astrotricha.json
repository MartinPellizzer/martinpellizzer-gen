    "intro": "Pleurandra astrotricha, commonly known as the star-veined pleurandra, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves with prominent, star-like veins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
