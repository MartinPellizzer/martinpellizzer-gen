It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, serrated leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a disc-like pattern. Psiadia serrata is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and seeds for birds."
