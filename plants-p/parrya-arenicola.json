    "intro": "Parrya arenicola, commonly known as the sandstone parrya, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as sandstone outcrops and gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Parrya arenicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
