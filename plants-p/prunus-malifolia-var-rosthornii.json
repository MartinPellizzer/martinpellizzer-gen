    "intro": "Prunus malifolia var. rosthornii, commonly known as the Rostrhorn cherry, is a variant of the Prunus malifolia species native to certain regions of Central America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the summer. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth texture and a dark green color, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in both horticulture and local food systems."
