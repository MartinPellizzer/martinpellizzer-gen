    "intro": "Polypodium nerifolium var. acuminatissimum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed polypody. It is a tropical fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often densely packed. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to vertical surfaces. This variety is noted for its distinctive, acuminate leaf tips and is often found in mountainous regions."
