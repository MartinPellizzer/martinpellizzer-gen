    "intro": "Perymenium cervantesii, commonly known as the Cervantes' bladderworts, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping aquatic invertebrates, a feature typical of its carnivorous relatives. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor freshwater environments, often found in shallow, still waters. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface, displaying a unique blue-violet color. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
