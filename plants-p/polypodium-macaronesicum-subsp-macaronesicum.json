    "intro": "Polypodium macaronesicum subsp. macaronesicum, commonly known as the Macaronesian shield fern, is a fern species native to the Macaronesian region, including the Canary Islands, Madeira, and Azores. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically pinnate with a dense arrangement of pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This fern is notable for its adaptability to volcanic soils and its role in the unique flora of the subtropical Atlantic islands."
