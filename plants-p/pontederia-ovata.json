    "intro": "Pontederia ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyacinth, is a flowering aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to wetland environments. It is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving rivers. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native habitats."
