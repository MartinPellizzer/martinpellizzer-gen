The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in umbels. It is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and the Carpathians. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to its extreme habitat, with a compact growth form and a deep root system."
