    "intro": "Pilocereus verheinei, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habit, with large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Pilocereus verheinei is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
