It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the biodiversity in its native habitat."
