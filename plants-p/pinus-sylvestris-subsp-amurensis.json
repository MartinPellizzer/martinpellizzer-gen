It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in temperate climates, often in mountainous or forested areas. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in bundles of five, which are persistent for several years. Its cones are woody and contain two-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its timber and is also used in ornamental horticulture due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
