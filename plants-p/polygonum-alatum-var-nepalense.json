It is characterized by its distinctive wing-like structures on the stems, which are composed of small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
