    "intro": "Poa viscosa var. pilosissima, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass genus characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, acidic soils, particularly in grasslands and heathlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
