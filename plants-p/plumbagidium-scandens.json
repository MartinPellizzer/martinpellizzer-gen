    "intro": "Plumbagidium scandens, commonly known as creeping leadwort, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
