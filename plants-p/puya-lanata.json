    "intro": "Puya lanata, commonly known as the woolly puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, spiky, woolly leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
