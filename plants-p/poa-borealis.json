    "intro": "Poa borealis, commonly known as Arctic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has fine, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Poa borealis plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its extreme environment."
