    "intro": "Polycodium sericeum, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a fibrous root system and slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, silky, silver-tomentose seed heads. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. Polycodium sericeum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in a variety of ecological conditions."
