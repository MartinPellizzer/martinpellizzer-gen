    "intro": "Pilularia globulifera, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. Pilularia globulifera is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
