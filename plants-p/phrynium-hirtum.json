    "intro": "Phrynium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy phrynium, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests or along riverbanks. Phrynium hirtum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its traditional uses in local medicine."
