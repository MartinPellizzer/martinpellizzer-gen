    "intro": "Parietaria, commonly known as wallweed or buttercup grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along walls, roadsides, and in wetlands. Parietaria species are known for their allergenic properties, as they can cause skin irritation and respiratory issues in sensitive individuals. The genus includes several species, with Parietaria judicaria and Parietaria setifera being among the most common."
