    "intro": "Polypodium lanuginosum, commonly known as the flannel fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a dense, woolly frond that gives it its common name, with the underside covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a translucent indusium. Polypodium lanuginosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
