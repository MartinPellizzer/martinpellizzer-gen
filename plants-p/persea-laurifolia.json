    "intro": "Persea laurifolia, commonly known as the Mexican laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, sweet fruits known as cherimoyas. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it can grow up to 15 meters tall in suitable conditions. Persea laurifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of nutritious fruit."
