It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often have a striking variegation pattern. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Primulina multifida thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is a popular houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
