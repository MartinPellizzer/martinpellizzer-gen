    "intro": "Philodendron muricatum, commonly known as the velvet leaf philodendron, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its deep green, velvety leaves that are often marked with irregular white or silver veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its stems are thick and often have a woody texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by reddish berries. It is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
