    "intro": "Petrosedum reflexum, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing succulent native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Petrosedum reflexum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
