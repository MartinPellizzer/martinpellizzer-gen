    "intro": "Polystichum deflexum, commonly known as the drooping holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are bipinnate, with fine, linear pinnae that create a lacy effect. Polystichum deflexum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
