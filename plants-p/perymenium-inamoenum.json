    "intro": "Perymenium inamoenum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. It is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Perymenium inamoenum is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
