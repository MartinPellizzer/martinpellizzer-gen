    "intro": "Prasophyllum brainei, commonly known as the black leek orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its dark purple to black-colored flowers and strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows in heathland and woodland habitats, often in nutrient-poor soils. Prasophyllum brainei is known for its unique floral structure, which includes a single, elongated flower spike with a single or occasionally two flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
