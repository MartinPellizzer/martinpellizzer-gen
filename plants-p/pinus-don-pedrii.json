    "intro": "Pinus don-pedrii, commonly known as the Canary Island pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that forms a conical shape. The leaves are long, slender, and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds. This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and coastal climates, making it a resilient and distinctive species in its native habitat."
