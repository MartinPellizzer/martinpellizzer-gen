    "intro": "Pseudojacobaea, commonly known as the false Jacob's tea, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically range in color from white to yellow. They are native to various regions in Europe and Asia, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Pseudojacobaea species are perennial herbs with basal rosettes of leaves and tall, branched stems. The genus is sometimes confused with true Jacob's tea due to similar flower structures, but they are distinct in their botanical features."
