It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and healthy wetland environments."
