    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 irishiana, commonly known as the Irish white poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white poplar (Populus alba) and the trembling aspen (Populus tremula). It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, often white- or grey-colored bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-lobed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Populus \u00d7 irishiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
