    "intro": "Prunus persica subsp. laevis, commonly known as the flatpebble peach, is a subspecies of the peach tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous fruit surface, distinguishing it from other peach varieties. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by the development of fleshy, edible fruits. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, typical of the Prunus genus. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated for both its fruit and aesthetic appeal."
