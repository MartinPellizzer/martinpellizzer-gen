    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 estesii, commonly known as the Estes' lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
