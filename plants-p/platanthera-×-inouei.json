    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 inouei, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a fascinating botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Platanthera chlorophaea and Platanthera psycodes. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a pouch-like labellum that serves as a pollination trap. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellow, with a distinctive scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in its native range."
