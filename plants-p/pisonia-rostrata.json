    "intro": "Pisonia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrata hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, pink or red bract-like flowers that are often mistaken for petals. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by large, ornamental bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance."
