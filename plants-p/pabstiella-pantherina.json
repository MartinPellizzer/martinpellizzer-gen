It is characterized by its striking, dark purple to black petals and a distinctive, elongated flower structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Pabstiella pantherina is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
