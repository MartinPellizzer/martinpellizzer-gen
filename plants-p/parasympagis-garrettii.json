    "intro": "Parasympagis garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's parasympagis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are slender and often branched. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
