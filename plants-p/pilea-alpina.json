    "intro": "Pilea alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Pilea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically heart-shaped or kidney-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage. Pilea alpina is relatively low maintenance and prefers indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
