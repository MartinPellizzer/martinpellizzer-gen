    "intro": "Pyrus parva, commonly known as the dwarf pear, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by green, edible fruits that ripen to a yellowish color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. Pyrus parva is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture."
