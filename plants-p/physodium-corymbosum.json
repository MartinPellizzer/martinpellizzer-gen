It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, and its flowering stems bear small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in corymbs. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous root system, which contributes to its medicinal and culinary uses. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions. Physodium corymbosum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
