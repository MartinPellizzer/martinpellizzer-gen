    "intro": "Paramongaia multiflora, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant prefers well-draining soil and indirect sunlight, making it a popular houseplant. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture, which helps it thrive in humid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
