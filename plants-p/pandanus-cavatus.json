    "intro": "Pandanus cavatus, commonly known as the hollow pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by fruiting structures called infrutescences. Its unique hollow stems make it distinct from other pandanus species and are often used in construction and basket weaving. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
