    "intro": "Poa arctica var. vivipara, commonly known as the Arctic grass or viviparous Arctic grass, is a perennial species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common component of tundra ecosystems. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can take root and grow independently, aiding in its propagation. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms."
