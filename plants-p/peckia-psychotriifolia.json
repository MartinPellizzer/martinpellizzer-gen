    "intro": "Peckia psychotriifolia, commonly known as the psychotriifoliate peckia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is adapted to cold and arid conditions, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peckia psychotriifolia is considered a vulnerable species."
