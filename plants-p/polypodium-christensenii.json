    "intro": "Polypodium christensenii, commonly known as the Christensen's huperzia, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
