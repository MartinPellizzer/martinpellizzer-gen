    "intro": "Plocama asperuliformis, commonly known as the roughleaf plocama, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in the spring. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
