    "intro": "Paliurus colubrina, commonly known as the red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. Paliurus colubrina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats."
