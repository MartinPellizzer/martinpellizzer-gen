It features showy, bright yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive central disc, typical of the Papaveraceae family. The plant has smooth, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it is also valued for its historical and potential medicinal uses."
