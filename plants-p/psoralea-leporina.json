It is a low-growing annual herb with small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, branched stems and produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Psoralea leporina thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
