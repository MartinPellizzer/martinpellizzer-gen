    "intro": "Pycreus potosiensis, commonly known as the Potosi orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of Bolivia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
