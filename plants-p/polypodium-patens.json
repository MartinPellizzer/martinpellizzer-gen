    "intro": "Polypodium patens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. Polypodium patens is well adapted to grow on rocks or trees, where it can absorb moisture from the air."
