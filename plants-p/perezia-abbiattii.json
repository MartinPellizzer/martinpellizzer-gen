    "intro": "Perezia abbiattii, commonly known as the Abbiatti's perezia, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and a single, showy inflorescence that bears several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
