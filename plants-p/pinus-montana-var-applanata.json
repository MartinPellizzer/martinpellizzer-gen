    "intro": "Pinus montana var. applanata, commonly known as the flat-topped pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive flat or rounded crown, which sets it apart from other pine species. The leaves, or needles, are typically longer and more slender compared to other pine varieties. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for a long time. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
