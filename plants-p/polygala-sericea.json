    "intro": "Polygala sericea, commonly known as silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Polygala sericea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
