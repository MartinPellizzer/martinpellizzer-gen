It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The species produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and attract pollinators."
