    "intro": "Psychotria agusanensis, commonly known as the Agusan psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Mindanao, where it grows in lowland to montane rainforests. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It is often found in shaded, humid environments and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
