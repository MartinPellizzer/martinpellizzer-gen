    "intro": "Pomasterion, commonly known as the Mediterranean hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Pomasterion is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
