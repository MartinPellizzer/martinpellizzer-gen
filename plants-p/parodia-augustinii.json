It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors."
