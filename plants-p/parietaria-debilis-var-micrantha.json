    "intro": "Parietaria debilis var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant features small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Its reproductive strategy relies on wind pollination, and it is often found growing in close proximity to other moisture-loving plants. The species is characterized by its ability to adapt to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained, loamy soils."
