    "intro": "Poa tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to southern South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in high-altitude regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Poa tortuosa is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats and plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
