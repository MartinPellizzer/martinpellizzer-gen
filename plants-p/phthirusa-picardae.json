It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and produces small, berry-like fruits that are often edible. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinct, somewhat prickly texture. Phthirusa picardae is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
