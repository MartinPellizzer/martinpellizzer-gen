    "intro": "Prasophyllum macrostachyum var. ringens, commonly known as the Ringed Leek Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of pale green to brownish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
