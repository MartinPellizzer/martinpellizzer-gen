    "intro": "Polygonum pachyrhizum, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it an aggressive invader in wetland and riparian habitats. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
