    "intro": "Primula lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features erect, hairy stems that bear clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers cool, moist environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
