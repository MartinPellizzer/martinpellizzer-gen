    "intro": "Pancratium maximum, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in coastal and sandy environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Pancratium maximum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional uses in medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
