    "intro": "Pisonia cacerensis, commonly known as the Caceres's pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically the island of Cura\u00e7ao. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Pisonia cacerensis plays an important ecological role in its native environment, contributing to biodiversity and providing food and shelter for local wildlife."
