    "intro": "Pseudotsuga mucronata var. suberosa, commonly known as the suberous hemlock, is a variant of the hemlock tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and conical shape, with needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly twisted. The tree produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain winged seeds, aiding in its reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. This variety is notable for its slow growth and longevity, sometimes living over 500 years."
