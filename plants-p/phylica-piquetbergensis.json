    "intro": "Phylica piquetbergensis, commonly known as the Piquetberg flamebrush, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, flame-colored inflorescences that bloom in late spring, adding a vibrant splash of red to the landscape. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and is also used in traditional medicine."
