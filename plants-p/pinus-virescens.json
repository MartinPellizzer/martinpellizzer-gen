    "intro": "Pinus virescens, commonly known as the eastern white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that grow in clusters of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming thicker and more furrowed with age. The plant plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
