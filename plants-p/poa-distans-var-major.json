    "intro": "Poa distans var. major, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a variant of the Poa distans species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both spikelets and florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often forming dense stands. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological studies and habitat restoration efforts."
