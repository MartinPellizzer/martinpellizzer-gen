    "intro": "Polystichum braunii, commonly known as Braun's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium. Polystichum braunii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
