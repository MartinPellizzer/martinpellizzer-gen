    "intro": "Plagiogyria urbani, commonly known as the urban lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in urban environments. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, enabling it to survive in harsh, polluted conditions. It is often found on bark, stones, and walls in cities, making it an indicator species for air quality. Its ability to tolerate high levels of pollution makes it a common sight in urban landscapes."
