    "intro": "Piptatherum exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and disturbed ground. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
