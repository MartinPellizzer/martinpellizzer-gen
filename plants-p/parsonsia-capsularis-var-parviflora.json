It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features opposite, simple, and usually lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are typically clustered in umbels. The fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the family. It is often found in coastal and sandy soils, adapting well to saline environments."
