    "intro": "Pluchea monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical herbaceous growth habit. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with rough or hairy surfaces, and its small yellow flowers are arranged in a single head at the tip of each stem. Pluchea monocephala is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
