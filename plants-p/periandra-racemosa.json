    "intro": "Periandra racemosa, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 cm. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Periandra racemosa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found growing on rocky soils."
