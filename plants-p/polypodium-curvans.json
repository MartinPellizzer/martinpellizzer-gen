    "intro": "Polypodium curvans, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that form a zigzag pattern. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Polypodium curvans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests and tropical rainforests."
