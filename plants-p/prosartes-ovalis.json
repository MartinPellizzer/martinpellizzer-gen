    "intro": "Prosartes ovalis, commonly known as the oval leaf barren-ground grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and sandy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. Prosartes ovalis is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
