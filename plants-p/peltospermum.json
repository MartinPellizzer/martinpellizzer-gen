    "intro": "Peltospermum, commonly known as the \"spear-fruit,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Peltospermataceae. These plants are characterized by their unique seed structure, which includes a hard, woody outer covering that protects the embryo. Peltospermum species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a broad or ovate shape. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
