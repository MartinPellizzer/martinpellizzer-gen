It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
