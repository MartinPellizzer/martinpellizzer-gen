    "intro": "Plantago media var. monnieri, commonly known as narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, meadows, and wetlands. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in various soil types, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its healing properties. The plant is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
