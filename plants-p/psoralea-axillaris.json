It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the leaf axils. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Psoralea axillaris is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
