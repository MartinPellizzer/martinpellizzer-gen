    "intro": "Primula sonchifolia var. atrocoerulea, commonly known as the dark blue primrose, is a rare and striking variant of the primula genus. It is characterized by its deep, almost indigo-blue petals that contrast sharply with its pale yellow centers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs, enhancing its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
