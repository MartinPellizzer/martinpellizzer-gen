    "intro": "Phacelurus schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's phacelurus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
