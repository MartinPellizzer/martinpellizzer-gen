    "intro": "Pithecellobium trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaf acacia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping and soil improvement."
