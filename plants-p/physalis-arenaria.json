    "intro": "Physalis arenaria, commonly known as the sand apple or desert tomatillo, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, including parts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits enclosed in a papery calyx, which turn orange-red when ripe. Its leaves are typically hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant is often found growing in sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
