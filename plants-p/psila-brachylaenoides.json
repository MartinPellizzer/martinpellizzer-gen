    "intro": "Psila brachylaenoides, commonly known as the coastal lantana, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
