    "intro": "Ptilimnium nodosum, commonly known as the nodding ptilimnium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Ptilimnium nodosum is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
