    "intro": "Phlegmariurus espinosanus, commonly known as the Spiny Clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Phlegmariurus espinosanus is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its historical significance in paleobotanical studies."
