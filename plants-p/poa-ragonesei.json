    "intro": "Poa ragonesei, commonly known as Ragonese's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the island of Sicily and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and usually have a bluish-green hue, which helps it thrive in its native environment. Poa ragonesei is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
