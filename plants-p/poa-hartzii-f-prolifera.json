    "intro": "Poa hartzii f. prolifera, commonly known as the spreading meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to the western United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth pattern. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
