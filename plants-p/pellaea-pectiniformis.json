    "intro": "Pellaea pectiniformis, commonly known as the spoon fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spoon-shaped fronds that are often curled and have a unique, almost prehensile appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and ecological studies."
