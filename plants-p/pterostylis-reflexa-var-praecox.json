It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that resemble a helmet, with a distinctive reflexed lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its roots are fibrous, and it produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves. The species is notable for its early flowering period, often blooming in late winter or early spring."
