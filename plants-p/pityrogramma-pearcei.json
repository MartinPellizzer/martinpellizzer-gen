    "intro": "Pityrogramma pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in nutrient absorption. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that contribute to its overall ornamental appearance."
