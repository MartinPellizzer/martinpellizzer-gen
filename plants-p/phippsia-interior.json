    "intro": "Phippsia interior, commonly known as the interior phippsia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phippsia interior is considered a species of conservation concern."
