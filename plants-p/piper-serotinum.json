    "intro": "Piper serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom late in the growing season, hence its common name. Its leaves are ovate with a glossy surface and emit a mild peppery aroma. The fruit is a small, elongated berry that turns red when mature, often used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some regions."
