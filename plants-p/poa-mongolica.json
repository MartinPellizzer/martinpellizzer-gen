    "intro": "Poa mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Poa mongolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
