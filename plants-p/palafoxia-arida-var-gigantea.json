    "intro": "Palafoxia arida var. gigantea, commonly known as the desert bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing remarkable drought tolerance due to its deep root system. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife."
