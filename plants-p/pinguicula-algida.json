    "intro": "Pinguicula algida, commonly known as the alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, with a single pistil and stamens that are adapted for insect pollination. Pinguicula algida is a perennial herb that plays a unique role in nutrient-poor ecosystems by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
