    "intro": "Pterocaulon tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly pterocaulon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically small and often shed during dry periods, allowing the stems to store water. Pterocaulon tomentosus is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water once established."
