It is a small, mat-forming perennial with compact, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
