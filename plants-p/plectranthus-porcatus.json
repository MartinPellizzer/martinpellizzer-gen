    "intro": "Plectranthus porcatus, commonly known as the fat-leaf plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
