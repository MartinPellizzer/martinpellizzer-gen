    "intro": "Peperomia hirtipetiola, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are borne on short, upright spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia hirtipetiola is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
