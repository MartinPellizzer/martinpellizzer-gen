    "intro": "Poa deylii f. subgranitica, commonly known as the granitic meadowgrass, is a horticultural form of Poa deylii, a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This variety is characterized by its dense, fine-textured foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained, gritty soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, adding a delicate ornamental quality. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is a valued addition to drought-tolerant and low-maintenance gardens."
