    "intro": "Passerina tarton-raira, commonly known as the Tarton-Raira Passerine, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and vibrant blue-violet petals that reflect its adaptation to cold, sunny environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that minimize water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich structure. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Passerina tarton-raira is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
