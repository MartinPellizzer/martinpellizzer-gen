    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. radiata, commonly known as the radiata pine, is a variant of the serotinous pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of two, and its distinctive cone structure. The tree produces cones that remain closed until triggered by fire or extreme heat, a trait known as serotiny. Radiata pine is valued for its rapid growth and strong, durable wood, making it an important species in forestry. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, rocky environments where it thrives."
