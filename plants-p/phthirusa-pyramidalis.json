    "intro": "Phthirusa pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a dense, leaf-like structure with a greenish or yellowish coloration due to its symbiotic algae. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its thallus for nutrient absorption. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a notable species in ecological studies."
