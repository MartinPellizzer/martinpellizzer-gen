It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a hand with fingers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are followed by blue-black berries. Pinellia pedatisecta thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
