It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Penstemon globosus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
