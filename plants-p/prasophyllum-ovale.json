    "intro": "Prasophyllum ovale, commonly known as the oval leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often on sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a few narrow, grass-like leaves and a single spike of pale green to white flowers. Its flowers are relatively small and lack the showy petals typical of many orchids, instead featuring a more subdued, utilitarian appearance. Prasophyllum ovale is a short-lived perennial, with its life cycle closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns."
