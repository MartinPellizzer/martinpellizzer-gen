    "intro": "Polygala columbica, commonly known as the Columbian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with distinctive spurred petals. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Polygala columbica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral structure."
