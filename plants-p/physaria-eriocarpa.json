    "intro": "Physaria eriocarpa, commonly known as the sticky bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough, sticky texture. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by inflated, seed-containing pods. Physaria eriocarpa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
