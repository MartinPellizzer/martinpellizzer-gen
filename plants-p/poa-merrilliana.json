    "intro": "Poa merrilliana, commonly known as the Hainan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Hainan in China. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Poa merrilliana is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
