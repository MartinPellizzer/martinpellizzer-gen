    "intro": "Pittosporum \u00d7 obcordatum, commonly known as the silver bottlebrush, is a hybrid shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bottlebrush-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in coastal landscapes where it can tolerate salt spray."
