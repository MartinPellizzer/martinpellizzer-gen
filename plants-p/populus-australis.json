    "intro": "Populus australis, commonly known as the river poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread along riverbanks and wetlands. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Populus australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
