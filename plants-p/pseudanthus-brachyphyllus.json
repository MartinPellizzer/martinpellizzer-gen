    "intro": "Pseudanthus brachyphyllus, commonly known as the compact false sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered flowers that resemble a single bloom, a trait known as pseudanthery. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its compact size and vibrant blooms."
