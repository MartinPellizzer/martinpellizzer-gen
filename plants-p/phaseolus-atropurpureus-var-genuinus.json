    "intro": "Phaseolus atropurpureus var. genuinus, commonly known as the purple hull cowpea, is a legume native to the Americas. It is characterized by its indeterminate growth habit and trifoliate leaves with purple veins. The pods are typically green, turning brown as they mature, and contain angular, yellow to brown seeds. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It is widely cultivated in the southern United States for both fresh and dried use."
