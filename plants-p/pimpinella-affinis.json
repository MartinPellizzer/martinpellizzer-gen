    "intro": "Pimpinella affinis, commonly known as cow parsley or wild carrot, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that form umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges across temperate regions. Its seeds are small and winged, aiding in wind dispersal, while its roots contain compounds used in traditional medicine. Pimpinella affinis is also a valuable plant for pollinators, providing nectar and pollen to bees and other insects."
