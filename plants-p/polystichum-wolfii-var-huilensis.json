    "intro": "Polystichum wolfii var. huilensis, commonly known as the Huil\u00e9n shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and extensively branched, supporting the growth of its dense, shield-shaped foliage. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
