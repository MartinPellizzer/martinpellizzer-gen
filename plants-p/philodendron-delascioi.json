    "intro": "Philodendron delascioi, commonly known as the Delascioi philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
