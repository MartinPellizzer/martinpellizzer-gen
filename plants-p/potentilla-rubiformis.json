    "intro": "Potentilla rubiformis, commonly known as the red-leaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant's leaves are typically oval or elliptical, with a rough, slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Potentilla rubiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
