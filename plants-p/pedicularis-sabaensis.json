    "intro": "Pedicularis sabaensis, commonly known as the Saba beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in Ecuador. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it relies on a network of mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Pedicularis sabaensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
