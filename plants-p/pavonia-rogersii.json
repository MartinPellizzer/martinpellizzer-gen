    "intro": "Pavonia rogersii, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features dense clusters of small, bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Pavonia rogersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water landscapes."
