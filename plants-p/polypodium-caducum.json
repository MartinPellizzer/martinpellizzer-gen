    "intro": "Polypodium caducum, commonly known as the shedding fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, deciduous fronds that turn brown and fall off during the dry season. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, anchoring the plant to its substrate. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
