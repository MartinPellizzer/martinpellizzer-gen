    "intro": "Pithecellobium hymenaeifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often silver or gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some use in traditional medicine."
