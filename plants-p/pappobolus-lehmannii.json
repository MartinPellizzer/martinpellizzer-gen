    "intro": "Pappobolus lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's burrgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairless stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is known for its distinctive, wind-dispersed seeds that are encased in a bristly pappus. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
