    "intro": "Phyllanthus robustus, commonly known as the stonebreaker or Indian starfruit, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its botanical features include a woody stem, stipulate leaves, and a unique fruit structure that aids in seed dispersal. Phyllanthus robustus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in some regions for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
