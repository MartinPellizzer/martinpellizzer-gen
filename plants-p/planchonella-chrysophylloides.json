It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, golden-colored bloom, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove or brackish water habitats. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
