    "intro": "Platystele jesupiorum, commonly known as the Jesup's platter-leaf, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its unique, flat, disc-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and conservationists."
