    "intro": "Prunus incisa f. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine, white pubescence that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, often white or pale pink, which are followed by small, red or black berries in autumn. It is native to Japan and thrives in partial shade to full sun, preferring well-drained, acidic soil. This cultivar is valued for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
