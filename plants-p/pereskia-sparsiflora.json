    "intro": "Pereskia sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny structures, and it has a unique ability to store water in its stems. Pereskia sparsiflora is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories."
