    "intro": "Pinanga isabelensis, commonly known as the Isabel palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Luzon, where it grows in humid, lowland forest environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Pinanga isabelensis is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
