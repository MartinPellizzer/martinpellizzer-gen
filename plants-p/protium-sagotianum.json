    "intro": "Protium sagotianum, commonly known as the Sagotian wild pear, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by yellowish fruits that resemble small pears. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a sticky resin, which is a common trait among members of the Sapotaceae family. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
