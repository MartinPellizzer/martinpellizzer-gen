    "intro": "Perymenium croceum, commonly known as the golden perymenium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Perymenium croceum is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
