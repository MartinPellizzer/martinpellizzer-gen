    "intro": "Peplidium, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat preferences, and they possess specialized structures called bladders for trapping small aquatic organisms. Peplidium species are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. They are carnivorous, using their bladders to capture and digest prey, which supplements their nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments. The genus includes several species, such as Peplidium filicifolium, which is native to regions of Europe and Asia."
