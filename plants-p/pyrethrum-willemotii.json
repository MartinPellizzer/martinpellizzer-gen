    "intro": "Pyrethrum willemotii, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrins, which are used in organic insecticides. Pyrethrum willemotii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and horticultural use."
