    "intro": "Physocarpum, commonly known as the bladdernut or red bladderpod, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive seed pods that resemble bladders, which are inflated and often brightly colored. Native to various regions of the Americas, Physocarpum species typically grow in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are usually compound, and the flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Many species are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance."
