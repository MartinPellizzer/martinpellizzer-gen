    "intro": "Prometheum chrysanthum subsp. uludaghense, commonly known as the Uludag chrysanthemum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Uludag Mountains in Turkey. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
