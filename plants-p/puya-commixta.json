    "intro": "Puya commixta, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect rainwater in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Puya commixta is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions."
