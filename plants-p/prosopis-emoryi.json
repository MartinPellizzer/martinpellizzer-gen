    "intro": "Prosopis emoryi, commonly known as the Emory acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, narrow pods that contain edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Prosopis emoryi is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
