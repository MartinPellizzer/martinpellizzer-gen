    "intro": "Pilea rhombifolia, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, green fruit resembling small coins. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Pilea rhombifolia is relatively low maintenance and adds a charming, foliage-focused aesthetic to any space."
