    "intro": "Portulacaria pygmaea, commonly known as the elephant's food or baby's tears, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months. The plant is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
