    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. quassandum, commonly known as the Himalayan poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its striking red petals and dark green foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces capsule-like seed pods that contain latex, which can be processed to extract alkaloids such as morphine and codeine. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to the landscape. Due to its botanical and medicinal significance, it is both a subject of scientific study and a plant of regulatory interest."
