    "intro": "Psoralea tamborensis, commonly known as the Tamborensis Psoralea, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, and its trifoliate leaves. It is often found in rocky soils and can withstand periods of drought due to its deep root system. Psoralea tamborensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
