    "intro": "Psanchum, commonly known as the common thornapple, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, disturbed habitats. The plant features spiny stems and leaves, with showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruits are round, green berries that turn yellow or red when ripe, containing toxic seeds. Psanchum is valued in traditional medicine but requires caution due to its poisonous properties."
