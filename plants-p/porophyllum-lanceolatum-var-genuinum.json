    "intro": "Porophyllum lanceolatum var. genuinum, commonly known as the Mexican fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the spring and summer, producing yellow to orange composite blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
