    "intro": "Petrosedum rupestre subsp. reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
