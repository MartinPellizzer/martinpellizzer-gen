    "intro": "Pyrus pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet, featuring gray-barked branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sour apples that mature in the fall. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ornamental gardening and ecological habitats."
