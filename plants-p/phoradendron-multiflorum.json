    "intro": "Phoradendron multiflorum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in both ecological interactions and traditional medicine."
