    "intro": "Pteris polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris polyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
