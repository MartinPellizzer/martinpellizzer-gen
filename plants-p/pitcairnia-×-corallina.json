    "intro": "Pitcairnia \u00d7 corallina, commonly known as the coral pitcairnia, is a hybrid bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, coral-like inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, vibrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow, evergreen leaves that form a rosette shape, capable of collecting rainwater. Pitcairnia \u00d7 corallina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
