    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori on the underside. The fronds are typically broad and have a slightly curled appearance, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
