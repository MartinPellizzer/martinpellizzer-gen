It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds with short petioles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a versatile choice for humid climates."
