    "intro": "Ptychopyxis caput-medusae, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or Medusa's head, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded stem with dense clusters of fleshy, spiny leaves that give it a unique, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged foliage. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it drought-tolerant. The species is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and architectural form."
