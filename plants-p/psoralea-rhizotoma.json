    "intro": "Psoralea rhizotoma, commonly known as the hairy psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its root system is adapted to survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are not extensively studied."
