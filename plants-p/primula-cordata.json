    "intro": "Primula cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It blooms in early spring, making it a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators. Primula cordata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care."
