    "intro": "Piper corcovadense var. sessifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf pepper plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and attach directly to the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible but have a mild, peppery flavor. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses. Its botanical structure supports its role in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
