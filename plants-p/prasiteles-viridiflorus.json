    "intro": "Prasiteles viridiflorus, commonly known as the emerald-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to efficiently capture moisture from the humid environment. Prasiteles viridiflorus thrives in shaded, moist conditions and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. It is often found growing on the forest floor or as an epiphyte on the trunks of trees."
