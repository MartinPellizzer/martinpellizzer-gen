It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Palala iners is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it both a nuisance in cultivated areas and a subject of study in ecological research."
