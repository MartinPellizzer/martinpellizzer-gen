    "intro": "Pellaea subsimplex, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Pellaea subsimplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
