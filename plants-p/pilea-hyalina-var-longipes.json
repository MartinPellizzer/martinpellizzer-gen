It is native to China and is characterized by its striking, translucent leaves that give it its common name. The plant features slender, upright stems with a rosette of elongated, waxy leaves that can grow up to 10 inches in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in a spadix surrounded by a green spathe. This variety is prized for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
