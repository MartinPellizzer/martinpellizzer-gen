    "intro": "Piptatherum aequiglume, commonly known as the flat-lemma grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Its inflorescence is a compact cluster of spikelets, which are often arranged in a loose panicle. The species is characterized by its flat, glabrous lemmas and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
