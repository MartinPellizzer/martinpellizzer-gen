    "intro": "Pilosella megalomastix, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex-like sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among plants in the Asteraceae family. Pilosella megalomastix thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
