    "intro": "Potentilla ranunculus, commonly known as the meadow cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately divided into five to seven lobes, and it produces small, fluffy seed heads that disperse easily. Potentilla ranunculus is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
