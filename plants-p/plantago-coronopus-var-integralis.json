    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. integralis, commonly known as the common plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks rising from the leaf rosette. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
