    "intro": "Pteris auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of an ear, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Pteris auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
