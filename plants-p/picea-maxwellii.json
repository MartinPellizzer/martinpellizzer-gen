    "intro": "Picea maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's spruce, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark blue-green needles that are typically 10\u201315 mm long. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
