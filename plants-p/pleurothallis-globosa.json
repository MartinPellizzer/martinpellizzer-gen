    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis globosa, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its roots are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that helps it absorb moisture from the air. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
