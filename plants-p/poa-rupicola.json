It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including high altitude and low nutrient availability. Poa rupicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
