    "intro": "Pogogyne douglasii var. tricolor, commonly known as the tricolored pogogyne, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often tinged with green or purple, giving it its tricolor appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
