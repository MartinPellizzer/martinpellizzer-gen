    "intro": "Primula lofthousei, commonly known as the Lofthouse's primrose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and vibrant, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically features broad, ovate leaves that are softly hairy, and its flowers can be white, pink, or purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
