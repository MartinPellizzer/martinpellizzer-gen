    "intro": "Polystichum auriculatum var. subpinnatum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the auriculatum species within the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow to bronze-colored fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving them a metallic sheen. The fronds are typically arched and have a sub-pinnate structure, with pinnae that are lanceolate and gradually narrowing towards the tips. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across temperate regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
