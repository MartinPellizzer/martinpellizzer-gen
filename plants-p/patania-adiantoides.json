    "intro": "Patania adiantoides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fern, though it lacks true fern-like spores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps to reflect excess light and reduce water loss. Patania adiantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
