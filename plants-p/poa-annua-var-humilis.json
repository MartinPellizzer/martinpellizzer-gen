    "intro": "Poa annua var. humilis, commonly known as the common annual bluegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with blue-green leaves that are often mistaken for true bluegrass. It is an annual species, completing its life cycle within a single growing season. Due to its adaptability, it is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas."
