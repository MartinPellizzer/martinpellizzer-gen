    "intro": "Phenax pentandrus, commonly known as the five-stamen orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring five stamens that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on the forest floor or as an epiphyte on trees. Its flowers are small but striking, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
