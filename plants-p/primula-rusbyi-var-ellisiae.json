    "intro": "Primula rusbyi var. ellisiae, commonly known as the Ellisia primrose, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, cup-shaped flowers that range from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, wavy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
