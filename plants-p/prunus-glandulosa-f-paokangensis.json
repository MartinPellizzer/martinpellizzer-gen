    "intro": "Prunus glandulosa f. paokangensis, commonly known as the Paokang cherry, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Prunus glandulosa species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically narrow and serrated. The plant produces small, sweet-tasting fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife and humans in certain regions. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous areas of southwestern China. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is considered an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
