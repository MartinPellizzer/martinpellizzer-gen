    "intro": "Pleiocardia breweri, commonly known as the Hawaiian pleiocardia, is a rare endemic plant species found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are generally narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Pleiocardia breweri is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
