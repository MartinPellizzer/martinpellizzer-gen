    "intro": "Pteris viridissima, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble a lacy pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia that release spores for propagation. Pteris viridissima is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying properties."
