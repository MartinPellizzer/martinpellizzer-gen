    "intro": "Pteris tremula var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features wiry, dark green fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and marshes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
