    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense spike of pale green to white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as tundra and heathlands. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a sensitive indicator of environmental change."
