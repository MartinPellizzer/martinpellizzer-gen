    "intro": "Pleurothallis frutex var. robusta, commonly known as the robust tree orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This species is characterized by its erect, woody stems and compact, clustered inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are usually\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem, contributing to its structural resilience. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds."
