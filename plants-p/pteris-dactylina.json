    "intro": "Pteris dactylina, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a dense, umbrella-like structure. The plant has a thick, leathery rhizome that anchors it to surfaces such as trees or rocks. Its fronds are typically dark green with a waxy texture and can grow up to several feet in length. Pteris dactylina is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments."
