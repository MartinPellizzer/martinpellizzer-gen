It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments within the canopy of rainforests. The plant produces delicate, elongated flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in small inflorescences. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
