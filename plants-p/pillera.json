    "intro": "Pillera, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Pillera species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
