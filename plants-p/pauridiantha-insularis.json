It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, showing a high degree of adaptation to arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
