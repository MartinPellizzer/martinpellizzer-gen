    "intro": "Polystichum wawranum, commonly known as the Wawran holly fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum wawranum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
