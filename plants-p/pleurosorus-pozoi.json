It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive purple hue on the underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pleurosorus pozoi is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
