    "intro": "Pentadesma grandifolia, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its valuable timber and ornamental qualities, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
