    "intro": "Pilosella hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, with hairy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pilosella hohenackeri is considered a rare and specialized species."
