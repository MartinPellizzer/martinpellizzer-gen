    "intro": "Philotria occidentalis, commonly known as the western philotria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often along rocky soils or in desert scrub habitats. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Philotria occidentalis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
