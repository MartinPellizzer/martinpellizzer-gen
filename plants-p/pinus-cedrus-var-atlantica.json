    "intro": "Pinus cedrus var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a subspecies of the cedar tree native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It is a tall, coniferous evergreen with a straight trunk and a conical crown, featuring needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is dense and durable, historically valued for construction and furniture. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region."
