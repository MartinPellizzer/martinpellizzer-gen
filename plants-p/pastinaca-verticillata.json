It features a robust, taproot system and thick, rough-textured stems that often branch at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiny, lobed seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its medicinal and historical uses."
