    "intro": "Polycodium sericeum var. eburneum, commonly known as silver thread or silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems covered in fine, silky white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Polycodium sericeum var. eburneum is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
