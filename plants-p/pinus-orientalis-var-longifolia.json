    "intro": "Pinus orientalis var. longifolia, commonly known as the Longleaf pine, is a variant of the Oriental pine native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically bundled in groups of two. The tree can grow to significant heights, often reaching over 30 meters, with a broad, open crown. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought. This species is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments."
