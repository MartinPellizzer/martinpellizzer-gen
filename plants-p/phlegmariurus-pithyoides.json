    "intro": "Phlegmariurus pithyoides, commonly known as the yellow moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a short, creeping stem with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled when dry. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. This moss is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
