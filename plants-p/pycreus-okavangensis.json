The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near water sources, thriving in the wetland ecosystems of the Okavango Delta. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
