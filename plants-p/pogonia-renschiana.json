    "intro": "Pogonia renschiana, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, showy pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, which are attracted to its nectar-filled pouch. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pogonia renschiana is considered endangered in many areas."
