    "intro": "Phaca pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf phaca, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Its botanical classification places it in the family Polygonaceae, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
