    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica var. longepilosa, commonly known as the long-haired cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, grayish-green leaves with long, soft hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
