    "intro": "Puya santanderensis, commonly known as the Santander grass or the Andean grass, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting various pollinators. It has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Puya santanderensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
