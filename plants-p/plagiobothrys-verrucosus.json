    "intro": "Plagiobothrys verrucosus, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences and are usually pink to purple in color. Plagiobothrys verrucosus is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
