    "intro": "Pedicularis atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood lousewort, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its vivid red-orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pedicularis atrosanguinea is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
