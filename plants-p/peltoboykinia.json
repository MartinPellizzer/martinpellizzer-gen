    "intro": "Peltoboykinia, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to regions of North America and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Peltoboykinia is adapted to thrive in dry conditions, making it a resilient species in semi-arid climates."
