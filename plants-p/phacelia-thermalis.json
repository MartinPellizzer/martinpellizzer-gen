    "intro": "Phacelia thermalis, commonly known as the thermal phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the western regions. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in areas with high temperatures, such as near geothermal springs. Its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves are adapted to its arid and thermally influenced habitat. Phacelia thermalis is an important species for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
