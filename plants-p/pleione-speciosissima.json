    "intro": "Pleione speciosissima, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in shaded, moist environments, and prefers cool, humid conditions. Its rhizome-based growth habit allows it to thrive in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly sought after in horticulture and conservation efforts."
