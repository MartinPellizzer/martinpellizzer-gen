    "intro": "Panicum bennettense, commonly known as Bennett's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences that are often pale green to golden in color. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife in wetland ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland health."
