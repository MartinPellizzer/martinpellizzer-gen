    "intro": "Pedicularis zeylanica, commonly known as the Sri Lankan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers typically display a range of colors, from pink to purple, and are often adorned with distinctive markings. Pedicularis zeylanica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of its native ecosystems."
