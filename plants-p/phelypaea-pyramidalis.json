    "intro": "Phelypaea pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped fronds that grow in a rosette formation. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats on the forest floor. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Phelypaea pyramidalis is often found in shaded, moist areas such as under trees or in shaded rock crevices."
