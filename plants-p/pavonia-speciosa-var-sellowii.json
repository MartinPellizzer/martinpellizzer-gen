It is characterized by its striking, showy pink to red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
