    "intro": "Pteris croesus, commonly known as the noble water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing leaves. Pteris croesus is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in tropical habitats."
