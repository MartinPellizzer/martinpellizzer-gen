    "intro": "Pedicularis gracilicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves are adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments. Pedicularis gracilicaulis is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it blooms from late spring to early summer."
