    "intro": "Pelecyphora chihuahuensis subsp. henricksonii, commonly known as the Chihuahua pelecyphora, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
