    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii f. globosa, commonly known as the globe Douglas fir, is a unique form of the Douglas fir characterized by its dense, spherical crown. It is a variant of the native western hemlock and is typically found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The plant has a slow growth rate and exhibits a compact, rounded shape due to its genetic variation. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dark green and tightly packed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This form is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
