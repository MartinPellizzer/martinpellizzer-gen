    "intro": "Polypodium aspidistrifrons, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its ornamental value makes it popular in horticulture. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
