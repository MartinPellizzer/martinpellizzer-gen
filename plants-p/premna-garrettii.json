It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
