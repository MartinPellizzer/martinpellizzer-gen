    "intro": "Podocarpus koordersii, commonly known as the Japanese yew or koorders' podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan and southern Korea. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and parks."
