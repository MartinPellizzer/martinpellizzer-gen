    "intro": "Puccinellia jeholensis, commonly known as Jehol grass, is a perennial grass species native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important species in arid and semi-arid regions. Puccinellia jeholensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions."
