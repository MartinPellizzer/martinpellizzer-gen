    "intro": "Potentilla dethomasii, commonly known as Dethomas' cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves composed of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
