    "intro": "Prunus rotundifolia, commonly known as the sour cherry or cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, tart red berries that are edible but often used in jams and liqueurs. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Prunus rotundifolia is also valued for its fragrant foliage and its ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions."
