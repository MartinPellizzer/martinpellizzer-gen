    "intro": "Pilea hirtella, commonly known as the velvet pilea, is a member of the Araceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it a unique texture. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with upright stems and broad, heart-shaped foliage. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden beneath the leaves, and are followed by bright red berries. Pilea hirtella is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
