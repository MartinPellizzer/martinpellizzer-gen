    "intro": "Phlegmariurus flagellaceus, commonly known as the flagellate clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. This clubmoss is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in specific ecological conditions."
