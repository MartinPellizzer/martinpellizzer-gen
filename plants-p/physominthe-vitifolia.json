    "intro": "Physominthe vitifolia, commonly known as the grapeleaf physominthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. Its fibrous roots are known for their ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Physominthe vitifolia is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
