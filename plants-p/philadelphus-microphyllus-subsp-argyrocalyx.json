    "intro": "Philadelphus microphyllus subsp. argyrocalyx, commonly known as the silver-leaf mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on the previous year's wood. Its growth habit is compact and upright, with a rounded form that makes it suitable for small garden spaces. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to a variety of soil types."
