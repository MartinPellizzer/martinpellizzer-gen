    "intro": "Polypodium scutifrons, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and often grows on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to its host. Polypodium scutifrons is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
