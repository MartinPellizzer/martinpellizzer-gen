    "intro": "Pleopeltis gomeziana, commonly known as the Gomez's rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. The plant has lanceolate to ovate leaves with a serrated margin, and its fronds are typically leathery and dark green. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
