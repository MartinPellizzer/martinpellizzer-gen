    "intro": "Pimelea sericostachya subsp. amabilis, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It typically grows in heathlands and open woodlands, often in association with eucalyptus trees. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
