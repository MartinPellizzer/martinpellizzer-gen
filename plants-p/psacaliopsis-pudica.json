    "intro": "Psacaliopsis pudica, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces slender, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Psacaliopsis pudica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
