    "intro": "Prunus spinosa proles ligerina, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the fruit. It thrives in poor soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though they are toxic when unripe."
