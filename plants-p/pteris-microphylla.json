    "intro": "Pteris microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is frequently cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
