    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris andringitrensis, commonly known as the Andes feather fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns in the genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its small size and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
