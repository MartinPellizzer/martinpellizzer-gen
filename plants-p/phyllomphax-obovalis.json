    "intro": "Phyllomphax obovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaf phyllomphax, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific ecological niches. It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often near the base of the stems. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a tendency to form low, sprawling mats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability and biodiversity."
