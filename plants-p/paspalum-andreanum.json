    "intro": "Paspalum andreanum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and periodic flooding. Paspalum andreanum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and resilience."
