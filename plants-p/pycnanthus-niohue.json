    "intro": "Pycnanthus niohue, commonly known as the Hawaiian pycnanthus, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded canopy and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
