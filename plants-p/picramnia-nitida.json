It is characterized by its striking white, flame-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly pubescent surface. Its flowers are fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
