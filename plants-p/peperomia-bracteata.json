    "intro": "Peperomia bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often dark green with a velvety texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 cm, making it ideal for container gardening or as a houseplant. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, with moderate watering to prevent root rot. Peperomia bracteata is known for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
