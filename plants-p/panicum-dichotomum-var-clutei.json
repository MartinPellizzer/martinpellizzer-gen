    "intro": "Panicum dichotomum var. clutei, commonly known as the Clute's bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of red or purple bristles. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
