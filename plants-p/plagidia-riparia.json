It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist soils along streams, rivers, and marshes, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Plagidia riparia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local biodiversity."
