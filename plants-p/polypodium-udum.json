    "intro": "Polypodium udum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it its common name, and it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, ovate leaves that are densely packed along the rhizome. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Polypodium udum is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
