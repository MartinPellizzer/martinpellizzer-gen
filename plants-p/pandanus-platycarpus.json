    "intro": "Pandanus platycarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense canopy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into woody, cylindrical fruits. Its fibrous leaves are often used for thatching and weaving in traditional crafts. Pandanus platycarpus thrives in coastal and wetland environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight."
