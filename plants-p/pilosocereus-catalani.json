    "intro": "Pilosocereus catalani, commonly known as the Catalonian cactus, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus characterized by its cylindrical stems and dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
