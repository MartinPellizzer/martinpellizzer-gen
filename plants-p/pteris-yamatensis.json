    "intro": "Pteris yamatensis, commonly known as the Yamat\u014d maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the substrate. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance."
