    "intro": "Polypodium malaccanum, commonly known as the Malacca spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are usually lanceolate or ovate, and they are often divided into segments. This fern is native to Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
