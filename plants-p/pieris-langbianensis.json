It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they remain green throughout the year. Pieris langbianensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
