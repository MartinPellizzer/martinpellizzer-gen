    "intro": "Pneumatopteris glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The glandular hairs on its leaves may play a role in water retention or defense against herbivores."
