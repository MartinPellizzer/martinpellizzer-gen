    "intro": "Polygonum minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf polygon or small-flowered knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, blooming from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Polygonum minutiflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insect species."
