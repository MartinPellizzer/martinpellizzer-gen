    "intro": "Przewalskia, commonly known as the Przewalski's horse, is actually a genus of flowering plants, not an animal. It consists of only two species, Przewalskia tangutica and Przewalskia sinensis, both native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. These plants are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and alternate leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Przewalskia species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
