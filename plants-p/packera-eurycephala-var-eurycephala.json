    "intro": "Packera eurycephala var. eurycephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fleabane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. The plant features basal leaves that are elongated and narrow, with a rough texture, and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear a cluster of small, daisy-like flowers. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to harsh alpine environments."
