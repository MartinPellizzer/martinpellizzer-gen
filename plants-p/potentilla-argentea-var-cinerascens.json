    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. cinerascens, commonly known as silver cineraria, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate cold climates and its long flowering period."
