    "intro": "Pogonia tetraphylla, commonly known as the purple twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and single, showy purple flower. The plant is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with specific tree species. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
