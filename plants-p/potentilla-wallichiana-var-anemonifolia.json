It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, giving it a resemblance to anemone species, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
