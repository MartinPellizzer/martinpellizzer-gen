    "intro": "Pilosella myosotidifolia, commonly known as the blue-eyed Mary, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate blue or violet flowers that resemble those of the forget-me-not. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"Pilosella,\" derived from the Greek word for \"hairy.\" It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in meadows and woodland edges. Pilosella myosotidifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens."
