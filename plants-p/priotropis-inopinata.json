    "intro": "Priotropis inopinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often gland-dotted, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its fruit is a three-chambered capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Priotropis inopinata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
