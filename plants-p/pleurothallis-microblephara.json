    "intro": "Pleurothallis microblephara, commonly known as the narrow-eyed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compact growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on trees. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, white to pale yellow blooms with a distinctive narrow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation."
