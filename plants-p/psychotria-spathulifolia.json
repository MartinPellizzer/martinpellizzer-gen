    "intro": "Psychotria spathulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded understories of forests. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by various bird species. Psychotria spathulifolia is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
