    "intro": "Pteris aquilina var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are smooth and glabrous, lacking the hairy texture found in other varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, green, spore-bearing fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
