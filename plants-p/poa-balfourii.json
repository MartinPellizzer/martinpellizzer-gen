    "intro": "Poa balfourii, commonly known as Balfour's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa balfourii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and low-maintenance nature."
