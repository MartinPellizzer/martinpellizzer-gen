    "intro": "Pseudobrachiaria deflexa, commonly known as the flexed false brachiaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and grassy habitats. Pseudobrachiaria deflexa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in ecological restoration projects."
