    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a low-growing, annual flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features succulent, fleshy leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
