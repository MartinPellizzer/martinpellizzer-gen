    "intro": "Pilea verrucosa subsp. subtriplinervia, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, velvety leaves with a waxy texture, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant has a short, upright stem with a dense cluster of leaves at the top, giving it a rounded appearance. Its leaves are typically dark green with a subtle reddish or purple tinge on the underside. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments."
