    "intro": "Pteris polypodioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris polypodioides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
