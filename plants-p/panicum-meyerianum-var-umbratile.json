    "intro": "Panicum meyerianum var. umbratile, commonly known as the shade panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, feathery flowers, typically in shades of brown or red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form attractive ground covers in shaded garden settings."
