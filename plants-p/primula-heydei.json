    "intro": "Primula heydei, commonly known as the Kamchatka primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of eastern Siberia. It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps to retain moisture. Primula heydei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
