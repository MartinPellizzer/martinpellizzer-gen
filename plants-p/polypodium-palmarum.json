    "intro": "Polypodium palmarum, commonly known as the palm fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a palm tree, with a central trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium palmarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
