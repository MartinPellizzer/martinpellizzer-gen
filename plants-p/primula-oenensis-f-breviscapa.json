    "intro": "Primula oenensis f. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed primrose, is a unique hybrid form of the primula genus native to the mountainous regions of China. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often pale or bluish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps it withstand colder temperatures. The plant thrives in well-drained, moist soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated by horticulturists for its aesthetic appeal."
