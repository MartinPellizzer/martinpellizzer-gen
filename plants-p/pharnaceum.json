    "intro": "Pharnaceum, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, or white. The plants are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Pharnaceum species have heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and their stems are often erect or trailing. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant flowers and adaptability to wet conditions."
