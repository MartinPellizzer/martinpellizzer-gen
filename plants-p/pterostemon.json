    "intro": "Pterostemon, commonly known as the \"whorled plectranthus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. These plants are characterized by their square stems, opposite leaves, and showy, tubular flowers that often come in shades of blue, purple, or white. Pterostemon species are native to Africa, particularly South Africa, and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them suitable for gardens and containers. Many species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
