    "intro": "Pinguicula magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant thrives in moist, boggy environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, often appearing in late summer. Pinguicula magellanica plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in its native habitat."
