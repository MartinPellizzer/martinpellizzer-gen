    "intro": "Pinus altamiranoi, commonly known as the Altamirano pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the tree for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
