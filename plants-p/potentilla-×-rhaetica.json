    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces showy, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping in colder climates."
