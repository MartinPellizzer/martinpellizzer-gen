    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas proles insignitum, commonly known as the scarlet poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its vibrant red flowers. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces striking, cup-shaped blooms that open in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are rich in petals and are often used in ornamental gardening due to their bold color. This variety is also notable for its historical use in the production of opium, though it is less potent than other poppy species."
