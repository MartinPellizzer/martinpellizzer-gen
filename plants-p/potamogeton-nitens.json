It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, which develop into small, spherical fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. Potamogeton nitens is often used in water quality assessments due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
