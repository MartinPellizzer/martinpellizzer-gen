    "intro": "Panicum maximiliani, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, feather-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, reddish-purple flowers that are often clustered in spikelets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its adaptability and drought tolerance contribute to its widespread use in landscaping and restoration projects."
