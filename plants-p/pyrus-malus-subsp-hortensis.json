    "intro": "Pyrus malus subsp. hortensis, commonly known as the domesticated apple, is a subspecies of the apple tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which develop into the familiar red, green, or yellow fruits. It is widely cultivated for its edible fruit, which is rich in vitamins and antioxidants. This subspecies is a key ancestor of many modern apple varieties used in agriculture."
