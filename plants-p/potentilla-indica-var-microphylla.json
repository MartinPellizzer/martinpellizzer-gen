    "intro": "Potentilla indica var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its compact form and vibrant blooms."
