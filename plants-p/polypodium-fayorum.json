    "intro": "Polypodium fayorum, commonly known as the African mountain fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually pinnate and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The botanical features of Polypodium fayorum make it an important species in the study of fern morphology and ecology."
