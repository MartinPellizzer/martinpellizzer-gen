    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum retroflexum, commonly known as the retroflex pincushion orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, compact growth habit and specialized root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, recurved lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
