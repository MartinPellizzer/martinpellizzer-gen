    "intro": "Populus hickeliana var. tremulifolia, commonly known as the trembling aspen, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, trembling leaves that shimmer in the wind, giving it its common name. The tree has a slender, often multi-stemmed trunk with smooth, gray bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras for seed dispersal. This species is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
