    "intro": "Panicum mayumbense, commonly known as Mayumbense grass, is a flowering plant species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
