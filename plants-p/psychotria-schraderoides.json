    "intro": "Psychotria schraderoides, commonly known as Schrader's psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, tubular flowers that are often greenish-white in color. It contains alkaloids, which have been of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological studies. Due to its habitat preferences and chemical composition, it is often found in understory layers of rainforests."
