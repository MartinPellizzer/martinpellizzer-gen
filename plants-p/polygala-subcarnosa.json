    "intro": "Polygala subcarnosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are characteristic of the Polygala genus. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates."
