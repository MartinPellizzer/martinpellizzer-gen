    "intro": "Parodia obtusa, commonly known as the Obtuse Parodia, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cactus collections."
