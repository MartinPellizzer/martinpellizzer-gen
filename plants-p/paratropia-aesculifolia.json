    "intro": "Paratropia aesculifolia, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble those of the horse chestnut, and its showy, white or pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces fruiting bodies called samaras, which contain seeds enclosed in a spiny husk. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine. Paratropia aesculifolia thrives in temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
