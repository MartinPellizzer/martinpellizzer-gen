    "intro": "Polypodium parietinum, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a small evergreen fern that thrives in rocky, shaded environments. It has a compact, creeping growth habit with rhizomes that anchor it to limestone or other rocky substrates. Its fronds are typically narrow and linear, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces spores in spherical clusters called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Polypodium parietinum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ability to colonize difficult terrain."
