    "intro": "Potentilla guilliermondii var. brachypetala, commonly known as the short-petaled potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
