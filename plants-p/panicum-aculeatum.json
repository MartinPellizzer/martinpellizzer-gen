    "intro": "Panicum aculeatum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, bristly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Botanically, it is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
