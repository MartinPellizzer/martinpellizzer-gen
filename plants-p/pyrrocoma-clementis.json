    "intro": "Pyrrocoma clementis, commonly known as the Clement's pyrrocoma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrrocoma clementis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
