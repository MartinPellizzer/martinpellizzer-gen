    "intro": "Pleopeltis lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pleopeltis lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
