    "intro": "Pleiosepalum mosambicinum, commonly known as the Mozambique orchid, is a tropical plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. The flowers are often white or pale pink, with a unique, spurred structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
