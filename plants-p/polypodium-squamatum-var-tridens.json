    "intro": "Polypodium squamatum var. tridens, commonly known as the toothed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
