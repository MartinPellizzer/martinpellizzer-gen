    "intro": "Physacanthus batanganus, commonly known as the Batangan mountain vine, is a climbing plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the forest floor and climb towards the canopy. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
