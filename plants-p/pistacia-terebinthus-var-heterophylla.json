    "intro": "Pistacia terebinthus var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Aleppo pine or Turkish turpentine tree, is a variant of the terebinth tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which includes both scale-like and foliage leaves, a feature that sets it apart from other Pistacia species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Its fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains a single seed. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in producing turpentine and other resins."
