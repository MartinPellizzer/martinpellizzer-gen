    "intro": "Piper huberi, commonly known as the mountain pepper plant, is a tropical shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many pepper species, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are commonly used to make tea, which is believed to have digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Piper huberi thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters."
