    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright branches with oval, glossy dark green leaves that have a pointed tip, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries in summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
