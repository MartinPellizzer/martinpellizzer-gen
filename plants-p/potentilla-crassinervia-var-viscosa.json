    "intro": "Potentilla crassinervia var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to regions of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, often sticky leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes. Its leaves are typically elliptical to ovate in shape, with prominent veins that are a distinguishing feature. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
