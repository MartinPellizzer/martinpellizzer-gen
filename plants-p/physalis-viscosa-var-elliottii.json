    "intro": "Physalis viscosa var. elliottii, commonly known as the sticky gooseberry, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-shaped fruits. The fruit's outer husk turns red to orange as it matures, and the edible, berry-like pulp is enclosed within a fleshy, papery covering. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
