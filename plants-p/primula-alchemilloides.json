    "intro": "Primula alchemilloides, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Primula alchemilloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine displays."
