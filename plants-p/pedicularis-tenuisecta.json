    "intro": "Pedicularis tenuisecta, commonly known as the slender-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
