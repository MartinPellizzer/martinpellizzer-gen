    "intro": "Parthenocissus quinquefolia f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Virginia creeper, is a variant of the Virginia creeper characterized by its hairy foliage. It is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America, featuring compound leaves with five leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its hairy texture distinguishes it from the more common smooth-leaved form of the species. This cultivar is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb walls and trellises."
