The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of pale green to white flowers, which are not particularly showy but contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. This variety is prized for its compact growth habit and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
