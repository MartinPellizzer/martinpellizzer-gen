    "intro": "Polypodium limapes, commonly known as the rock fern, is a tropical fern species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium limapes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
