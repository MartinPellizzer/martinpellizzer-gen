    "intro": "Pedicularis gracilituba var. typica, commonly known as the slender pipevine, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, pink to purple flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate and lanceolate, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain seeds. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is often found in specific regions of the Pacific Northwest."
