    "intro": "Pinus occidentalis subsp. baorucoensis, commonly known as the Baoruco pine, is a subspecies native to the island of Hispaniola. It is a tall evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves and cones that typically hang downward. The tree produces edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife and humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this subspecies is considered vulnerable to extinction."
