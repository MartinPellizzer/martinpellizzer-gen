It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Phleum rhaeticum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
