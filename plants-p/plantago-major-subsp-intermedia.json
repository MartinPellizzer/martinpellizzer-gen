    "intro": "Plantago major subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties. The leaves are commonly used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and healing benefits."
