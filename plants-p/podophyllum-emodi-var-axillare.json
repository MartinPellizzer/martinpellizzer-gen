    "intro": "Podophyllum emodi var. axillare, commonly known as the Himalayan mayapple, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects."
