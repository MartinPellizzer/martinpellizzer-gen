    "intro": "Pothos angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pothos, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of other pothos varieties. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pothos angustatus is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to purify the air."
