    "intro": "Potentilla hololeuca var. parviflora, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub with small, often hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The flowers are typically yellow or white, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, mountainous habitats."
