    "intro": "Primula macounii, commonly known as Macoun's primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features rosettes of oval, dark green, hairy leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, often with a yellow throat, during late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. Primula macounii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
