    "intro": "Pyrus neoantoninae, commonly known as the Neantonine pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are oval-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and white, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, edible fruits that are similar to common pears. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus neoantoninae is considered a rare and endangered species."
