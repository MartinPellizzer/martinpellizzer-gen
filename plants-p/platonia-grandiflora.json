    "intro": "Platonia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has a sturdy, spreading canopy with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its bark is rough and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. Platonia grandiflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and as a street tree in warm climates."
