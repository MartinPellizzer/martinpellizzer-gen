    "intro": "Phytolacca americana var. americana, commonly known as American pokeweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It features tall, erect stems that bear alternate, broad-ovate leaves with a waxy texture and a distinctive reddish midrib. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
