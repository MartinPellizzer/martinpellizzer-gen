    "intro": "Phedimus sichotensis, commonly known as the Sichuan phedimus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant features fleshy, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
