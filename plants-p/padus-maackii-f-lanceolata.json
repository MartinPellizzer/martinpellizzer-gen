    "intro": "Padus maackii f. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its fruits are small, woody drupes that mature to a dark red or black color. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
