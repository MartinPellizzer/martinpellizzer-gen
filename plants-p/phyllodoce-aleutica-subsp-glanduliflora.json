    "intro": "Phyllodoce aleutica subsp. glanduliflora, commonly known as the glandular mountain heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
