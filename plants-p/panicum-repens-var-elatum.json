    "intro": "Panicum repens var. elatum, commonly known as tall flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a flat, grass-like structure. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
