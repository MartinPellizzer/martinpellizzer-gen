    "intro": "Polypodium sundaicum, commonly known as the Sunda bedell's fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a bipinnate structure. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary lowland rainforests."
