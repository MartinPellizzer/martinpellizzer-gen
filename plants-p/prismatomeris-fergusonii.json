    "intro": "Prismatomeris fergusonii, commonly known as the Ferguson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often ghostly appearance, with elongated, thin stems and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant thrives in specific microhabitats, typically growing on decaying wood in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
