It features slender, arching leaves that can grow up to several meters in height, with a dense, tufted inflorescence at the top. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. The plant also plays a role in traditional medicine and livestock fodder in some regions."
