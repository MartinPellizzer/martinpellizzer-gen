    "intro": "Podostemum subulatum var. sholaii, commonly known as the Sholaii waterweed, is a rare aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South Asia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are adapted for life in fast-flowing freshwater environments. The plant typically grows along the edges of rivers and streams, anchoring itself to rocks with its specialized root system. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
