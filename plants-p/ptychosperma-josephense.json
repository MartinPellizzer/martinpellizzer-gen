    "intro": "Ptychosperma josephense, commonly known as the Joseph's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It is a dioecious species, meaning individual plants are either male or female. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ptychosperma josephense is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
