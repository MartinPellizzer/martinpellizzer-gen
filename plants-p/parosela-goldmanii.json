    "intro": "Parosela goldmanii, commonly known as the golden parosela, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela goldmanii is considered a species of conservation concern."
