    "intro": "Polypodium subdimidiatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in the understory of forests. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to both natural and cultivated settings."
