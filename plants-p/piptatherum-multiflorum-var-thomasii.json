    "intro": "Piptatherum multiflorum var. thomasii, commonly known as Thomas' bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense turf-like mats, making it a valuable groundcover. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
