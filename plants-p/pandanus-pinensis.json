    "intro": "Pandanus pinensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while its roots are sometimes used in local medicine. The species is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
