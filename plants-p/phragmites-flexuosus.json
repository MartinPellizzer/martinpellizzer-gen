    "intro": "Phragmites flexuosus, commonly known as the soft reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its flexible, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is often found in marshes, along lake shores, and in other moist habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands."
