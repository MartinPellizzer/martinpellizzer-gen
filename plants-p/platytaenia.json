    "intro": "Platytaenia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, allowing it to thrive in moist, disturbed soils. Platytaenia is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks in its native range."
