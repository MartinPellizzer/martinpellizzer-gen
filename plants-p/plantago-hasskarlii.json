    "intro": "Plantago hasskarlii, commonly known as the Karli's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the genus Plantago."
