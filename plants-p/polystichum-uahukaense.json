    "intro": "Polystichum uahukaense, commonly known as the Uahuka fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in compact, fertile groups. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
