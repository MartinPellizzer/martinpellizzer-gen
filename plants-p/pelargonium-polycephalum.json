    "intro": "Pelargonium polycephalum, commonly known as the African crane's-bill, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with multiple stems that bear clusters of small, rounded leaves. Its flowers are borne on long, erect stalks and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Pelargonium polycephalum is well-suited to Mediterranean climates and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
