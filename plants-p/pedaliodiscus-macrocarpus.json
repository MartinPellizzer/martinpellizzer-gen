    "intro": "Pedaliodiscus macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant discus, is a unique aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, round, and often colorful leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters with high light penetration and nutrient-rich substrates. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Pedaliodiscus macrocarpus is often cultivated in aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
