    "intro": "Platanthera klossii var. elatior, commonly known as the Kloss's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the highlands of New Guinea. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, spirally arranged flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, typically found in montane forests. It is noted for its delicate appearance and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Botanically, it belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is distinguished by its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
