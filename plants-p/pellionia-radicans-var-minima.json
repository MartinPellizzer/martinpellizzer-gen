    "intro": "Pellionia radicans var. minima, commonly known as the miniature creeping pellionia, is a low-growing, trailing plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers, which are not particularly showy but contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used as a ground cover in humid climates. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
