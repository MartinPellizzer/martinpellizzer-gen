    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum subsp. maximowicziana, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem and produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate markings. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
