    "intro": "Psilochenia occidentalis, commonly known as the western psilochenia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped inflorescences. This plant is native to western North America, particularly found in regions with moist, temperate climates. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The flowers are small and white, often clustered in umbrella-like structures, which attract various pollinators. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
