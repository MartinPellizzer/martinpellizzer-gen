It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for native garden landscapes."
