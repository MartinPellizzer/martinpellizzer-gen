    "intro": "Prenanthes altissima, commonly known as the tall water hemp, is a member of the Araceae family. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features a tall, slender stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Prenanthes altissima plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
