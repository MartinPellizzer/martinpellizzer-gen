    "intro": "Prenanthes pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf water plantain, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in nutrient-rich, poorly drained soils and is an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for wetland health."
