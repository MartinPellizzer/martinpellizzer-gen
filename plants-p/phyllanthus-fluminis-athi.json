    "intro": "Phyllanthus fluminis-athi, commonly known as the river phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, exhibiting a compact growth habit with dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and its potential medicinal properties."
