    "intro": "Pyrethrum palustre, commonly known as marsh pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in damp, marshy environments, thriving in poorly drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged conditions. Pyrethrum palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in natural pest control."
