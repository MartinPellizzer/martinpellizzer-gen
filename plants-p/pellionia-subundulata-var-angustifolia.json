It is characterized by its slender, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. This variety is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its delicate foliage and ease of care."
