    "intro": "Phragmipedium exstaminodium subsp. warszewiczii, commonly known as the Warszewicz's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive greenish throat. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with several blooms, each featuring intricate, spurred petals and a prominent lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
