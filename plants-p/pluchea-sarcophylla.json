It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months."
