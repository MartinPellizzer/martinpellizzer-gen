    "intro": "Ptarmica multifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Ptarmica multifida is known for its medicinal properties, particularly its use in traditional remedies for pain and inflammation."
