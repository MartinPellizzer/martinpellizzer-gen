    "intro": "Penstemon brachyanthus, commonly known as the showy penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces tall, spiky inflorescences with vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon brachyanthus is also adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
