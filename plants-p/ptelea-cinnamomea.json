    "intro": "Ptelea cinnamomea, commonly known as sweet fern, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves that emit a subtle cinnamon scent when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Sweet fern thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas."
