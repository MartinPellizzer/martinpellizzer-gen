    "intro": "Prunus recurviflora, commonly known as the recurved-flower cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically glabrous. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its flowers have a distinctive recurved shape, giving it its common name. Prunus recurviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
