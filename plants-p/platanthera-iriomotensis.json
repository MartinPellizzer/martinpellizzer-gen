    "intro": "Platanthera iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the island of Iriomote in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which contributes to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is critically threatened with extinction. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and delicate species."
