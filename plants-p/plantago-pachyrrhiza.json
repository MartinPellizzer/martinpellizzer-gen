    "intro": "Plantago pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-ribbed plantain, is a perennial herb native to the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a dense spike, which are clustered in inflorescences at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
