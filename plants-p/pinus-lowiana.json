    "intro": "Pinus lowiana, commonly known as the lowland pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Pinus lowiana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, acidic environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the forest ecosystems in its native range."
