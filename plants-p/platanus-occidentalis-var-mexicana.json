    "intro": "Platanus occidentalis var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sycamore, is a variant of the American sycamore native to central Mexico. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its large, rough bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a doubly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces distinctive, spherical clusters of small, greenish flowers in early spring. The tree is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and moist woodlands."
