    "intro": "Penstemon heterodoxus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Penstemon heterodoxus is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
