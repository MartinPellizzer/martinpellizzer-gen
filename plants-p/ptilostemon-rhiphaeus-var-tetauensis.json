    "intro": "Ptilostemon rhiphaeus var. tetauensis, commonly known as the Tetauensis ptilostemon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
