    "intro": "Pinus pattonii, commonly known as the Paton pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is a coniferous tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in fascicles of five, and it produces cones that are elongated and woody. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus pattonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
