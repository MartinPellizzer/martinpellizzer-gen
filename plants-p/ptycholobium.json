    "intro": "Ptycholobium, commonly known as the silky-oak, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of Australia and are characterized by their distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, yellow or golden flowers. Ptycholobium species are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, often featuring smooth, pale bark and compound leaves. They play an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Some species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
