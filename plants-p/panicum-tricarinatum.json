    "intro": "Panicum tricarinatum, commonly known as the three-ribbed panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a fibrous texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in shades of green to brown. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is used in some regions for forage or as a cover crop."
