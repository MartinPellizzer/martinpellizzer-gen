    "intro": "Periballia minuta subsp. baetica, commonly known as the Baetica dwarf periballia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
