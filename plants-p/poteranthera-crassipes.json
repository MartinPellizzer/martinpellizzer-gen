    "intro": "Poteranthera crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved poteranthera, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
