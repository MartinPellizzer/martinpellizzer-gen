    "intro": "Passerina nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Passerina nervosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
