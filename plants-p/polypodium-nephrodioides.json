    "intro": "Polypodium nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features fronds that are typically pinnately compound, with a distinctive kidney-shaped outline that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in shaded areas. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
