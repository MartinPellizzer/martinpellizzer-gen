    "intro": "Pedicularis galeobdolon, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
