It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, with a distinctive bilabiate structure, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
