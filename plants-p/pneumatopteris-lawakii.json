    "intro": "Pneumatopteris lawakii, commonly known as the Lawakii water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pneumatopteris lawakii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
