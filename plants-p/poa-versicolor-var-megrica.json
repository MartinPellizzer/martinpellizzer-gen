    "intro": "Poa versicolor var. megrica, commonly known as the variable bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are typical of the Poa genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. This variety is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of woodlands, where it contributes to the structural diversity of the vegetation."
