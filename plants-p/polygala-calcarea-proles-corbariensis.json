    "intro": "Polygala calcarea proles corbariensis, commonly known as the Corbariensian limestone milkvetch, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific limestone habitats in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and unique floral structure, which resembles that of other members of the Polygalaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or cliffside environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
