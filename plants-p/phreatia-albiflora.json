It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique sympodial growth habit. The plant produces large, showy white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland forests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for tropical rainforest ecosystems."
