    "intro": "Poa laxa var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges, preferring moist to mesic conditions. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
