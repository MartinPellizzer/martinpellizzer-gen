    "intro": "Persicaria amphibia f. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping smartweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pinkish-red petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are often submerged or partially submerged in water. This variety is well adapted to moist soils and can thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats."
