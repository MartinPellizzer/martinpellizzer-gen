It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
