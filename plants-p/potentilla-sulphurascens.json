    "intro": "Potentilla sulphurascens, commonly known as the sulfur-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and are clustered in groups of five, giving it the common name. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silky, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
