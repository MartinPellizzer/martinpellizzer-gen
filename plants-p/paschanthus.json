    "intro": "Paschanthus, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Paschanthus is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and seasonal beauty."
