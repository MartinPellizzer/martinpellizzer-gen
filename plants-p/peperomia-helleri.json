    "intro": "Peperomia helleri, commonly known as the Heller's peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to Central and South America. It features thick, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia helleri is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
