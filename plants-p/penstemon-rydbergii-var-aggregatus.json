    "intro": "Penstemon rydbergii var. aggregatus, commonly known as the Sierra penstemon, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
