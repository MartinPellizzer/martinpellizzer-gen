    "intro": "Potentilla brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems and alternate, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
