    "intro": "Peperomia cotyledon, commonly known as the \"Cotyledon Peperomia,\" is a compact, trailing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green with striking red or purple veins, adding visual interest to any indoor space. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, which are not the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and unique foliage, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a tabletop plant."
