It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically visited by native bees and other pollinators. The plant's fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that contains a single seed, and it is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments. Phymatodes billardierei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
