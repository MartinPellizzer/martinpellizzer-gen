    "intro": "Psittacoschoenus erythrocarpus, commonly known as the red-fruited flaxgrass, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its erect, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green flowers. Its distinctive feature is the bright red, fleshy berries that form after flowering, which are an important food source for native birds. This species is typically found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and riverbanks."
