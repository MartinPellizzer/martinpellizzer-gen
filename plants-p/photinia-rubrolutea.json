It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or orange berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking leaf color and relatively easy care requirements. Photinia rubrolutea prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
