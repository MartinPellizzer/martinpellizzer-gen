    "intro": "Peucedanum heterophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its structure and growth habit make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
