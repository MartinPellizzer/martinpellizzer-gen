    "intro": "Poterium creticum, commonly known as the Cretan thyme, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or violet flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its stems are typically prostrate, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Poterium creticum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
