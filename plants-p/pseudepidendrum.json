    "intro": "Pseudepidendrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of roots and its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to pale pink. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pseudepidendrum is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
