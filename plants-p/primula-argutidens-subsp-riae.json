    "intro": "Primula argutidens subsp. riae, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with serrated margins, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or purple flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
