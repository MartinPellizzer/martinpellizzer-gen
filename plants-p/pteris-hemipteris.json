    "intro": "Pteris hemipteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. Pteris hemipteris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
