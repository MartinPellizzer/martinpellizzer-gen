    "intro": "Polypodium tenuicauda, commonly known as the narrow-tailed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It features a slender, wiry rhizome with a distinctive, narrow tail-like appearance, from which the common name is derived. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a delicate, feathery structure that gives the plant a graceful appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. The plant's ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it well adapted to its natural habitat."
