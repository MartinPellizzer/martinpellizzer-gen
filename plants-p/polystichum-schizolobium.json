    "intro": "Polystichum schizolobium, commonly known as the split-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polystichum schizolobium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
