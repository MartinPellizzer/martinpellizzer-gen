    "intro": "Pectis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pectis angustifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
