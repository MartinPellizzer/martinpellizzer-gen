    "intro": "Pinalia maquilingensis, commonly known as the Maquiling pine, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its coniferous structure, featuring needle-like leaves and woody cones. The plant typically grows in montane forests at high elevations, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
