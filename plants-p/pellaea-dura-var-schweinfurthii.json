    "intro": "Pellaea dura var. schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's rock fern, is a hardy, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are densely packed. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and withstand harsh environmental conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
