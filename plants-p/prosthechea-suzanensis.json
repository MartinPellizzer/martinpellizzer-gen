    "intro": "Prosthechea suzanensis, commonly known as the Suzan's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with contrasting purple or red markings. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Prosthechea suzanensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
