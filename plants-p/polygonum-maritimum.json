It is characterized by its yellow-orange berries, which are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. The plant has woody stems that are often covered in a layer of resin, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Polygonum maritimum thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in coastal dunes and along shorelines."
