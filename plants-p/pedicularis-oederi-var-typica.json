It belongs to the family Oronoaceae and is characterized by its striking, pendulous yellow flowers that resemble small monkeys. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high altitudes where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are usually unbranched and bear the showy inflorescences. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
