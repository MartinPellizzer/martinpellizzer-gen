It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. It produces yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture."
