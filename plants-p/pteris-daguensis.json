    "intro": "Pteris daguensis, commonly known as the Daguensian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. This plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and often have a wavy or undulating appearance. Pteris daguensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor, making it a common sight in humid, low-light habitats."
