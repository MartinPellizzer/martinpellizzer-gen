    "intro": "Pedicularis adamsii, commonly known as the Adams' lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, vividly colored flowers that range from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in mountainous areas. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Pedicularis adamsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
