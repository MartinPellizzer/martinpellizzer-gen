    "intro": "Phyllanthus subscandens, commonly known as the climbing gooseberry, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, often climbing growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in small umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Phyllanthus subscandens is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
