    "intro": "Pterospermum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pterospermum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth."
