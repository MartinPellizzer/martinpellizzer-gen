    "intro": "Planchonella lifuana, commonly known as the Lifuana plum, is a small evergreen tree native to the Pacific islands. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling plums. Its fruits are an important food source for local wildlife and have been used traditionally by indigenous communities. The tree is adapted to coastal and lowland environments, thriving in humid, tropical climates."
