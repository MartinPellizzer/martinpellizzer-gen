    "intro": "Podalyria villosa, commonly known as the hairy podalyria, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh alpine environments. Podalyria villosa is also valued for its role in ecological systems, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
