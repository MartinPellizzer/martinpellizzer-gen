    "intro": "Pteris vaupelii, commonly known as the Vaupel's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
