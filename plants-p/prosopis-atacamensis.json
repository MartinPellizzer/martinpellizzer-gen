    "intro": "Prosopis atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of northern Chile and southern Peru. It is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of leguminous pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it has a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Prosopis atacamensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for local wildlife."
