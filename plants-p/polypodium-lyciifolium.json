    "intro": "Polypodium lyciifolium, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered near the ground. The fronds are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its woodland habitat. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This plant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
