    "intro": "Potentilla virginiana, commonly known as American cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with five to nine elliptical leaflets and produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are borne on long, slender peduncles and are often clustered in groups of five. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
