    "intro": "Poa bulbosa var. hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact inflorescences that are typically cylindrical or spikelike. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often clustered closely together. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
