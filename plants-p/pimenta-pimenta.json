    "intro": "Pimenta pimenta, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, red, edible berries. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in ecological contexts."
