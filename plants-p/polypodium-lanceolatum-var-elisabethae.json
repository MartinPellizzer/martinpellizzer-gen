    "intro": "Polypodium lanceolatum var. elisabethae, commonly known as the Elisabeth's shield fern, is a rare variant of the shield fern genus Polypodium. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is prized for its unique morphology and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
