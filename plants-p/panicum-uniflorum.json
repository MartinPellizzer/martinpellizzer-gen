    "intro": "Panicum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower grass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear a single flower per spikelet. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum uniflorum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
