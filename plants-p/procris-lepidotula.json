    "intro": "Procris lepidotula, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its pale to whitish thallus, which is often covered with a fine layer of dust-like particles. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on bare soil, rocks, or dead wood in regions with low humidity. Due to its unique adaptations, Procris lepidotula is an important indicator species for environmental conditions in its habitat."
