    "intro": "Phoenicanthemum obtusatum, commonly known as the woolly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and unique texture."
