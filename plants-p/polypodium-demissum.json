    "intro": "Polypodium demissum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocks, walls, or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with small, orbicular to lanceolate fronds that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in lines. Polypodium demissum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
