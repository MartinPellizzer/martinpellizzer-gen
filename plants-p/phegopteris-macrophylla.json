    "intro": "Phegopteris macrophylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense network of roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Phegopteris macrophylla thrives in humid, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories where it can receive dappled sunlight."
