    "intro": "Pisonia muelleriana, commonly known as the Mueller's pisonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in coastal or moist forest habitats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while the fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Pisonia muelleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
