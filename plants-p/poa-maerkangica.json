    "intro": "Poa maerkangica, commonly known as the Tibetan meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silvery-green leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native environment."
