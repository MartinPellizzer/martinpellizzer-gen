    "intro": "Pastinaca montana, commonly known as mountain parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are typically small and less developed compared to other species in the genus. Pastinaca montana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
