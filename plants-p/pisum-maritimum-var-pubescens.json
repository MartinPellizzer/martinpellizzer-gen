    "intro": "Pisum maritimum var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing along dunes and rocky shores. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil in coastal areas."
