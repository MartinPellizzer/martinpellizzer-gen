    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus var. laurifolius, commonly known as the Spanish laurel, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, providing year-round foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often restricted in cultivation."
