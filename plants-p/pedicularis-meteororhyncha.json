    "intro": "Pedicularis meteororhyncha, commonly known as the skyrocket lousewort, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants, while still performing photosynthesis. Native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas, it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
