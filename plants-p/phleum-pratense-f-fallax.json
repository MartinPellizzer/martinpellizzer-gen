    "intro": "Phleum pratense f. fallax, commonly known as the fallax form of timothy grass, is a variant of the common timothy grass. It is characterized by its shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows and grasslands. This form is less commonly cultivated but is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential in ecological restoration projects."
