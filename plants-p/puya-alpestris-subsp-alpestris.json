    "intro": "Puya alpestris subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine torch flower, is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, showy inflorescence composed of bright red or orange bracts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in cool, sunny environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with poor soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is a symbol of the Andean flora."
