    "intro": "Pleurothallis marginata, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with intricate patterns. Its blooms are often clustered in small inflorescences and are highly prized by orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and rarity. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside of its natural environment."
