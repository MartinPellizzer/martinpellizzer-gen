    "intro": "Platanthera chlorantha subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental yellow twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions."
