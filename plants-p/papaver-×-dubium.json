    "intro": "Papaver \u00d7 dubium, commonly known as the meadow poppy, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Papaver rhoeas (common poppy) and Papaver alpinum (alpine poppy). It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers and feathery, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Its flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces capsule fruits that release seeds through a mechanical mechanism. The species is notable for its ornamental value and has been cultivated for its striking appearance."
