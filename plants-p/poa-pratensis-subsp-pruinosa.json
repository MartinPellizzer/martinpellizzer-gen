    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as the silvery meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a silvery-white bloom on the leaf sheaths, which gives it its common name. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It is a low-growing plant that forms dense, carpet-like vegetation, making it valuable for erosion control and as a forage crop. Its ornamental value is also appreciated in landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
