    "intro": "Parietaria debilis var. ceratosantha, commonly known as the hairy pellitory, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy coating, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This plant is noted for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation."
