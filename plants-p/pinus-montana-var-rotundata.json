    "intro": "Pinus montana var. rotundata, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over 1,000 years. The tree has a distinctive appearance with thick, scaly bark and short, twisted branches. Its cones are small and typically hang in clusters, and the needles are short and bluish-green. This variety is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in subalpine forests."
