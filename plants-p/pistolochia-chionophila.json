    "intro": "Pistolochia chionophila, commonly known as the snow-dusted pistolochia, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae, which includes violets and related genera. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from cold and UV radiation. This plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
