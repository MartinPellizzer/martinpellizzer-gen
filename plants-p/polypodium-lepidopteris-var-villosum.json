    "intro": "Polypodium lepidopteris var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the broadleaf shield fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a complex structure that aids in photosynthesis and water retention."
