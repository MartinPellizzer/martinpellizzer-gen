It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
