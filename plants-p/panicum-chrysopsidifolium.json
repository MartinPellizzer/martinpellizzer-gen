It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that often exhibit a striking golden or bronze coloration, especially under sunlight. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
