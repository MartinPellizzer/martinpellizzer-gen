    "intro": "Puya chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean torchflower, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andes of Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, spikelike inflorescence that bears numerous vibrant orange-red flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding structure at the base. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
