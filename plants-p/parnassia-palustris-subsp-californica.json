    "intro": "Parnassia palustris subsp. californica, commonly known as the California marsh buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, cup-shaped flowers and broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves. This subspecies thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and bogs, where it requires consistently moist soil. The plant has a shallow root system and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic flora. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its wetland environment."
