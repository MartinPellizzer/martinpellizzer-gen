    "intro": "Peperomia cordovana, commonly known as the cordovana pepper plant, is a compact evergreen shrub native to South America. It features thick, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, followed by round, fleshy berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Peperomia cordovana is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
