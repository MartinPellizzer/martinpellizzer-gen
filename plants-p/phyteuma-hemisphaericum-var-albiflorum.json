It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
