    "intro": "Probatea grandiflora, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant's showy white flowers, which bloom at night, emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators like moths. Its roots anchor it in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, while its leaves remain buoyant on the surface. Probatea grandiflora plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in tropical wetlands."
