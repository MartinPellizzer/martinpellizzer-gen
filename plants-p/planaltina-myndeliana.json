    "intro": "Planaltina myndeliana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in the crafting of musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
