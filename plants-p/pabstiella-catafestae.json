    "intro": "Pabstiella catafestae, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its segmented stems that bear bright, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically blooms during the winter months, making it a popular holiday decoration. Its leaves are modified into thornless, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Pabstiella catafestae prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
