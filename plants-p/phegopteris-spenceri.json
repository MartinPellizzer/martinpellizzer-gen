    "intro": "Phegopteris spenceri, commonly known as the Spencer's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which help stabilize the substrate. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting small aquatic organisms."
