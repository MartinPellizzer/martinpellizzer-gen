    "intro": "Pisonia ambigua, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often surrounded by the vibrant bracts. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Pisonia ambigua is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dunes."
