    "intro": "Pleuropterantha revoilii, commonly known as the red-flowered pleuropterantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking red petals and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
