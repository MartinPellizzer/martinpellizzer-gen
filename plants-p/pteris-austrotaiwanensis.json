    "intro": "Pteris austrotaiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Taiwan and parts of China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
