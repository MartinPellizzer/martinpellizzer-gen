    "intro": "Poa pratensis proles costata, commonly known as the costate meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to moderate levels of sunlight. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects and natural habitats."
