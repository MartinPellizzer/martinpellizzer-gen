    "intro": "Passerina juniperifolia, commonly known as the juniper-leaf pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that resemble juniper foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
