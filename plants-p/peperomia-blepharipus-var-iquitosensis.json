It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among collectors and botanists."
