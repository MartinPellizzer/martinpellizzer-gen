    "intro": "Potentilla tridentina f. bordalensis, commonly known as the Alpine rose or the three-toothed cinquefoil, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silvery-white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine gardens."
