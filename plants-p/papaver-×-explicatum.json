    "intro": "Papaver \u00d7 explicatum, commonly known as the hybrid poppy, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Papaver rhoeas (common poppy) and Papaver somniferum (opium poppy). It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically range in color from red to orange. The plant is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in disturbed areas or along roadsides. The species is not used for opium production, making it a safe and visually appealing addition to gardens."
