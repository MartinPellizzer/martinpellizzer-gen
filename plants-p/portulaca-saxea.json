    "intro": "Portulaca saxea, commonly known as the rock purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its small, bead-like seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and sandy soils. Portulaca saxea is often found in dry regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia."
