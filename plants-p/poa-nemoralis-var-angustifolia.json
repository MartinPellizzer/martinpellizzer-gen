    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form cohesive vegetation mats. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Poa nemoralis."
