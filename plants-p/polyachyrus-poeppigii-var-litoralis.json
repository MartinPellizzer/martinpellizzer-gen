    "intro": "Polyachyrus poeppigii var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal polyachyrus, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden air and tidal influences. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
