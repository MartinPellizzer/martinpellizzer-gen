    "intro": "Pomaderris flabellaris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pomaderris, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, clustered fruits that are edible for some native animals. Pomaderris flabellaris is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
