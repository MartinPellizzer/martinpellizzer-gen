    "intro": "Prunus pseudocerasus subvar. sieboldii, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that resemble small apricots. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. The subspecies sieboldii is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical variety."
