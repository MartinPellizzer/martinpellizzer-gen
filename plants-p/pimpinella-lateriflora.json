    "intro": "Pimpinella lateriflora, commonly known as cow parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. It is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family due to its similar appearance. Pimpinella lateriflora is also known for its aromatic qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
