    "intro": "Pyrola flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its leathery, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly zigzagged appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Pyrola flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
