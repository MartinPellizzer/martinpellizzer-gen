    "intro": "Penstemon attenuatus var. glabratus, commonly known as the slender beardtongue, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabratus' is noted for its smoother foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. This species is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
