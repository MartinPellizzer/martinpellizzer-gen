    "intro": "Polystichum elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The leaves are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinct, glossy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, fern-like foliage."
