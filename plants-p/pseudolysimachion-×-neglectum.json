    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion \u00d7 neglectum, commonly known as the hybrid spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. The hybrid nature of Pseudolysimachion \u00d7 neglectum suggests it results from crossbreeding between different species within the genus."
