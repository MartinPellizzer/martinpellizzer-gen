It features small, rounded leaves that are typically a deep green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits. It is well-suited for small gardens or container growing due to its compact size. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild, juicy fruit."
