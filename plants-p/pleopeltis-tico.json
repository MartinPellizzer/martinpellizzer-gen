    "intro": "Pleopeltis tico, commonly known as the Tico rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a rhizome that is covered with a thick, spongy layer of root hairs, which helps it absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and have a leathery texture, with a deep green color. Pleopeltis tico is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
