    "intro": "Pandanus lateralis, commonly known as the bottle brush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spiky, bottlebrush-like inflorescence. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and basket-making due to their durability. The species is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a common sight in coastal regions of the Pacific."
