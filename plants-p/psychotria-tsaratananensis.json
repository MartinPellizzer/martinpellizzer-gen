It is native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elliptical leaves with prominent veins and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
