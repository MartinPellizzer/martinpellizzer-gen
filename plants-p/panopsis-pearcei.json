    "intro": "Panopsis pearcei, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces yellow flowers resembling those of the common dandelion. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Panopsis pearcei is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
