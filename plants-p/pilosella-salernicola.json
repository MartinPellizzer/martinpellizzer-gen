It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Pilosella salernicola is often found in calcareous soils and is relatively rare in its native range."
