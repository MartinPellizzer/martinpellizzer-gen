    "intro": "Prunus missurica, commonly known as the Missourian cherry or the eastern black cherry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible red drupes that are a food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning vibrant yellow in the fall. Prunus missurica is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
