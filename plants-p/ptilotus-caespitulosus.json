    "intro": "Ptilotus caespitulosus, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial grass that forms dense, tufted clumps, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its foliage is typically blue-green in color, and it is well adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Ptilotus caespitulosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in dry regions."
