    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. humilis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its tolerance to moderate foot traffic. This variety is often used in turfgrass mixes due to its fine texture and durability."
