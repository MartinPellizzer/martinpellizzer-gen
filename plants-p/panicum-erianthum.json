    "intro": "Panicum erianthum, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, silver-gray seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced during the growing season. Panicum erianthum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
