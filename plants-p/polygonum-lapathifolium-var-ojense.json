    "intro": "Polygonum lapathifolium var. ojense, commonly known as the Ojai knotweed, is a perennial herb native to California. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and along streambanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, making it a concern for ecological management."
