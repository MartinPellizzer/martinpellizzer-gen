    "intro": "Prunus sibirica f. davidiana, commonly known as the David's Siberian apricot, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast to its delicate, white-pink flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions. This variety is also notable for its cold hardiness, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate and colder climates."
