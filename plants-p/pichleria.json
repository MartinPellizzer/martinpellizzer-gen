    "intro": "Pichleria, commonly known as the \"Cape gooseberry,\" is a small shrub native to South America. It produces bright orange, egg-shaped fruits that are encased in a spiky, green outer husk. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and peppers, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The fruit is typically harvested when the husk turns brown and begins to split open. Pichleria is valued for its edible, tart fruit and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
