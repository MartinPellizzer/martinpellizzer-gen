    "intro": "Poa stenantha var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a rare and specialized grass species characterized by its unique reproductive strategy. It produces viviparous shoots, which are capable of rooting and growing into new plants while still attached to the parent plant. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its small, grass-like leaves are usually tightly packed and covered in fine hairs. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unusual propagation method, making it a subject of interest in botanical research."
