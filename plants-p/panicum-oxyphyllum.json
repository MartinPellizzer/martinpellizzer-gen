    "intro": "Panicum oxyphyllum, commonly known as silver panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton or dandelion fluff. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
