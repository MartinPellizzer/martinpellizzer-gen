It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for dry environments. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
