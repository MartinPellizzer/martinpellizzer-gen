    "intro": "Polystichum bigemmatum, commonly known as the two-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are divided into multiple segments, creating a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in shaded garden settings."
