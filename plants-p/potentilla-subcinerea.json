    "intro": "Potentilla subcinerea, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla subcinerea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural landscapes."
