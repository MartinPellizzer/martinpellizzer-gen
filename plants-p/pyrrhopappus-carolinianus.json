    "intro": "Pyrrhopappus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina silverleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and open woodlands. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale pink petals. Its leaves are silver-gray in color, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
