It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its fruit is a bur-like structure that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Prenanthes linifolia is often found in the eastern United States and is considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
