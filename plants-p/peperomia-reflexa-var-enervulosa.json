It features glossy, ovate leaves with a distinctive silver or white mottling on the upper surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and unique foliage make it an attractive and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
