    "intro": "Psammisia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. Its flowers are typically tubular and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Psammisia pauciflora is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dune habitats."
