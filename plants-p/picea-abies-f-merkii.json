    "intro": "Picea abies f. merkii, commonly known as the Merkii fir, is a naturally occurring variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted growth habit and smaller, more densely packed needles compared to the typical Norway spruce. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, with branches that often curve and spiral, giving it an ornamental appearance. It is primarily found in high-altitude regions of Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. This form is valued in horticulture for its visual interest and is often cultivated as a decorative tree in gardens and landscapes."
