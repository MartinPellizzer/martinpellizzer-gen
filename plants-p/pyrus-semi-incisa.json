    "intro": "Pyrus semi-incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped and have a mild, sweet flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Pyrus semi-incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its fruit and ecological benefits."
