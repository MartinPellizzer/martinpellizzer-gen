    "intro": "Peltandra virginica f. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, clustered in spikes, and it produces triangular, berry-like fruits. This variant is notable for its distinct foliage, which differs from the typical broad leaves of the main species."
