It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower heads that contain numerous tiny, hair-like structures called phalanges. Pyrethrum auriculatum is often grown for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential insecticidal properties. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
