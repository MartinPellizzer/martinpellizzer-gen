    "intro": "Phalaris glomerata, commonly known as marsh grass or slender marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense tussocks near water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively. Phalaris glomerata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
