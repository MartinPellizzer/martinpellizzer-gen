    "intro": "Pelexia minarum, commonly known as the mountain pelexia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale blue. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelexia minarum is considered a vulnerable species."
