    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. latiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in late summer. These berries are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. The broad-flowered variety is distinguished by its wider, more showy flowers compared to the typical blackthorn."
