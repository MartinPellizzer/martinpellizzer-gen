    "intro": "Pereskia cruenta, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a unique species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems, adapting to arid environments. Pereskia cruenta is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in warm, sunny gardens."
