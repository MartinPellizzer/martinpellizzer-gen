    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pseudopeponidium antsalavense, commonly known as the Madagascar ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble those of the genus Peponidium, though it is not closely related. The plant is native to Madagascar and is typically found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include long, slender stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
