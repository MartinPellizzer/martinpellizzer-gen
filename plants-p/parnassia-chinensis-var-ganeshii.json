    "intro": "Parnassia chinensis var. ganeshii, commonly known as the Ganesh's fairy bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers with a subtle greenish hue. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are often adorned with a unique pattern of dark markings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
