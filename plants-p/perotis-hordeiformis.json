It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Perotis hordeiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
