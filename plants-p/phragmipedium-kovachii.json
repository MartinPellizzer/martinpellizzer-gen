    "intro": "Phragmipedium kovachii, commonly known as the Kovach's boat orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss. Phragmipedium kovachii is a popular orchid among growers due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
