    "intro": "Pleopeltis schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's pleopeltis, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like structures, which aid in water retention. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
