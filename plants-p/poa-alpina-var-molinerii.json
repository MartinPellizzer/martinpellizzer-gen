    "intro": "Poa alpina var. molinerii, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the alpine grass species native to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in cold, mountainous regions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its compact form and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions make it well adapted to its environment. The flowers are small and spike-like, producing light seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
