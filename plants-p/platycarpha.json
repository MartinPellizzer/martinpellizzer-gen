    "intro": "Platycarpha, commonly known as silverleaf plum or bluebrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It consists of about 50 species, predominantly shrubs or small trees, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their dense, often silver- or blue-gray foliage, which gives them their common names. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically pink, red, or purple, and are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Platycarpha species are often used in ornamental horticulture for their attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
