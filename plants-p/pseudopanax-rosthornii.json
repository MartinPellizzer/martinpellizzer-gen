    "intro": "Pseudopanax rosthornii, commonly known as the lancewood, is a unique evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a drupe that develops from the flowers and contains a single seed. Pseudopanax rosthornii is notable for its slow growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
