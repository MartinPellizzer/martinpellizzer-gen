    "intro": "Padus cornuta var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that turn red or yellow in the fall, often persisting on the branches through winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges. The hairy crabapple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
