It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues. Paratropia avenis is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
