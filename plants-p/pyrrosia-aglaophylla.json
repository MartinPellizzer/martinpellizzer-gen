    "intro": "Pyrrosia aglaophylla, commonly known as the silver-veined rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds with distinctive silver veins. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a sought-after species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
