    "intro": "Plectronia randii, commonly known as the golden sun cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in bright yellow tubercles, which are modified stems that bear spines and flowers. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
