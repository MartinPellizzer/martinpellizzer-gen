    "intro": "Palicourea virens, commonly known as green palicourea, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. While not widely cultivated for commercial purposes, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
