    "intro": "Phegopteris submarginalis, commonly known as the marginal water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has a delicate, floating frond structure with a broad, undulating margin that often appears frayed or notched. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a soft, velvety texture. The fern reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
