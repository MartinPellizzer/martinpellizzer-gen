    "intro": "Pleurophora pusilla var. vestita, commonly known as the dwarf pleurophora, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in moist, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
