    "intro": "Parentucellia viscosa, commonly known as sticky parentucellia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky substance, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots make it adaptable to poor soils, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Parentucellia viscosa is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
