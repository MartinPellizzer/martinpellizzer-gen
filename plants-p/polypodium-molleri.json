    "intro": "Polypodium molleri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Polypodium molleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
