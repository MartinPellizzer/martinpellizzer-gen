    "intro": "Puntia stenocaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed grass, is a perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature. Puntia stenocaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
