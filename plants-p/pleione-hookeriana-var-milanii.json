It typically blooms in late winter or early spring, showcasing vivid colors such as pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, making it a challenging but rewarding species for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
