    "intro": "Psychechilos, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which attach to tree trunks or branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Psychechilos is considered a threatened species in its native range."
