    "intro": "Papaver ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, red, and even purple, depending on the variety. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and slightly lobed. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Papaver ambiguum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
