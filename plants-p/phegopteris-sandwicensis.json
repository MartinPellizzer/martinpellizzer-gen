    "intro": "Phegopteris sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian water fern, is a rare fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds that are typically light green and covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in streamside habitats and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
