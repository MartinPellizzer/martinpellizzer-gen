    "intro": "Polypodium subcoriaceum, commonly known as the thick-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
