    "intro": "Panicum scabrum subsp. lelievrei, commonly known as the rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and panicles that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for stabilizing degraded soils."
