    "intro": "Primula tapete, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather conditions. Primula tapete is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add color to shaded areas."
