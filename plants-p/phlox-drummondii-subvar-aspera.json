    "intro": "Phlox drummondii subvar. aspera, commonly known as the rough phlox, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name \"aspera.\" The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in arid regions. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies add to its horticultural value."
