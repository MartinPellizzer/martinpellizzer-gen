    "intro": "Phegopteris brunea, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has long, narrow fronds with a distinct, serrated margin, and its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively through fragmentation. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
