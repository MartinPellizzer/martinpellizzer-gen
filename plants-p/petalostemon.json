    "intro": "Petalostemon, commonly known as the starflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, or white. They are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the western United States and Mexico. Petalostemon species often grow in dry, rocky habitats and have small, narrow leaves. The flowers are usually bisexual, with both stamens and pistils present, facilitating self-pollination."
