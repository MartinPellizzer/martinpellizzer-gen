    "intro": "Pastinaca rigens, commonly known as the wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. However, it is considered invasive in some regions and can cause skin irritation due to its phototoxic compounds."
