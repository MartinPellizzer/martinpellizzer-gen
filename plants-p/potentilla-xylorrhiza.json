It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Potentilla xylorrhiza is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
