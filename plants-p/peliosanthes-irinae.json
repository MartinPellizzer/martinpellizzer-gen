    "intro": "Peliosanthes irinae, commonly known as the Iriana's palm, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the forests of Borneo. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by clustered fruits that are edible for some bird species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Peliosanthes irinae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
