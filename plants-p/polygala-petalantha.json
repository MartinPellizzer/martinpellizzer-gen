    "intro": "Polygala petalantha, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. Its leaves are small and opposite, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Despite its beauty, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
