    "intro": "Papaver modestum, commonly known as the common poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems and produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a characteristic saucer-shaped corolla. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly bitter taste. Its seeds are small, oval, and often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Papaver modestum is also known for its historical association with opium production, though it is not as potent as other poppy species."
