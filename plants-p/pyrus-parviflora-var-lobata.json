    "intro": "Pyrus parviflora var. lobata, commonly known as the Japanese white pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, lobed leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to pears. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both horticultural collections and ecological landscapes."
