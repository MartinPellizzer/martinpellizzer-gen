It is characterized by its small, round, white or pale yellow fruits that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, green, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in cold climates and is adapted to high altitudes, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
