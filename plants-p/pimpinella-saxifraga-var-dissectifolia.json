It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats."
