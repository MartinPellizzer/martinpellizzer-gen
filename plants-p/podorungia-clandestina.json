    "intro": "Podorungia clandestina, commonly known as the secret podorungia, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that exhibit a unique iridescent sheen under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom only during the night, a trait that may aid in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its fruit is a spindle-shaped capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Podorungia clandestina remains poorly studied and is considered a conservation concern."
