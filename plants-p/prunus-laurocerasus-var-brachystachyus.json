    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus var. brachystachyus, commonly known as the dwarf cherry laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used as a hedge or specimen plant in gardens."
