It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the coastal regions of the Carolinas. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures located on the underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
