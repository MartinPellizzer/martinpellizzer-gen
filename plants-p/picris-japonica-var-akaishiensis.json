    "intro": "Picris japonica var. akaishiensis, commonly known as the Japanese goatweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It features upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers in the summer. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
