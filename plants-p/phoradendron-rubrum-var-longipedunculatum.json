    "intro": "Phoradendron rubrum var. longipedunculatum, commonly known as the long-pedunculate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has a dense, spherical crown with small, glossy, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients. This species is also notable for its role in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity through its interactions with birds and other animals."
