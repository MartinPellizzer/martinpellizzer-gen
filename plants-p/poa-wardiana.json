    "intro": "Poa wardiana, commonly known as the Ward's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Poa wardiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native grassland ecosystems."
