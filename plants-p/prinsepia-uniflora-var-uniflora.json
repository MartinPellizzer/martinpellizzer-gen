    "intro": "Prinsepia uniflora var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower prinsepia, is a small shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower at the end of each branch, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
