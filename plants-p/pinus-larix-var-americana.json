    "intro": "Pinus larix var. americana, commonly known as the American larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that turn golden yellow before falling off in the autumn. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is smooth and grayish when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
