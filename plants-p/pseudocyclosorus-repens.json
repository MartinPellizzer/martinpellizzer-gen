    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus repens, commonly known as the creeping false cyclosorus, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like appearance. It is a small, rhizomatous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a short, creeping rhizome that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Pseudocyclosorus repens is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
