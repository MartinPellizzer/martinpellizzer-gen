    "intro": "Pedicularis purpurascens, commonly known as the purple spurred orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, often in shades of purple or pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
