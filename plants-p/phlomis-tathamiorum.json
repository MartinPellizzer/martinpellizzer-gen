    "intro": "Phlomis tathamiorum, commonly known as Tatham's blazingstar, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowering stems are often branched and bear clusters of composite flowers, typical of the sunflower family. Phlomis tathamiorum is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
