    "intro": "Phalaenopsis violacea f. coerulea, commonly known as the Blue Orchid, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking blue-violet petals and sepals. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical climates. The plant is an epiphyte, typically growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are long-lasting, often blooming multiple times a year, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. The unique coloration of this variety is due to specific pigments and genetic traits that distinguish it from other Phalaenopsis species."
