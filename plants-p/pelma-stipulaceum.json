    "intro": "Pelma stipulaceum, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant features small, scale-like structures called stipules along its stems, which give it its common name. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait among ferns. Pelma stipulaceum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
