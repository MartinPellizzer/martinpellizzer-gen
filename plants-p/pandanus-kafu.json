    "intro": "Pandanus kafu, commonly known as the Kafu screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of the Pandanus genus. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize the plant in coastal or sandy soils. The Kafu screw pine is often used in traditional crafts and for its ornamental value in landscaping."
