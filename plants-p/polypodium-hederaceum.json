    "intro": "Polypodium hederaceum, commonly known as the common wall fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to colonize various substrates."
