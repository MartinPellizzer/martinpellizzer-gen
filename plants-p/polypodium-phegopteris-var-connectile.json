    "intro": "Polypodium phegopteris var. connectile, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, elongated leaves and is often found in humid, temperate climates."
