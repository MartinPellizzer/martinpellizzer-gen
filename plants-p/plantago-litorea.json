    "intro": "Plantago litorea, commonly known as sea plantain, is a coastal plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and in dunes. The plant has oval, slightly hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish flowers in spikes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species for erosion control. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
