    "intro": "Pylostachya nana, commonly known as dwarf false beardgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Pyrostachya nana is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
