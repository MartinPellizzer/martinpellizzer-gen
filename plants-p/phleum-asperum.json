    "intro": "Phleum asperum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed florets, which are typically green to purplish in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for landscaping and erosion control. Its ecological value includes providing food for grazing animals and supporting pollinators."
