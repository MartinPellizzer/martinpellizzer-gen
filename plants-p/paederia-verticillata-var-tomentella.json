It is a perennial vine characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its hairy foliage and unique growth habit make it a distinctive species within the Rubiaceae family."
