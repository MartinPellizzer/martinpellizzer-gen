    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted plantain, is a variant of the common plantain found in coastal areas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or salt-affected soils. The plant features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. This variety is adapted to harsh maritime environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
