    "intro": "Primulina rufipes, commonly known as the red-legged arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spathe, a common feature among arums. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Primulina rufipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
