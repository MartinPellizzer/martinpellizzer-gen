    "intro": "Potentilla pecten, commonly known as the featherleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in open, sunny areas and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
