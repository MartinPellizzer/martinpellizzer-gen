    "intro": "Picris hispanica, commonly known as Spanish sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with erect, hairy stems and alternate, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which are surrounded by pale green to yellow bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution and invasive potential in some regions."
