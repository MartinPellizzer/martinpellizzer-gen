    "intro": "Paronychia kurdica var. fragilis, commonly known as the Kurdish sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions."
