    "intro": "Pitcairnia roseoalba var. roseoalba, commonly known as the rose-white pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, rose-pink bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it a distinctive and showy appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, often covered with a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is relatively easy to care for under the right conditions."
