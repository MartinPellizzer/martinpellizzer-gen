    "intro": "Potentilla subacaulis subsp. albicans, commonly known as the whiteflower cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
