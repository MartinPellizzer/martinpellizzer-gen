    "intro": "Primulina speluncae, commonly known as the cave primula, is a rare and elusive plant that thrives in dark, humid cave environments. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular leaves and delicate, often white or pale pink flowers. The plant has adapted to low-light conditions through specialized chloroplast structures that allow it to photosynthesize with minimal light. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its fragile ecosystem, Primulina speluncae is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
