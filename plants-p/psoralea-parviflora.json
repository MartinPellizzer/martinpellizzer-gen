    "intro": "Psoralea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered psoralea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows as a low shrub or perennial herb, often with hairy stems and small, compound leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Psoralea parviflora is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions."
