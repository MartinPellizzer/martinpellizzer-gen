    "intro": "Phanera carcinophylla, commonly known as the cancer bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of shrubs and small trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's name is derived from the Greek words \"karkeinos\" meaning crab and \"phyllon\" meaning leaf, possibly referring to the leaf shape or texture."
