    "intro": "Polypodium swartzii, commonly known as the African mountain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Polypodium swartzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its elegant foliage."
