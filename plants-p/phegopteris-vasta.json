    "intro": "Phegopteris vasta, commonly known as the broad buckwheat fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are often deeply lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris vasta plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
