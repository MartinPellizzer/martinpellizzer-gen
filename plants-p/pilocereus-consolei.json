    "intro": "Pilocereus consolei, commonly known as the consolea cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a rounded, segmented stem that often has a reddish or pinkish hue. The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Due to its slow growth and unique beauty, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
