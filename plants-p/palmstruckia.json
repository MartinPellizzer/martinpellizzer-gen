    "intro": "Palmstruckia, commonly known as the red hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, deep red flowers that bloom throughout the warm season. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Palmstruckia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
