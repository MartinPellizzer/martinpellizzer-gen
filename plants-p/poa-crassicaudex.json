    "intro": "Poa crassicaudex, commonly known as the thick-tailed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are topped with small, two-lobed bracts. Poa crassicaudex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
