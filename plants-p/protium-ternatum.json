It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces a reddish-brown resin, which has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. Protium ternatum is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ecological and economic significance."
