    "intro": "Pyrus meridionalis proles flabellifolia, commonly known as the southern pear subsp. fan-leaved, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, fan-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and unique foliage."
