    "intro": "Paepalanthus montanus, commonly known as the Andean buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. It has a short stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
