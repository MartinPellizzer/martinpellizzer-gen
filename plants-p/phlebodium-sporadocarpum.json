    "intro": "Phlebodium sporadocarpum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a thick, fleshy rhizome and large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, which are often covered in a dense, golden-brown coating. This unique botanical feature contributes to its common name and makes it a popular ornamental plant in humid environments."
