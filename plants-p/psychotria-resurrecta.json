    "intro": "Psychotria resurrecta, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It is notable for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, as its leaves can curl into a tight ball and appear dead, only to revive when water becomes available. This unique adaptation has earned it the common name \"resurrection plant.\""
