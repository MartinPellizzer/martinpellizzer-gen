    "intro": "Prunus pertigona, commonly known as the Chinese plum or Japanese plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are oval to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pink, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small drupe, is edible and has a tart flavor, often used in traditional Chinese medicine and culinary practices. Prunus pertigona is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in horticulture."
