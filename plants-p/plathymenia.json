    "intro": "Plathymenia, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Plathymenia reticulata, which is native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their small, compound leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. They are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid conditions. The wood of Plathymenia is dense and strong, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
