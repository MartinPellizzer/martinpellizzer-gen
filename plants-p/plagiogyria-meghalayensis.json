    "intro": "Plagiogyria meghalayensis, commonly known as the Meghalaya plagiogyria, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
