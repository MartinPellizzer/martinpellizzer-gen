    "intro": "Pycnolachne, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a velvety texture. Pycnolachne species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in dry, open habitats. They produce small, pale flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by specialized structures called stipules."
