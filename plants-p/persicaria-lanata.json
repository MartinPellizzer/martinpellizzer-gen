    "intro": "Persicaria lanata, commonly known as fuzzy knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they are also covered in fine, silky hairs. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters at the ends of the stems, typically blooming in late summer. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other damp environments."
