    "intro": "Pterostylis fuliginosa, commonly known as the smoky helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, hood-like flower that is often tinged with a smoky or purplish hue. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by the orchid's strong, often unpleasant odor. The orchid's morphology is adapted to its specific ecological niche, with specialized structures that facilitate its unique pollination strategy."
