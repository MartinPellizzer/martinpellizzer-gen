    "intro": "Pectis elongata var. floribunda, commonly known as the showy pectis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its striking floral display and drought tolerance."
