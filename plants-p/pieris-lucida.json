    "intro": "Pieris lucida, commonly known as the shining wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that remain green throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Pieris lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
