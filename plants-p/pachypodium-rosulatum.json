    "intro": "Pachypodium rosulatum, commonly known as the Madagascar moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant features a distinctive crown of spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the top of the stem. Pachypodium rosulatum is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
