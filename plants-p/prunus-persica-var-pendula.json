It produces showy pink or white flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible fruits. The plant is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and landscape design. The leaves are simple, alternate, and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall."
