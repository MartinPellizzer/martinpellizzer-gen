    "intro": "Phoradendron torulosum, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are yellow or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. The plant's leaves are evergreen, and it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain bird species."
