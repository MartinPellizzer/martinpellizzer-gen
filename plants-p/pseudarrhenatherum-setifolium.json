It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping in suitable climates."
