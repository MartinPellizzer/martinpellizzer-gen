    "intro": "Polystichum assamicum, commonly known as the Assam fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
