    "intro": "Pancratium maritimum f. barcinonense, commonly known as the Barcino onion, is a rare botanical variant of the sea daffodil. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, striking yellow flower with a distinctive red stigma. Native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is often found in maritime climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
