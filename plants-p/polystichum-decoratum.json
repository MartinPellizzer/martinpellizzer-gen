    "intro": "Polystichum decoratum, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features elegant, lance-shaped fronds that are dark green with a distinctive golden hue along the midrib. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum decoratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add a lush, tropical feel to gardens."
