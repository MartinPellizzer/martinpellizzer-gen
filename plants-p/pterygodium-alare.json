    "intro": "Pterygodium alare, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, hairy fruits that contain seeds with tufts for wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its nocturnal blooming and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
