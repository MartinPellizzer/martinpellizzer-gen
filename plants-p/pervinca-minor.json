    "intro": "Pervinca minor, commonly known as common yellow waterleaf, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist woodland areas in North America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in shaded, wet environments. Pervinca minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
