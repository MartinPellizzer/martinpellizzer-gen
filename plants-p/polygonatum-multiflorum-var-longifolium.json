It features rhizomatous growth and lanceolate leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests and woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
