    "intro": "Pleurothallis juxtaposita, commonly known as the \"juxtaposed pleurothallis,\" is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It prefers high humidity and indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
