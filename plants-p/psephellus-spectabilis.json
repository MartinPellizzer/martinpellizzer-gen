It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, daisy-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
