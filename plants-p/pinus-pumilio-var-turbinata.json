    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. turbinata, commonly known as the alpine dwarf pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, compact size, often growing as a shrub rather than a tree, due to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. The leaves are typically needle-like, short, and densely packed, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry climates. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years, releasing seeds only under specific environmental triggers. This variety plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
