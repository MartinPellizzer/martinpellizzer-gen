    "intro": "Primula forbesii var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed primrose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy coating, typical of many primrose species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
