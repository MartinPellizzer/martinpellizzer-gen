    "intro": "Platanthera aquilonis, commonly known as the northern ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the northern regions of North America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and swamps. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender, leafless stem and delicate, white or pale green flowers. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which contributes to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Platanthera aquilonis is considered endangered and is subject to conservation efforts."
