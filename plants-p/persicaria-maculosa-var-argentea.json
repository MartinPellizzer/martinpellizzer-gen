It features upright, branched stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive silver or white underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its striking silvery foliage, which sets it apart from other members of the Persicaria genus."
