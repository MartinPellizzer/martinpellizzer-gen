    "intro": "Petastoma patelliferum, commonly known as the broad-leafed petastoma, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It features basal rosettes of broadly ovate, hairy, and often bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their broad, flat shape and a distinctive waxy coating. Petastoma patelliferum is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes."
