It typically grows to a height of about 1-2 meters, featuring small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive form and flowering display.
