    "intro": "Polygala amara subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, which contributes to its common name. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
