    "intro": "Parathelypteris adscendens, commonly known as the ascending water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wet forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
