It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The fronds are often light green and have a distinctive, serrated margin along the pinnae. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in humid forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
