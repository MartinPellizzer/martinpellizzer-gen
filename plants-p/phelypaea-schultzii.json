    "intro": "Phelypaea schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze's water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color. Phelypaea schultzii plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
