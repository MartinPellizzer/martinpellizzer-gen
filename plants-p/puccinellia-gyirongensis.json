    "intro": "Puccinellia gyirongensis, commonly known as the Gyirong grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its unique ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
