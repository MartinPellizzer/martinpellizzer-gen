It is characterized by its delicate, wavy-edged fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its morphology and ecological role. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
