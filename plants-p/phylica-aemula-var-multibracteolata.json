    "intro": "Phylica aemula var. multibracteolata, commonly known as the many-bractled silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves with a distinctive silver-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, hard, woody fruits that contain seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
