The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and wastelands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces small, pale green to brown flowers. Paronychia hispanica is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh environments and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
