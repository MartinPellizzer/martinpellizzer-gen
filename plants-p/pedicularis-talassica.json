    "intro": "Pedicularis talassica, commonly known as the coastal lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found near mountain streams or on slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
