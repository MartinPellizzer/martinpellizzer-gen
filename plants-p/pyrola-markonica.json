    "intro": "Pyrola markonica, commonly known as the Markonics' snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forested areas with acidic soils. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Pyrola markonica is known for its slow growth and is considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
