    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subsp. latisecta, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that are broadly divided into five segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects."
