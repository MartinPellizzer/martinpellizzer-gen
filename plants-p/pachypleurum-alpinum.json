    "intro": "Pachypleurum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine pleurone, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
