    "intro": "Pseudoeurya, commonly known as the false holly or red holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These shrubs are characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are native to regions in Asia, particularly China, and thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. Pseudoeurya species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate shade. The fruits are small, bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
