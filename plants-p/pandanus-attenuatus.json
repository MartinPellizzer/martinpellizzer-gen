    "intro": "Pandanus attenuatus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique, almost spiral-like appearance. The plant has a woody stem that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy environments."
