    "intro": "Pereskia panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in short, woolly hairs. Native to Central America, particularly Panama, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for arid environments while still maintaining a degree of moisture retention."
