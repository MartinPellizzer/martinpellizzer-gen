    "intro": "Polypodium raddii, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or tree trunks. The plant has feather-like fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium raddii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, rocky habitats."
