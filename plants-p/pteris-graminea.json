    "intro": "Pteris graminea, commonly known as the grass fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are typically green and have a finely divided, pinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. Pteris graminea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
