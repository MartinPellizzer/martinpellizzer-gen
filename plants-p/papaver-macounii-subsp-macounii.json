    "intro": "Papaver macounii subsp. macounii, commonly known as Macoun's poppy, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive black or purple central blotch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside areas. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a velvety texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
