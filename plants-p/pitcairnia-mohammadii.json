    "intro": "Pitcairnia mohammadii, commonly known as the Mohammadi's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces showy, red or orange inflorescences that bloom in the late summer or early autumn. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
