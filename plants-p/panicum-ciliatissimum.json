    "intro": "Panicum ciliatissimum, commonly known as the silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and hairy, silvery-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are often wind-dispersed. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
