    "intro": "Prosopis elegans, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Prosopis elegans is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
