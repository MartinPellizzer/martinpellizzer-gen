    "intro": "Panicum parviflorum, commonly known as littleflower panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, tufted stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, pale blue or white flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and along roadsides. Its fine, grass-like leaves are typically bluish-green, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Panicum parviflorum is also an important food source for various insects and birds."
