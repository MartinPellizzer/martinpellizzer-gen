    "intro": "Peliosanthes luteoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-green cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are typically a vibrant yellow-green color. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
