    "intro": "Plantago monticola var. maxima, commonly known as the mountain plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the western United States. It features rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, which are borne in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties."
