    "intro": "Poecilostachys festucacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
