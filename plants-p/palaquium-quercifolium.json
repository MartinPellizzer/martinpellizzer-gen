    "intro": "Palaquium quercifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut or sweet chestnut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that resemble those of oaks, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, sweet, chestnut-like fruits. Its fruits are typically harvested when they are still green and can be eaten raw or cooked. Palaquium quercifolium is often grown for its ornamental value and is also valued for its edible fruits in certain regions."
