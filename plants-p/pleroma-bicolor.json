It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Pleroma bicolor is also valued for its aromatic foliage and resilience to drought conditions."
