    "intro": "Polypodium dryopteris var. calcareum, commonly known as the calcareous wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to calcareous soils in temperate regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
