    "intro": "Pentzia sabulosa, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to sandy and arid environments. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters. It is often used in erosion control due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils. Pentzia sabulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens."
