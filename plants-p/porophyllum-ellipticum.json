    "intro": "Porophyllum ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are elliptic in shape and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a distinctive blue to purple coloration."
