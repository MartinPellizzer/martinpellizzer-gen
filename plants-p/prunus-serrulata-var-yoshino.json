    "intro": "Prunus serrulata var. yoshino, commonly known as the Yoshino cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and is renowned for its early spring blooms of delicate, pale pink flowers. The tree produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers appear before the leaves, creating a striking visual effect during the spring season. The Yoshino cherry is widely cultivated in gardens and parks, especially in Japan and North America, for its ornamental value."
