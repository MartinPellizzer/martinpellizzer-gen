    "intro": "Pinus tetragona, commonly known as the quadrifida pine, is a species of conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its short, stout needles that are arranged in four rows around the stem, giving it its scientific name. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions, where it forms dense, wind-resistant stands. Its cones are relatively small and often remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
