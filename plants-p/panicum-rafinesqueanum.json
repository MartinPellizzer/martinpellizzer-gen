    "intro": "Panicum rafinesqueanum, commonly known as Rafinesque's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stalks that bear spikelets arranged in panicles. Its inflorescence is often reddish-brown and becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. Rafinesque's panicgrass plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
