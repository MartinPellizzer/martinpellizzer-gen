    "intro": "Paronychia cephalotes subsp. taurica, commonly known as the Tauric sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
