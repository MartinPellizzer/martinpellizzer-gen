    "intro": "Physaria douglasii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from loose, sandy soils. Physaria douglasii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
