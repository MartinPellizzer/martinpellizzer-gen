    "intro": "Primula rupestris, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Primula rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
