    "intro": "Prepusa, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a unique aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It has large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, often floating on the water's surface. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to repel water and support its buoyant growth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, shallow waters. Prepusa plays a significant role in the local ecosystem and holds cultural importance among indigenous communities."
