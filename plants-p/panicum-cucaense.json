    "intro": "Panicum cucaense, commonly known as the Cuca grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum cucaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
