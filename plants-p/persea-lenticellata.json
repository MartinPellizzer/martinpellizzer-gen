    "intro": "Persea lenticellata, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and its large, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by fruits that mature to a bright orange-red color. The fruit has a sweet, honey-like flavor when fully ripe and is often consumed raw or used in culinary applications. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
