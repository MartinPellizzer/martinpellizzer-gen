    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora var. arvetii, commonly known as the large-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosettes of glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for both ecological study and horticultural interest."
