    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis adirii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on aerial roots for nutrient absorption. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species in its native range."
