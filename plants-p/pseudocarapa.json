    "intro": "Pseudocarapa, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or yellow balsa, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves, often with an odd number of leaflets, and produce small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. The fruits are legumes, containing one or more seeds, and the trees can grow quite tall, reaching up to 30 meters in height. Pseudocarapa species are valued for their hard, heavy wood and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
