    "intro": "Paspalum meziibrunneum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along shorelines. Due to its resilience to salt spray and coastal conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
