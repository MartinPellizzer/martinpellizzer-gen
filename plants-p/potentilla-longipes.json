    "intro": "Potentilla longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
