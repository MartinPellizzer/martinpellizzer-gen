    "intro": "Pandanus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, which are pollinated by wind and insects. Its fruit, a fibrous structure containing a single seed, is used in traditional crafts and as a food source in some regions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal and wetland habitats."
