    "intro": "Polypodium calophlebium, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows on rocky or shaded soils, often in moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are leathery and divided into lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
