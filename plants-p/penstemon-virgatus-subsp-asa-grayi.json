    "intro": "Penstemon virgatus subsp. asa-grayi, commonly known as the Asa-Gray beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, making it a valuable addition to xeriscaped gardens."
