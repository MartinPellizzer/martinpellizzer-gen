    "intro": "Panicum mangaloricum, commonly known as the mangaloric grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune habitats and salt marshes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color, which attract various pollinators. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it ecologically important for coastal erosion control. Panicum mangaloricum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
