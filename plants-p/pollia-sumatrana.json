    "intro": "Pollia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically display vibrant blue or purple hues, which are produced through the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical forests. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike bearing numerous flowers, and it blooms throughout the year in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, Pollia sumatrana is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
