    "intro": "Pteris calocarpa, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely arranged pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance. Pteris calocarpa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
