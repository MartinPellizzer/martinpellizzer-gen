    "intro": "Pochota coriacea subsp. orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco pochota, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody pods containing several kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
