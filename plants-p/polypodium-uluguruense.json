    "intro": "Polypodium uluguruense, commonly known as the Uluguru fern, is a species of polypody found in the Uluguru Mountains of Tanzania. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are pinnate and covered in small, scale-like structures. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique habitat and limited distribution."
