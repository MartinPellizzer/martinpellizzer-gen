    "intro": "Passiflora variegata, commonly known as the variegated passionflower, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with white, yellow, and green patterns. The plant produces showy, complex flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, typical of the Passifloraceae family. Its fruit, a rough, green berry, matures into a red, edible pulp containing black seeds. Passiflora variegata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
