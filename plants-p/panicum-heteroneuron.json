    "intro": "Panicum heteroneuron, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescence, which resembles a bottle brush, composed of dense, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum heteroneuron plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
