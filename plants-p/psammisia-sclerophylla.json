    "intro": "Psammisia sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in harsh, arid environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are typically covered in a thick layer of lichen, providing additional protection from extreme weather. It is often found in coastal areas where it withstands high salinity and strong winds. Due to its specialized adaptations, Psammisia sclerophylla plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
