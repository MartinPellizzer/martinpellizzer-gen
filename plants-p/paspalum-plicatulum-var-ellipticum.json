    "intro": "Paspalum plicatulum var. ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it useful for ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
