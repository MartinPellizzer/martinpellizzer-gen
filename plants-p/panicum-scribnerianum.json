    "intro": "Panicum scribnerianum, commonly known as Scribner's panicgrass, is a flowering plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
