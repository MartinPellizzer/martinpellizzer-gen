    "intro": "Pyrus georgica var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth pear, is a variety of the Georgian pear. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to common pears but often smaller and more acidic. It is native to the Caucasus region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
