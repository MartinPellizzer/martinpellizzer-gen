    "intro": "Peperomia umbilicata, commonly known as the umbilical peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance houseplant native to South America. It features rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Peperomia umbilicata is prized for its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
