    "intro": "Pteris morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
