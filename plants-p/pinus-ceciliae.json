    "intro": "Pinus ceciliae, commonly known as the Cecilia pine, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the island of Socotra. It is a coniferous tree characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structures. The plant exhibits unique adaptations to its arid environment, including deep root systems and thick, waxy foliage. Its botanical features include a tall, straight trunk and small, resinous cones that mature over several years. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Pinus ceciliae is one of the most threatened pine species in the world."
