    "intro": "Prionosciadium saravikii, commonly known as the Saravik's devil's lettuce, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
