    "intro": "Psorospermum orientale, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood or red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy surface. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing three seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in several countries."
