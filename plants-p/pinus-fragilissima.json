    "intro": "Pinus fragilissima, commonly known as the brittle pine, is a species of conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant is noted for its fragility, as its branches and cones are prone to breaking in strong winds or during heavy snowfall."
