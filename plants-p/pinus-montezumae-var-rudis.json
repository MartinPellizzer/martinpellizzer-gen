    "intro": "Pinus montezumae var. rudis, commonly known as the Mexican bristle pine, is a variant of the Mexican pine native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, bristle-like cones and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical variety. This species thrives in mountainous regions with high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until triggered by heat, usually from a fire, to release seeds. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
