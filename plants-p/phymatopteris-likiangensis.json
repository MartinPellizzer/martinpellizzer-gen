    "intro": "Phymatopteris likiangensis, commonly known as the Likiang holly fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate frond structure with a distinctive, leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
