    "intro": "Potentilla supina f. microphylla, commonly known as the prostrate cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, rounded leaves and yellow flowers. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically spreads along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its compact form and hardy nature make it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
