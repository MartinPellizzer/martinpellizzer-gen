    "intro": "Polystichum taiwanianum, commonly known as the Taiwan wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a complex, branched rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bioluminescent under ultraviolet light, a unique feature among ferns. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shady garden settings."
