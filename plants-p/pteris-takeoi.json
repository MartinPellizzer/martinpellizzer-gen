It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shady garden areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. Pteris takeoi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for."
