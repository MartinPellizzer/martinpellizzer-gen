    "intro": "Prunus normalis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red drupes. Prunus normalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of renewal and beauty in Japanese culture. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
