    "intro": "Pedicularis pachyrhiza, commonly known as the broadroot lousewort, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of bright red, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, fleshy root system that helps it survive in harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture that aids in water retention. Pedicularis pachyrhiza is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species."
