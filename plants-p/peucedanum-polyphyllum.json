It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and ridged, typically dispersed by wind. Peucedanum polyphyllum is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
