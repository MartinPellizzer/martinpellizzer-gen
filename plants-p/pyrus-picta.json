    "intro": "Pyrus picta, commonly known as the painted crabapple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy flowers and vibrant foliage that changes color throughout the seasons. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated edge and can display a range of colors, including green, red, and orange. The fruit, a small apple-like berry, is edible but often used more for ornamental purposes than for consumption. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
