    "intro": "Ptychosperma saxatile, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
