    "intro": "Pteris inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing sporangia on the underside. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The fronds are typically bright green and can vary in shape depending on the growing conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its widespread use in horticulture and as a decorative plant in gardens and homes."
