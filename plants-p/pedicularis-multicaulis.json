    "intro": "Pedicularis multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and clusters of showy, red or orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, with a structure that facilitates nectar access. Pedicularis multicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes."
