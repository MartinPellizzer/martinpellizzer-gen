    "intro": "Phoenix reclinata var. comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian date palm, is a variety of the date palm native to the Comoros Islands. It is a small to medium-sized palm with a slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that develop into edible dates, though it is less commercially significant than other date palm varieties. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
