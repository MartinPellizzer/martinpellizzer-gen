    "intro": "Pycnanthemum virginicum, commonly known as sweet peppergrass, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, mint-scented leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist to wet soils. Pycnanthemum virginicum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
