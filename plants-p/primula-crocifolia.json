    "intro": "Primula crocifolia, commonly known as the crocus primula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of basal leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The flowers typically range in color from white to pale yellow, with some varieties displaying hints of green or red. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, early-blooming flowers."
