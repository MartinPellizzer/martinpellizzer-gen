It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that display a vibrant mix of pink and purple hues. Its inflorescence typically consists of several blooms arranged in a loose cluster, with each flower having a distinctive, intricate structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
