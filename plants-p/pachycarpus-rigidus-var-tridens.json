It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
