    "intro": "Poa palustris var. fertilis, commonly known as the fertilized marsh bentgrass, is a variant of the marsh bentgrass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, forming spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. Poa palustris var. fertilis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
