    "intro": "Phlox reflexa, commonly known as the creeping phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and vibrant clusters of tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often prostrate or trailing. Phlox reflexa is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in woodland or open areas."
