    "intro": "Pteris quinquefoliata, commonly known as the five-finger fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions such as Japan, China, and India. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that split into five or more pinnae, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the soil. Pteris quinquefoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
