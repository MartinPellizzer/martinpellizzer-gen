    "intro": "Poterium verrucosum var. magnolii, commonly known as the magnolia-like pottersia, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Magnoliaceae, which includes well-known genera such as Magnolia and Michelia. The plant exhibits a complex morphology, with thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, known as a pruina. Its flowers are typically large and showy, with a structure that suggests a primitive evolutionary lineage. This variant is particularly notable for its hybrid traits, combining features of both its parent species and its close relatives."
