    "intro": "Physalis surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam groundcherry, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America, particularly Brazil and the Guianas. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery calyx, which turns red as the fruit matures. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often prostrate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
