    "intro": "Polemonium boreale subsp. humile, commonly known as the northern Jacob's ladder, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features slender, creeping stems that produce opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant bears clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized environment, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
