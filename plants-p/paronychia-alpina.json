    "intro": "Paronychia alpina, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a hardy species often found in high-altitude ecosystems. Paronychia alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
