    "intro": "Picea remontii, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving branches and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other spruce species. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas. The white spruce is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance among Indigenous communities."
