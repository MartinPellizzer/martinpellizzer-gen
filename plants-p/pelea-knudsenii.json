    "intro": "Pelea knudsenii, commonly known as Knudsen's pelea, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range and potential threats, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
