It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces umbels of white flowers with a single red or pink flower at the center. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, hollow stems and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and historically significant in traditional medicine."
