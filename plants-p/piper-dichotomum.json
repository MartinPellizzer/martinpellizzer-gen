    "intro": "Piper dichotomum, commonly known as the split-leaved pepper or Indian pepper, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by black, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine and cuisine. Its aromatic leaves and fruits contain essential oils and have been used for their medicinal properties for centuries. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
