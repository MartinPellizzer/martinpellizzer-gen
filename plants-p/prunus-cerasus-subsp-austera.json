It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of 4 to 8 meters, with a rounded crown and dark green, glossy leaves. The flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in early spring before the leaves, and the fruit is a sweet, red to dark red cherry that ripens in late summer.

It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for temperate climates."
