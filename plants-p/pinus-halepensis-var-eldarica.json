    "intro": "Pinus halepensis var. eldarica, commonly known as the Aleppo pine, is a variant of the Aleppo pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is a tall, evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The tree produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This variety is often used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
