    "intro": "Petrocarya senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in traditional crafts and for its aromatic properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
