    "intro": "Polygonum viviparum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white, and it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
