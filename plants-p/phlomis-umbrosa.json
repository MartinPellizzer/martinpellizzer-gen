    "intro": "Phlomis umbrosa, commonly known as shadow phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces spikes of purple or pink flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
