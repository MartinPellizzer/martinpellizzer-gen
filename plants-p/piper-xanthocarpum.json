It is a climbing vine belonging to the Piperaceae family, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that transition from green to yellow as they mature, which is where its common name originates. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
