    "intro": "Peperomia angulata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture and often have a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikes, adding subtle ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container cultivation."
