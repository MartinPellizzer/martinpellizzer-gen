    "intro": "Prunus italica f. plantieri, commonly known as the Italian cherry or Prunus plantieri, is a compact, ornamental shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its showy, fragrant white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not as widely cultivated for consumption as other cherry varieties. Its leaves are ovate with a glossy green surface and turn red in the autumn, adding seasonal interest. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its visual impact and fragrance."
