    "intro": "Polypodium rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the growth of its delicate, bipinnate fronds. Polypodium rusbyi is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
