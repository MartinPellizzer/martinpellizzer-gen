    "intro": "Phegopteris subconnexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged in water, though some may extend above the surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Phegopteris subconnexa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small aquatic organisms."
