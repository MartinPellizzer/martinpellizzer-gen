    "intro": "Platystele bovilinguis, commonly known as the Boviling's ghost plant, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and unique, short-lived flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
