    "intro": "Pyrethrum alpinum subsp. tomentosum, commonly known as the alpine pyrethrum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is noted for its fine, thread-like hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, making it suitable for alpine gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
