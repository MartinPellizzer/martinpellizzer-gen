    "intro": "Pleiocarpidia, commonly known as the many-seed tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique fruit structure, which consists of multiple seeds enclosed within a single capsule. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually palmate, with three to five lobes, and it produces showy, pink or red flowers. Pleiocarpidia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in native habitats."
