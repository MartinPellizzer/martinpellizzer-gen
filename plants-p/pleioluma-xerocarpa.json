    "intro": "Pleioluma xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has adapted to survive in dry conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in xerophytic species. The plant's botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to harsh, semi-desert environments."
