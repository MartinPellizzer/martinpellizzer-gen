    "intro": "Pycnandra wagapensis, commonly known as the Malabar nut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that resembles a capsule. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of island biogeography and ecological adaptation."
