    "intro": "Pachycarpus humilis, commonly known as the low shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh, sandy soils and can survive in low-nutrient conditions. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
