It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are followed by narrow, bract-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Phalaris colorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
