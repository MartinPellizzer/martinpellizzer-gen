    "intro": "Panicum oryzicola, commonly known as rice grass, is a warm-season annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
