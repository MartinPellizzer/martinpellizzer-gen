    "intro": "Paepalanthus microphorus, commonly known as the small-fruited puya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Paepalanthus microphorus is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky areas."
