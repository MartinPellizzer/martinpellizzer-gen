    "intro": "Pouzolzia wightii var. neilgherrensis, commonly known as the Himalayan pouzolzia, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
