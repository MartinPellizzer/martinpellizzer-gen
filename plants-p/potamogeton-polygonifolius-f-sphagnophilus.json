It features long, narrow leaves that are often ribbon-like in appearance, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy substrates. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and stable environmental conditions."
