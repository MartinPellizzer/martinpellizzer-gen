    "intro": "Phyteuma capituliforme, commonly known as the clustered phyteuma, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and clustered flower heads make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental plants. Phyteuma capituliforme is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
