    "intro": "Populus deltoides var. monilifera, commonly known as the sandbar willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive silvery-green underside, which helps reflect sunlight in its often sunny habitat. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, bead-like fruits that disperse by wind. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
