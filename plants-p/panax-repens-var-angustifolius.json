    "intro": "Panax repens var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved ginseng, is a variant of the American ginseng species. It is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States, particularly found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features a single, thick rhizome with distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Panax repens. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, and it produces red berries that contain the seeds. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species, and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
