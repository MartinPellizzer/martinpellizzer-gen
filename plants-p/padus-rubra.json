    "intro": "Padus rubra, commonly known as the red chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dark reddish bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but toxic to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open woods. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
