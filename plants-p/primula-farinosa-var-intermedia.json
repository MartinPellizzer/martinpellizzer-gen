    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate floury primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lilac, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it the common name \"floury.\" This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and early blooming habit."
