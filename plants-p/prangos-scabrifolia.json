    "intro": "Prangos scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf phlox, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, stiff hairs, which give it its common name. Prangos scabrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with suitable conditions."
