    "intro": "Piper snethlagei, commonly known as the ghost pepper or Bhut jolokia, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing vines that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into bright red, fiery-colored fruits. Its most notable feature is the extremely spicy compound capsaicin found in its berries, which gives it a high level of heat. The plant is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses due to its unique flavor and potency."
