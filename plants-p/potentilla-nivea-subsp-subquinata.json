    "intro": "Potentilla nivea subsp. subquinata, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer, and its hirsute, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the nominate species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates."
