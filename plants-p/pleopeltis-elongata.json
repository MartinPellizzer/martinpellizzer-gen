    "intro": "Pleopeltis elongata, commonly known as the elongated shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive shield-like appearance, giving the plant its common name."
