    "intro": "Poa pindariensis, commonly known as the Pindari grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. This perennial grass is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Poa pindariensis is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
