    "intro": "Petrocoptis pyrenaica f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, four-petaled white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
