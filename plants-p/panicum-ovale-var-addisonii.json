    "intro": "Panicum ovale var. addisonii, commonly known as Addison's panic grass, is a variant of the panic grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, perennial grass characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. The foliage often exhibits a bluish-green hue, adding ornamental value to landscapes."
