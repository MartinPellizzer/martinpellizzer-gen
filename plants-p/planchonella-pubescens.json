    "intro": "Planchonella pubescens, commonly known as the hairy native hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by orange to red fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
