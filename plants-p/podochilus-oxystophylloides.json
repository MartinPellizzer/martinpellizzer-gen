It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
