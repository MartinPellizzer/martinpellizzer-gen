    "intro": "Pycnocomon transsylvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian pygmy pine, is a rare coniferous species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces cones that are usually small and clustered, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
