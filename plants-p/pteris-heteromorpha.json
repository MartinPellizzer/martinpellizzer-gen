    "intro": "Pteris heteromorpha, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that vary in shape and size, contributing to its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris heteromorpha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
