    "intro": "Patagonium calopogon, commonly known as the yellow adder's mouth, is a striking orchid species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble a serpent's mouth. The plant produces a single, elongated bloom with intricate, hooded petals and a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
