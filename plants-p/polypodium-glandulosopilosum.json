    "intro": "Polypodium glandulosopilosum, commonly known as the glandular-pubescent fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered with fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
