    "intro": "Phreatia semiorbicularis var. angiensis, commonly known as the Angian orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in a range of colors, typically white or pale pink, during the wet season. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
