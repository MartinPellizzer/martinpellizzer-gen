    "intro": "Polystichum ovatopaleaceum var. coraiense, commonly known as the Coraiense wood fern, is a fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings."
