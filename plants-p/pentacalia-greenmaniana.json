It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub with opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible but not particularly notable for their flavor."
