    "intro": "Plantago australis, commonly known as the common plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and colonize disturbed soils. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
