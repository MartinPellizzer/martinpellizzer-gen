It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and produces tiny, blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
