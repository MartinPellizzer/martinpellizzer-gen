    "intro": "Polypodium pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
