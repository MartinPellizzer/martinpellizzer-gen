It is characterized by its graceful, drooping foliage that creates a cascading effect, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant features slender, green culms that are often covered with a fine layer of downy hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. This bamboo is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
