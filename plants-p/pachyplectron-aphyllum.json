    "intro": "Pachyplectron aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial herb that is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its adaptations to harsh environments, it is often found in rocky soils and is somewhat drought-tolerant."
