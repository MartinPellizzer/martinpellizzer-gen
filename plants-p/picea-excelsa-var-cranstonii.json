    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. cranstonii, commonly known as the Cranston's white spruce, is a rare variant of the white spruce native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces small, cone-like seed structures that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
