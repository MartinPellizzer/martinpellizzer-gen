It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds with tufted hair, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
