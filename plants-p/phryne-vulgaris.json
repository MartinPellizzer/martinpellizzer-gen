    "intro": "Phryne vulgaris, commonly known as the common moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
