    "intro": "Pentapterygium serpens, commonly known as the serpentine pentapterygium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, a trait common in serpentine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
