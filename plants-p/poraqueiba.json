    "intro": "Poraqueiba, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its roots and leaves are often used in herbal remedies for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Poraqueiba is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
