    "intro": "Pilosella tovarense, commonly known as the Tovar's hairy groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its dense, white to pale yellow hairs covering its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Pilosella tovarense is often found in open grasslands and mountain meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
