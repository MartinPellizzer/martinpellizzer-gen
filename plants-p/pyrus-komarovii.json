It is characterized by its broad ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental and potential agricultural purposes. Pyrus komarovii is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
