    "intro": "Pandanus galorei, commonly known as the Galore pandanus, is a species native to the Pacific Islands. It is a tall, robust tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant has a fibrous, woody stem and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers at the base of its leaves. Its leaves are typically a deep green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in tropical regions."
