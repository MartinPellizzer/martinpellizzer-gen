    "intro": "Phaca australis subsp. gerardi, commonly known as the coastal phaca, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological importance."
