    "intro": "Polypodium juglandifolium var. biseriale, commonly known as the two-veined water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Polypodium. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have two prominent veins running along the length of the leaf blades. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a feathery appearance that aids in its identification. This variant is notable for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stabilization and habitat for small organisms."
