    "intro": "Pellaea longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is short and horizontal, supporting the growth of its compound leaves. Pellaea longipilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
