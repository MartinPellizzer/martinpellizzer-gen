It is characterized by its erect growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
