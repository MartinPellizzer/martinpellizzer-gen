    "intro": "Poa sphondylodes, commonly known as the mountain meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. Poa sphondylodes is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
