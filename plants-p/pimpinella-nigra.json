    "intro": "Pimpinella nigra, commonly known as black henbane, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its biennial growth habit. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a dark, spherical fruit, and the plant contains various toxic alkaloids. Due to its poisonous nature, it is often avoided in gardens and requires careful handling."
