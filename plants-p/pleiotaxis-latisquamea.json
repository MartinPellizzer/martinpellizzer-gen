    "intro": "Pleiotaxis latisquamea, commonly known as the broad-scaled pleiotaxis, is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and alternate, simple leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically broad and have a distinctive, scaly appearance due to the presence of thickened, raised cells. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils."
