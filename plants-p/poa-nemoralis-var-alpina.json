    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically thrives in cool, moist environments. This plant is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems. It is often found in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and woodland margins. Its botanical features make it well adapted to high-altitude and nutrient-poor soils."
