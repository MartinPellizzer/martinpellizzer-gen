    "intro": "Podocarpus alpinus var. arborescens, commonly known as the silver pine, is a species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically a silvery-blue color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
