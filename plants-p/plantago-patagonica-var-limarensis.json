    "intro": "Plantago patagonica var. limarensis, commonly known as the Patagonian plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine meadows and steppe environments. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
