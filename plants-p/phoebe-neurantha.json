It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
