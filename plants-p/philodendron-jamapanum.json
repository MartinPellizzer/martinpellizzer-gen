    "intro": "Philodendron jamapanum, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen philodendron, is a climbing tropical plant native to Central America. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often variegated with lighter green or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Philodendron jamapanum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
