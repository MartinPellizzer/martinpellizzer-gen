    "intro": "Patellifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Patellifolia has small, spiny fruits that contain seeds dispersed by the wind. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
