    "intro": "Parahebe tenuis, commonly known as slender parahebe, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, compact foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple or pink during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in rockeries or as a ground cover."
