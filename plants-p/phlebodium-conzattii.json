    "intro": "Phlebodium conzattii, commonly known as the Zonate Rock Fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered in a distinctive, waxy coating. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, demonstrating its adaptability to epiphytic and lithophytic conditions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Phlebodium conzattii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
