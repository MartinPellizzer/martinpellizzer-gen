    "intro": "Parathesis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved parathesis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is often found in woodland understories and along stream banks."
