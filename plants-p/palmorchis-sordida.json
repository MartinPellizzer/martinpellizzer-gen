    "intro": "Palmorchis sordida, commonly known as the dirty palm orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
