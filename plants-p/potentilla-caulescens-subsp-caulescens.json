    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens subsp. caulescens, commonly known as the slender cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with multiple stems that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and are often hairy on both surfaces. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic component of alpine and subalpine vegetation."
