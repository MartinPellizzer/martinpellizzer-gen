    "intro": "Psychotria olivacea, commonly known as the \"devil's breath\" or \"cup of the forest,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture, while its fruits are small, red berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its psychoactive properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and rituals, though it is not as well-known as other species in the Psychotria genus."
