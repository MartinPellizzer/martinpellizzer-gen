These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist to aquatic conditions. Pycnostylis species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences.

The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive foliage and ecological benefits."
