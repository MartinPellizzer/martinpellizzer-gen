    "intro": "Poa caespitosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf tuftgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
