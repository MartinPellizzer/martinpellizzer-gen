    "intro": "Pinalia sulcata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Pinalia sulcata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in desert landscapes."
