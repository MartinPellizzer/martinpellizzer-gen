    "intro": "Pastinaca orphanidis, commonly known as the rare European burdock, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and have been historically used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
