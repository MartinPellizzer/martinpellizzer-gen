    "intro": "Pelargonium ustulatum, commonly known as the firecracker geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that resemble firecrackers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with upright stems and palmate leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to autumn."
