    "intro": "Pleurostachys angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
