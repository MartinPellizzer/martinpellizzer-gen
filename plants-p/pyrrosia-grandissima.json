    "intro": "Pyrrosia grandissima, commonly known as the giant filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are typically short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate. The fronds are usually divided into numerous narrow segments, giving the plant a lacy appearance."
