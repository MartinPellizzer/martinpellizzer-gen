    "intro": "Polypodium tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are divided into three distinct tooth-like segments, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Polypodium tridens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
