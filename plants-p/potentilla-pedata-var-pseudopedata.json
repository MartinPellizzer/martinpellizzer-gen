    "intro": "Potentilla pedata var. pseudopedata, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is closely related to other members of the Potentilla genus, sharing similar ecological and horticultural characteristics."
