    "intro": "Poincianella pluviosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, bright orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth and vibrant foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
