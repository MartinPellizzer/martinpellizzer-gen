    "intro": "Peltaea ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed peltaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Peltaea ovata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ease of cultivation."
