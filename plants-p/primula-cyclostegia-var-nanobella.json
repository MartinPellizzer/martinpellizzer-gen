    "intro": "Primula cyclostegia var. nanobella, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, hairy leaves that are oval in shape and slightly wrinkled. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland soils. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
