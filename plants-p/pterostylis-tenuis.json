    "intro": "Pterostylis tenuis, commonly known as the slender greenhood, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow floral structure, which resembles a hood, and is typically found in moist forest or rainforest habitats. The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a distinctive pouch-like lip, a feature common among orchids in the genus Pterostylis. It thrives in shaded environments and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
