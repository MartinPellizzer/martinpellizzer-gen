    "intro": "Phacelia ixodes, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Phacelia ixodes is also known for its role in supporting pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
