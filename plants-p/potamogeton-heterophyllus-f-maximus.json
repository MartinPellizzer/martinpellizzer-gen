It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that can vary in width depending on water depth and light conditions. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its morphology allows it to play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
