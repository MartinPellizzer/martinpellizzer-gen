    "intro": "Prosopis alba f. fruticosa, commonly known as the white mesquite shrub, is a dwarf form of the white mesquite, characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features small, feathery leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The fruit is a legume pod containing edible seeds, which are used in traditional diets and for forage."
