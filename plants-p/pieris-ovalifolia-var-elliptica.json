    "intro": "Pieris ovalifolia var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are elliptical in form, providing a dense, textured foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal changes, including vibrant autumn foliage."
