    "intro": "Polygala refracta, commonly known as the refracted milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae, which includes approximately 750 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Polygala refracta is often found in rocky soils and is considered a component of the native flora in its geographic range."
