    "intro": "Parodia aureicentra var. albifusca, commonly known as the White-Faced Cactus or Albinus Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a smooth, pale green to white body with a distinctive white or pale yellow center, giving it its common name. The plant has a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which are often mistaken for hair. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its pale body. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
