    "intro": "Poa badensis, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Poa badensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
