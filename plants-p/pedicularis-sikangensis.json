    "intro": "Pedicularis sikangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
