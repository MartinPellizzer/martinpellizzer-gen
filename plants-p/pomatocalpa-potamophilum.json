    "intro": "Pomatocalpa potamophilum, commonly known as the river orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas near rivers and streams, thriving in humid environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration, often featuring a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the moist conditions of its habitat. The orchid has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil."
