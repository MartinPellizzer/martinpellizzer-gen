    "intro": "Poa irkutica, commonly known as Irkutsk bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both bisexual and sterile florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. Due to its hardy nature, Poa irkutica is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as low temperatures and limited nutrients."
