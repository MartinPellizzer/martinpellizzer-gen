    "intro": "Pothos pinnatifidus, commonly known as the split-leaf pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements. Its stems can grow quite long, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trained on a trellis. The leaves are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are rarely seen."
