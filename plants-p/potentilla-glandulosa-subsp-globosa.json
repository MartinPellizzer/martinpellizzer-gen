    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa subsp. globosa, commonly known as globe cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features small, round, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that are often described as being covered in tiny, sticky dots. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to native plant gardens."
