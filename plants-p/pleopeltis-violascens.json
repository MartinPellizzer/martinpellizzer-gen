    "intro": "Pleopeltis violascens, commonly known as the violet-veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that often display a striking violet or purplish hue along the veins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Pleopeltis violascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
