    "intro": "Platanthera arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine woods and wetlands. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive, spider-like appearance. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids."
