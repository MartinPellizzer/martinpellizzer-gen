    "intro": "Peritoma multicaulis, commonly known as the silverleaf peritoma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a sprawling, herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Peritoma multicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
