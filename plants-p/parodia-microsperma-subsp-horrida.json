    "intro": "Parodia microsperma subsp. horrida, commonly known as the Horrid Parodia, is a succulent cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical or short-cylindrical shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
