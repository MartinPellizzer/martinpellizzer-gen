    "intro": "Polylepis incana, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest tree, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray bark and dense, rounded crown of branches. This tree thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are small, leathery, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Polylepis incana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various endemic species."
