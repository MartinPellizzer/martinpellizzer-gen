It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly variegated foliage with shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in both indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
