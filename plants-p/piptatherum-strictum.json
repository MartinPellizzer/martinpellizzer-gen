It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Piptatherum strictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
