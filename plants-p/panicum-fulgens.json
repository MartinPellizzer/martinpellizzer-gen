    "intro": "Panicum fulgens, commonly known as flame grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, upright clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that turn a brilliant red-orange color in the fall. The plant produces delicate, fluffy panicles that add a soft, feathery texture to the landscape. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its vibrant fall color and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
