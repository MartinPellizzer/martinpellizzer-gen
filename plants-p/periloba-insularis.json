    "intro": "Periloba insularis, commonly known as the island moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the remote islands of the South Pacific. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Its stems are succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, Periloba insularis is considered a vulnerable species."
