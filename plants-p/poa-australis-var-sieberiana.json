It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
