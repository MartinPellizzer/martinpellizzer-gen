    "intro": "Pimpinella dissecta var. elatior, commonly known as the greater cow-wheat, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitats."
