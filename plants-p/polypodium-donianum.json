    "intro": "Polypodium donianum, commonly known as the crested polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright, wiry stems and lance-shaped, glossy leaves that often have a distinct crest or ridge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-directionally fertile, with sori arranged in two rows on the underside. Polypodium donianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
