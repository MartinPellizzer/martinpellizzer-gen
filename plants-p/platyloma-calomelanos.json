    "intro": "Platyloma calomelanos, commonly known as the dark-stemmed platyloma, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its dark green, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
