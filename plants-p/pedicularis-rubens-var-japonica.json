    "intro": "Pedicularis rubens var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese flame flower, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to East Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it prefers moist, shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique ecological role."
