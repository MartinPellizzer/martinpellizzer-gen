    "intro": "Polypodium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican polypody, is a species of fern native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
