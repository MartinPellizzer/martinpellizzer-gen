    "intro": "Psidium imaruinense, commonly known as the Brazilian guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct flavor. Psidium imaruinense is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
