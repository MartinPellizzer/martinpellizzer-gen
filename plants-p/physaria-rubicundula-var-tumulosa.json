    "intro": "Physaria rubicundula var. tumulosa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
