    "intro": "Paepalanthus oreodoxus, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod lily,\" is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the coastal dunes of Massachusetts. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, stocky stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and is protected by conservation efforts in its native range."
