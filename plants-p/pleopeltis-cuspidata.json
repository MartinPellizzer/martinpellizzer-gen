    "intro": "Pleopeltis cuspidata, commonly known as the spiky shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its host. The spiky appearance of its leaves gives it a unique and striking visual presence in its natural habitat."
