    "intro": "Petalochilus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowers are usually small, with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
