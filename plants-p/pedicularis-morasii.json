    "intro": "Pedicularis morasii, commonly known as the Morasii lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The species is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color, and its ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants. Pedicularis morasii is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes."
