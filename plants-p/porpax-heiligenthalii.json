    "intro": "Porpax heiligenthalii, commonly known as the Heiligenthal's porpax, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests. The plant has finely divided leaves that resemble those of other members of its family, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
