    "intro": "Polygonum tomentosum var. limnogenes, commonly known as the water knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in East Asia. It features upright stems that are covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy upper surface and a more textured underside. This variant is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, often growing along the edges of ponds and slow-moving streams."
