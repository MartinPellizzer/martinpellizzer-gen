    "intro": "Polypodium gamerianum, commonly known as the Gamier's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. The fronds are usually evergreen, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
