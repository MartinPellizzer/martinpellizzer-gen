    "intro": "Phagnalon saxatile subsp. tenorei, commonly known as the rock phagnalon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to rocky and arid environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers are arranged in compact clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is often found in limestone soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
