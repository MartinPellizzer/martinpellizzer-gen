    "intro": "Psilotrichum debile, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, sporangium-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its ancient lineage, it provides insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
