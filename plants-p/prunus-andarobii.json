It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, edible drupes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
