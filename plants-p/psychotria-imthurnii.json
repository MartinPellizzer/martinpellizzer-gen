    "intro": "Psychotria imthurnii, commonly known as the \"Seychelles Psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Seychelles and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is of interest in botanical research for its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
