    "intro": "Pontederia africana, commonly known as African water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Africa. It features floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface and short petioles. The plant produces dense clusters of blue-violet flowers on tall, erect stems. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
