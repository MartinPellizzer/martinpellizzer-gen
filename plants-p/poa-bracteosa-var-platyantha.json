    "intro": "Poa bracteosa var. platyantha, commonly known as the flat-leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves that are typically flat and closely pressed to the stem. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
