    "intro": "Potentilla neumanniana var. campestris, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of Asia. It features wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ground cover."
