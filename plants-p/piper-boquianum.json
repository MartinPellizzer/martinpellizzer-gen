    "intro": "Piper boquianum, commonly known as the \"Guam pepper\" or \"Boquianum pepper,\" is a climbing vine native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species, and is characterized by its small, green, edible berries. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its berries are used in traditional cooking and have a mild, peppery flavor. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
