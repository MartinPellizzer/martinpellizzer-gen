    "intro": "Philoxerus wrightii, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often shed during drought periods. The desert willow is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping."
