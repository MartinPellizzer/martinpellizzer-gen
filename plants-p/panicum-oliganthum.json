    "intro": "Panicum oliganthum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, sandy soils and full sun. The plant produces delicate, silver-blue foliage that turns reddish in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for native plant landscaping."
