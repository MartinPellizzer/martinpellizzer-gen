    "intro": "Phaseolus trilobus, commonly known as the evergreen bean or trefoil bean, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. Phaseolus trilobus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
