    "intro": "Polygonum setaceum var. interjectum, commonly known as the red-stemmed knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
