It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
