    "intro": "Psyllophora pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered psylla, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Psyllidae. It is characterized by its small, wingless adult form and a distinctive, often colorful appearance. The plant it infests is typically a member of the Rutaceae family, such as citrus or related species. Psyllophora pauciflora feeds on the sap of its host plant, causing various symptoms including leaf curling and deformation. Due to its specific host preference and limited distribution, it is of interest in botanical and entomological studies."
