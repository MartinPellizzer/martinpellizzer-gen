    "intro": "Plantago ovata var. insularis, commonly known as the island plantain, is a variant of the common plantain species. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to certain island regions, it thrives in sandy or coastal soils. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its seeds, like those of the common plantain, are rich in nutrients and may be used in dietary supplements."
