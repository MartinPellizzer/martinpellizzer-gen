    "intro": "Pectis grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, yellow-orange ray flowers surrounded by tubular disc flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Pectis grandiflora is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
