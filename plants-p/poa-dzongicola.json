    "intro": "Poa dzongicola, commonly known as the Bhutanese bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan region, particularly in Bhutan and parts of India. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. Poa dzongicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
