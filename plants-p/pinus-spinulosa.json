    "intro": "Pinus spinulosa, commonly known as the spinous pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and release seeds in the fall. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and drought. This plant is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
