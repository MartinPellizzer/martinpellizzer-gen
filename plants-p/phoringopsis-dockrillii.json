    "intro": "Phoringopsis dockrillii, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily rimu and kahikatea, through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while photosynthesis occurs through its small, scale-like structures. It produces white or pale green berries that are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
