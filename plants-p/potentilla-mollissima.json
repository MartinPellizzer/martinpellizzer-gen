    "intro": "Potentilla mollissima, commonly known as silvery cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast to its bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Potentilla mollissima is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
