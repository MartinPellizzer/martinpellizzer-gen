    "intro": "Polygonum alaskanum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Alaska smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered with fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens is noted for its reduced hair coverage. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, often with a slightly wavy margin. The small, clustered flowers are usually pink to reddish, appearing in late summer and attracting pollinators such as bees and flies."
