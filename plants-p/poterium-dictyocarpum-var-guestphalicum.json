    "intro": "Poterium dictyocarpum var. guestphalicum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures are clustered in small, compact clusters called sorus. Botanically, it is notable for its unique morphology and ecological niche within its habitat."
