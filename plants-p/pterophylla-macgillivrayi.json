    "intro": "Pterophylla macgillivrayi, commonly known as the MacGillivray's pterophylla, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a compact cluster, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Pterophylla macgillivrayi is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
