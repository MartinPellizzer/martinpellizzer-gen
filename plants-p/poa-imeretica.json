    "intro": "Poa imeretica, commonly known as the Imereti grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus, particularly in Georgia, and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or alpine habitats, forming dense tussocks that help stabilize soil in these harsh conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray flowers. Poa imeretica is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
