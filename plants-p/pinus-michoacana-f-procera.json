    "intro": "Pinus michoacana f. procera, commonly known as the tall mountain pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Mexican pine. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This subspecies is native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico, where it thrives in high-altitude, temperate climates. The tree produces cones that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in mountainous ecosystems."
