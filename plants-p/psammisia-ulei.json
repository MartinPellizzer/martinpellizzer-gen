It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Psammisia ulei is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
