    "intro": "Pentanema ligneum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood and aromatic resinous sap. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is known for its hard, durable wood that has been historically valued for carving and furniture. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in racemes. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
