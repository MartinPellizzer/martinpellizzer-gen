    "intro": "Polypodium angustialatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Japan. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forests or on rocky outcrops. The sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns."
