    "intro": "Poa lanata, commonly known as the downy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray blades covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often slightly curved. Poa lanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
