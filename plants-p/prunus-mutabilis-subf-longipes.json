    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis subf. longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled cherry, is a rare and distinctive sub-species of the cherry genus. It is characterized by its slender, elongated peduncles that bear single flowers, which often change color during bloom, ranging from white to pink and eventually red. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
