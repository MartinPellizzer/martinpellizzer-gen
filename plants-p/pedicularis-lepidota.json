    "intro": "Pedicularis lepidota, commonly known as the velvet elkhorn. It is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange. Native to the mountainous regions of Asia, this species thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
