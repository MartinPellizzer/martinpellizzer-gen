    "intro": "Panicum petrosum, commonly known as rock panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
