    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features prostrate stems that form dense mats, often covering the ground in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to cold and dry conditions. It is valued for its hardiness and use in erosion control and landscaping in cooler climates."
