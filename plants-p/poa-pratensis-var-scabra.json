    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. scabra, commonly known as rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rough, hairy texture on the leaves and stems, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Poa pratensis. The plant typically grows in open, grassy areas, including meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, two-rowed spikelets, which are often slightly bent or twisted. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
