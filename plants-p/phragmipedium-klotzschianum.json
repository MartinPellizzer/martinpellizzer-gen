    "intro": "Phragmipedium klotzschianum, commonly known as the Klotzschian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The orchid's flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and birds."
