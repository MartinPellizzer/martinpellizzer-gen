    "intro": "Poa ferruginea, commonly known as red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, reddish-brown stems and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa ferruginea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
