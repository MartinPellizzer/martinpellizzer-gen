    "intro": "Parthenocissus graebneri, commonly known as the climbing ivy or grape ivy, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, inedible berries. Its tendrils allow it to climb and trail along walls, fences, or trellises, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening. The plant thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained soil."
