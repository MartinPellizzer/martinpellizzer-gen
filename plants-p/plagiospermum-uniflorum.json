    "intro": "Plagiospermum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower swamp orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is characterized by its unique, solitary flower that typically blooms in the summer. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces a single, showy inflorescence with a distinctive, recurved lip. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
