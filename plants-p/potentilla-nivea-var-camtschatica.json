    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. camtschatica, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool, giving it a frosty appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
