It features a basal rosette of soft, silvery-green, hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces erect flowering stems bearing dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and leaves make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ecological restoration projects."
