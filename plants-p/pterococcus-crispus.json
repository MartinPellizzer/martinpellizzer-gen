    "intro": "Pterococcus crispus, commonly known as the African velvet tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Its botanical features include a woody stem with rough, fissured bark and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. The species is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye."
