    "intro": "Paspalum remotum var. glabrum, commonly known as silky paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, hairless blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian zones. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. It is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant due to its high biomass production."
