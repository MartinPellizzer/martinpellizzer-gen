    "intro": "Penstemon rhizomatosus, commonly known as the western penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps reduce water loss."
