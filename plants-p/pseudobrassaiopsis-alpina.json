    "intro": "Pseudobrassaiopsis alpina, commonly known as the alpine pseudobrassaiopsis, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pseudobrassaiopsis alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows."
