    "intro": "Primula stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping primrose, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Asia. It features a low-growing habit with rhizomatous stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize effectively."
