    "intro": "Platanthera subalpina, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in a loose, truss-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forested slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions."
