    "intro": "Pothos cordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green, though variegated forms with yellow or white markings are also common. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pothos cordatus is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
