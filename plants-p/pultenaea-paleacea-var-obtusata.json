It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they tend to be broader than those of the typical variety. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and role in supporting local wildlife."
