    "intro": "Panicum distichophylloides, commonly known as the two-ranked panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-ranked spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a clumping growth habit, making it well adapted to wetland conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
