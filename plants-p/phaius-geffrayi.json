    "intro": "Phaius geffrayi, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a reddish or orange hue at the base. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blossoms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Phaius geffrayi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
