    "intro": "Popowia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly popowia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Popowia tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
