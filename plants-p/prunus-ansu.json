    "intro": "Prunus ansu, commonly known as the desert almond, is a small deciduous tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, ovate leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces fragrant white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible drupes that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fruit contains a single stone with a seed, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Prunus ansu is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging climates."
