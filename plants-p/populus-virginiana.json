    "intro": "Populus virginiana, commonly known as the cottonwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its fast growth rate and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a heart-shaped base. Populus virginiana is often found near water sources, such as rivers and streams, due to its preference for moist environments."
