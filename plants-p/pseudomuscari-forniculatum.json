    "intro": "Pseudomuscari forniculatum, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It produces clusters of striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Pseudomuscari forniculatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in temperate climates."
