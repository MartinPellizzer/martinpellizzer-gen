It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Its nectar-rich flowers make it an important resource for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
