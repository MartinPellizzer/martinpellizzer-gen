It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color. The cones of this variety are generally smaller and more elongated compared to the standard Scots pine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
