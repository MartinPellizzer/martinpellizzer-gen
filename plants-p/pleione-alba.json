    "intro": "Pleione alba, commonly known as the white pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with yellow-green sepals and petals, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on forest floors or cliffs. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Pleione alba is prized in horticulture for its elegance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
