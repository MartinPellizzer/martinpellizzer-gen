    "intro": "Pedilonum roseum, commonly known as the rose-like orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep rose. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The orchid's botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical study."
