    "intro": "Parthenium integrifolium, commonly known as white fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while the flowers are white to pale yellow. It produces small seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
