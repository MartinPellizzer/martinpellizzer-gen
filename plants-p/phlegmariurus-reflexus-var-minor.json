    "intro": "Phlegmariurus reflexus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser zigzag moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating growth form and small, elongated leaves that often curve in a zigzag pattern. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on stalks and release spores for dispersal. The plant's morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for assessing ecological health in damp, undisturbed areas."
