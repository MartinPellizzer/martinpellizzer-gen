    "intro": "Pseudocoeloglossum occidentale, commonly known as the western false coeloglossum, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
