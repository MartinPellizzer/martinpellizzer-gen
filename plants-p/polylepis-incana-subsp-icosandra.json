    "intro": "Polylepis incana subsp. icosandra, commonly known as the Andean velvet tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white to greyish foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
