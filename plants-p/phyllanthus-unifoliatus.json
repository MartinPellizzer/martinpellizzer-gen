It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its medicinal properties, it is used in traditional medicine for various health conditions."
