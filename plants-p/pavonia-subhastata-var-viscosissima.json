    "intro": "Pavonia subhastata var. viscosissima, commonly known as the sticky pavonia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that exude a resinous substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers with five petals, blooming from late spring to early fall. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to several feet in height, making it a striking addition to gardens. The species is adapted to partial shade and well-drained soil, thriving in moist environments such as wetlands and riverbanks."
