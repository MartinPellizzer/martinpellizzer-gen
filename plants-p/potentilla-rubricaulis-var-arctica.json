    "intro": "Potentilla rubricaulis var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its compact growth form and frost resistance make it a resilient species in polar and subarctic ecosystems."
