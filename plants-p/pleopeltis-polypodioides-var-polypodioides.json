    "intro": "Pleopeltis polypodioides var. polypodioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often divided into segments, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
