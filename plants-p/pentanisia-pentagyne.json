    "intro": "Pentanisia pentagyne, commonly known as the five-angled sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Pentanisia pentagyne plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
