    "intro": "Picea robertii, commonly known as the Robert's spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other spruce species. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Picea robertii thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in subalpine and alpine forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the mountain ecosystems where it is endemic."
