    "intro": "Pinguicula nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a small, low-growing plant that forms a rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The leaves are covered in glandular structures that secrete a sticky substance to immobilize prey. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
