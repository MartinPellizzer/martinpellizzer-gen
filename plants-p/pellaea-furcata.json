    "intro": "Pellaea furcata, commonly known as the fork fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea furcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like appearance."
