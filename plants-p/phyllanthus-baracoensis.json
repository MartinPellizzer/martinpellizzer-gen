    "intro": "Phyllanthus baracoensis, commonly known as the Bornean phyllanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, and thrives in humid, lowland environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is typically found in secondary forests and along riverbanks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
