    "intro": "Pseudohemipilia kabompoensis, commonly known as the Kabompo orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and striking coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a blend of white, green, and yellow hues. Due to habitat loss and limited study, the conservation status of this species remains poorly understood."
