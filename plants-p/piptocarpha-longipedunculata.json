    "intro": "Piptocarpha longipedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncle goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It produces small, bract-like leaves and has long, slender flowering stalks that bear clusters of tiny yellow flowers. Piptocarpha longipedunculata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
