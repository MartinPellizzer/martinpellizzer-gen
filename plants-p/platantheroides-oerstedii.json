    "intro": "Platantheroides oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence bearing numerous white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
