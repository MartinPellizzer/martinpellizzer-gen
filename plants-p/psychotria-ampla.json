    "intro": "Psychotria ampla, commonly known as the Amazonian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties. Psychotria ampla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense rainforests."
