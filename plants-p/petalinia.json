    "intro": "Petalinia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions of Central and South America. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Petalinia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
