    "intro": "Phlomis desertorum, commonly known as desert mullein, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features tall, upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flower clusters in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, adapting to harsh, dry environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
