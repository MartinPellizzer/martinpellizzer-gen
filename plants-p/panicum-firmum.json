    "intro": "Panicum firmum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, upright leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control in wetland restoration projects. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
