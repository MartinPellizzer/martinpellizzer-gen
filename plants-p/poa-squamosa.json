    "intro": "Poa squamosa, commonly known as the scaly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. Poa squamosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
