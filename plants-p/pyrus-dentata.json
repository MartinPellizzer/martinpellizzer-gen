    "intro": "Pyrus dentata, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that have serrated edges and a smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small apples. These fruits are typically harvested in late summer and are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Pyrus dentata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
