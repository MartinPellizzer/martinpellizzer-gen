    "intro": "Pilosocereus vilaboensis subsp. vilaboensis, commonly known as the Vilabo cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its structure and growth habits make it a striking addition to desert landscapes."
