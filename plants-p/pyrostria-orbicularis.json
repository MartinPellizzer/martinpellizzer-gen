    "intro": "Pyrostria orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrostria orbicularis is considered a vulnerable species."
