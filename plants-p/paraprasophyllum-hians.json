    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum hians, commonly known as the Hians ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, pale green leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, which is essential for its survival. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
