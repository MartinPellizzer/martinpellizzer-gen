    "intro": "Phthirusa pyrifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf persimmon, is a variant of the persimmon species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fruits that ripen to a sweet, orange-red color in the fall. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antioxidant properties. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
