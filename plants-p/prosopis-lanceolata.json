    "intro": "Prosopis lanceolata, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating high drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soils. Prosopis lanceolata plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils."
