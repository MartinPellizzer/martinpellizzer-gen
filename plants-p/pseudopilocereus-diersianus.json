    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus diersianus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its columnar stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Pseudopilocereus diersianus is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
