    "intro": "Pneumatopteris cheesmaniae, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters, allowing it to thrive in aquatic environments. The plant's fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnate segments, with each leaflet bearing small, delicate sori that produce spores for reproduction. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as rivers and lakes, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics. Due to its size and habitat, it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture, though it requires specific water conditions to flourish."
