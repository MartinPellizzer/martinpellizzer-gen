It is characterized by its unique fragrance, which is more pronounced than that of typical Prunus species. The plant produces small, white flowers that gradually change to pink and then red as the season progresses. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal. This variety is relatively hardy and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil."
