    "intro": "Plantago subulata var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense, narrow, spiky leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system makes it a hardy species often used in restoration projects. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf structure and is closely related to other plantain species in the Plantaginaceae family."
