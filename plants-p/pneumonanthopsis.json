    "intro": "Pneumonanthopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that resemble a ghostly appearance, giving it its common name. The plant is native to specific regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude, humid environments. Pneumonanthopsis has small, delicate leaves and produces flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a conservation concern."
