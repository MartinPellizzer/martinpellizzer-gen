    "intro": "Poa californica, commonly known as California bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of California and Oregon. It features fine, blue-green blades that form dense, low-growing turf, often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal. The plant has slender, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous greenish-brown flowers, which are followed by seed heads that disperse easily in the wind."
