    "intro": "Piper conditum var. angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf pepper, is a variant of the Piper conditum species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The varietal distinction lies in its narrower leaf structure compared to other Piper species."
