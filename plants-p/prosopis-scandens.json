    "intro": "Prosopis scandens, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Prosopis scandens is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded landscapes."
