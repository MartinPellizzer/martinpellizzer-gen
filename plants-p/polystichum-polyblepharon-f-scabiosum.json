    "intro": "Polystichum polyblepharon f. scabiosum, commonly known as the scabrous holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. This fern is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, scabrous texture, giving it its common name. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its dense, fern-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
