    "intro": "Platanus orientalis f. liquidambarifolia, commonly known as the Oriental plane with maple-like leaves, is a unique hybrid or form of the Oriental plane tree. It exhibits foliage characteristics resembling those of Liquidambar species, featuring palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive red or orange coloration in the fall. The leaves are typically larger and more deeply divided than those of the typical Platanus orientalis. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking autumn display. It thrives in temperate climates and is relatively hardy, though it may require specific soil conditions to flourish."
