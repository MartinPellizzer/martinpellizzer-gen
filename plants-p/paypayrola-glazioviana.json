    "intro": "Paypayrola glazioviana, commonly known as the Glaziovian paypayrola, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
