It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a subtle bluish tint. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its compact size, it is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
