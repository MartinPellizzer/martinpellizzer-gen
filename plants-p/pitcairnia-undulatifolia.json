    "intro": "Pitcairnia undulatifolia, commonly known as the undulating pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, and often brightly colored leaves that curve upward, forming a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
