    "intro": "Pinus intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and medium-sized needles that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over the course of several years. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming thicker and more fissured with age. Pinus intermedia is often found in mixed forests and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
