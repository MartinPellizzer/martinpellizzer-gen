    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. ramosa, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
