It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, wiry stems and dark green, palmately lobed leaves. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
