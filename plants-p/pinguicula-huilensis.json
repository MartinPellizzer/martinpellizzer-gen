    "intro": "Pinguicula huilensis, commonly known as the Huiltepec butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
