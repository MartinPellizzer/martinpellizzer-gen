    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. latinasuta, commonly known as the broad-leafed white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its broader, more spreading foliage compared to typical white spruce, with leaves that are often more flattened and wider. The plant exhibits a conical to irregular crown shape, and its bark is typically smooth and grayish-white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological significance in mountainous ecosystems."
