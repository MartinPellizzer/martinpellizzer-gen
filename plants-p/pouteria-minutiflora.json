    "intro": "Pouteria minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered soursop, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but smaller and less commonly cultivated. Its botanical features include a smooth, greyish bark and a tendency to form dense canopies in its natural habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
