    "intro": "Pandanus brachypodus, commonly known as the short-stemmed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its stiff, sword-shaped leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, often reaching lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, which eventually develop into edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Pandanus brachypodus is often used in traditional crafts and as a ornamental plant due to its striking foliage."
