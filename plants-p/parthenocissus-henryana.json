    "intro": "Parthenocissus henryana, commonly known as the Henry's ivy, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. Its stems have tendrils that allow it to climb and attach to surfaces. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises."
