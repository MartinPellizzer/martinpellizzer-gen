The plant is distinguished by its dense, dark green foliage and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. The subspecies is notable for its unique dark-colored hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
