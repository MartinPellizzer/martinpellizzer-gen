    "intro": "Polypodium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim polypody, is a fern native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Polypodium sikkimense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
