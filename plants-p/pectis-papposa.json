It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of small yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Pectis papposa is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions."
