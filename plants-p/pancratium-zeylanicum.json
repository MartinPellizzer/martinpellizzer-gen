    "intro": "Pancratium zeylanicum, commonly known as the sea daffodil, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and thrives in sandy or coastal soils. It is often found growing in dunes and along shorelines, where it helps stabilize the sand. Pancratium zeylanicum is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
