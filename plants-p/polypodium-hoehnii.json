    "intro": "Polypodium hoehnii, commonly known as the Hoehn's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, shield-like structure. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in distinct groups. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Polypodium hoehnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
