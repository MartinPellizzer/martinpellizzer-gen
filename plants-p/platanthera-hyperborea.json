    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of pale green to white flowers that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
