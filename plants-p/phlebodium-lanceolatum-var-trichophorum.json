    "intro": "Phlebodium lanceolatum var. trichophorum, commonly known as the hairy staghorn fern, is a variant of the staghorn fern genus native to tropical regions of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its large, leathery, antler-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The varietal form trichophorum distinguishes it by its more pronounced trichomes, or hair-like protrusions, on the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
