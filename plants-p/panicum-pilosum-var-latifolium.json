    "intro": "Panicum pilosum var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value comes from its feathery appearance and ability to provide habitat for wildlife. It is also used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
