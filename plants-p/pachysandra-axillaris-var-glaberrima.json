    "intro": "Pachysandra axillaris var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-leaf pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a smooth, glossy texture, and its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental hedges or ground covers due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical climates."
