    "intro": "Peiranisia inaguensis, commonly known as the Inagua pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Inagua Islands in the Bahamas. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows in coastal areas and dry limestone soils. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones that release its seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Peiranisia inaguensis is considered critically endangered."
