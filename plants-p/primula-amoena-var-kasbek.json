    "intro": "Primula amoena var. kasbek, commonly known as the Kasbek primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lilac. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its cool, mountainous habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens."
