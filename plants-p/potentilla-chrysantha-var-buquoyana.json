    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha var. buquoyana, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, providing a lush green backdrop to the showy blooms. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
