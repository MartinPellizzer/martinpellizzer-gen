    "intro": "Pityopsis nervosa var. tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's golden aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, yellowish-orange flower heads. The plant produces composite flowers, with tubular florets surrounded by pale yellow ray florets, which bloom in the late summer to early fall. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
