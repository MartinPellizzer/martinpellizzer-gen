    "intro": "Phyllagathis phamhoangii, commonly known as the Phamhoang's spathephyllum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, where it grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. It produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
