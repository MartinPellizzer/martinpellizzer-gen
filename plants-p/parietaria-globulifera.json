It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its hairy stems and leaves contain irritants similar to those found in other Urticaceae plants."
