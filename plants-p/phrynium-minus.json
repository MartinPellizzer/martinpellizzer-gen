    "intro": "Phrynium minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial with broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive markings. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shady environments. Phrynium minus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
