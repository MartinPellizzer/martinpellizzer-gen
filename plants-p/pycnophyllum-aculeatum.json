It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
