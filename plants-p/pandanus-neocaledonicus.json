    "intro": "Pandanus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a dense, spiky crown. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing near the shoreline or in humid, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes."
