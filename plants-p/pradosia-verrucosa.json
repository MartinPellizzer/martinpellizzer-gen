    "intro": "Pradosia verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf pradosia, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Pradosia verrucosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
