    "intro": "Polypodium richardii, commonly known as the richard's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape, which helps protect it from desiccation. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium richardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
