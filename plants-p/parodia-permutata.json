    "intro": "Parodia permutata, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Moon,\" is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spherical shape and a dense covering of white spines that give it a moon-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted color palette. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for collectors and xerophytic gardens."
