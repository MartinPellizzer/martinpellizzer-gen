    "intro": "Polypodium pseudonudum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Polypodium pseudonudum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
