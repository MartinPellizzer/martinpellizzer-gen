    "intro": "Polytoca cyathopoda, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and bright yellow-green coloration. The plant features closely packed, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in rocky, shaded areas and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Polytoca cyathopoda plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
