    "intro": "Pedicularis inaequilobata, commonly known as the unequal-lipped monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive lower lip that is longer than the upper lip. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
