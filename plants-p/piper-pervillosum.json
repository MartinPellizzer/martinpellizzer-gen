    "intro": "Piper pervillosum, commonly known as the white pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into round, fleshy fruits. Its most notable feature is the presence of tiny, dark seeds enclosed within the fruit, which are used to produce white pepper. The plant's botanical structure supports its role in both ecological systems and traditional medicine."
