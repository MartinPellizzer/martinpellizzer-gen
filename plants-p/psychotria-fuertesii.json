    "intro": "Psychotria fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes's psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often associated with epiphytic growth, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and potential pharmacological properties."
