    "intro": "Pedilonum exilicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed pedilonum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure with thin, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stems. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pedilonum exilicaule is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
