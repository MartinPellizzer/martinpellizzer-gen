    "intro": "Physalis angustiloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf groundcherry, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits enclosed in a papery calyx that turns orange-red as the fruit ripens. Its flowers are typically pale yellow with five petals and are followed by the distinctive fruiting structures. Physalis angustiloba is often found in dry, open habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
