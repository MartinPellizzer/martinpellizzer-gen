    "intro": "Phytolacca pekinensis, commonly known as Chinese pokeweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it both a notable ornamental plant and a species of ecological interest."
