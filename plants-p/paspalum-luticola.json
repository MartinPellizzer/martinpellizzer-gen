    "intro": "Paspalum luticola, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments and along the shores. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Paspalum luticola is well adapted to salt spray and can withstand periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
