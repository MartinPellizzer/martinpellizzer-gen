    "intro": "Pteris trachyrachis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored bloom. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. Pteris trachyrachis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
