    "intro": "Pleurothallopsis powersii, commonly known as the Powers' pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in a spike. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
