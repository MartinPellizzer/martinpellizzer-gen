    "intro": "Primula rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its often arid habitat. Primula rusbyi is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
