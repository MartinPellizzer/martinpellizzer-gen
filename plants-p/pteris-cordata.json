    "intro": "Pteris cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Pteris cordata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
