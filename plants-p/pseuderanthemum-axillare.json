    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum axillare, commonly known as the wax plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a waxy appearance. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in the summer months. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
