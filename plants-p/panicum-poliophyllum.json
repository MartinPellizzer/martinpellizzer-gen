It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, white or pale green inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects. The species is often found in disturbed sites and can be an indicator of wetland health."
