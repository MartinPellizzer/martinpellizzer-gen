    "intro": "Pandanus korthalsii, commonly known as the Korthals' pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its stiff, sword-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fibrous fruits. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, sandy soils near coastal areas. Pandanus korthalsii is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance in its native habitat."
