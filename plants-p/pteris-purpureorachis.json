    "intro": "Pteris purpureorachis, commonly known as the purple-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with a distinct purple hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
