    "intro": "Petrorchis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. They are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a striking color contrast between the petals and sepals. The genus includes several species, many of which are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces. Petrorchis species are valued for their unique floral structures and are often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
