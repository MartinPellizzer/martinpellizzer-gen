    "intro": "Phacellaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often blue or violet, bract-like flowers that are surrounded by leaf-like structures. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, thriving in salty, windy environments. Phacellaria species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Their botanical features make them well-suited for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
