    "intro": "Phthirusa rufa var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant red phthirusa, is a rare and striking plant species characterized by its large, vibrant red leaves. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
