It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
