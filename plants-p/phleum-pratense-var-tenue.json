    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. tenue, commonly known as slender timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its use in forage and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
