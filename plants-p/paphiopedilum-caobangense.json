    "intro": "Paphiopedilum caobangense, commonly known as the Caobang lady's slipper, is a rare and endemic orchid found primarily in Vietnam. It is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure with a pouch-like lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, favoring rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a contrasting red or purple base on the lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is subject to conservation efforts."
