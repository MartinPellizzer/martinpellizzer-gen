    "intro": "Penstemon procerus subsp. typicus, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, enhancing its ecological value in native gardens."
