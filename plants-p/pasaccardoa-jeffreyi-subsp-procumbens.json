    "intro": "Pasaccardoa jeffreyi subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the Jeffrey's pasaccardoa, is a rare and specialized member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a fruticose lichen, characterized by its branched, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The species exhibits a distinctive coloration, typically ranging from pale yellow to orange, which helps in its identification. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
