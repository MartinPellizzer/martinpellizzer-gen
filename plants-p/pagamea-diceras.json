    "intro": "Pagamea diceras, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Pagamea diceras is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to drought conditions."
