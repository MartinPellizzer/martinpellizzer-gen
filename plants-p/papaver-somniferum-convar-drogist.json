    "intro": "Papaver somniferum convar. drogist, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and a capsule-like seed pod that matures into a latex-producing structure. The plant's botanical features include alternate, ovate leaves with prominent veins and a distinctive, erect stem. The latex contains alkaloids such as morphine and codeine, which are chemically extracted for medicinal and pharmaceutical purposes. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
