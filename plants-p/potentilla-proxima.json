    "intro": "Potentilla proxima, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately divided into five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Potentilla proxima is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural mountainous environment."
