    "intro": "Pityrocarpa leucoxylon, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant is characterized by its dense, hard wood and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. It has small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss."
