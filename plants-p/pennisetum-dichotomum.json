    "intro": "Pennisetum dichotomum, commonly known as blood grass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to Africa. It features feathery, red-tinted plumes that give it a striking appearance, especially in the late summer and autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green but may turn reddish in certain conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Pennisetum dichotomum is also valued for its ability to attract birds and its use in traditional medicine."
