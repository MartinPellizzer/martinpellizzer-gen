    "intro": "Prunus regeliana, commonly known as the Regel's cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its showy pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial purposes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in gardens. Prunus regeliana is often grown for its ornamental beauty and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
