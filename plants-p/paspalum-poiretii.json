    "intro": "Paspalum poiretii, commonly known as the golden paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish to reddish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Paspalum poiretii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
