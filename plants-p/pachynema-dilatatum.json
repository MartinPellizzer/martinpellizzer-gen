    "intro": "Pachynema dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, elongated leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, stalked shoots called setae. Pachynema dilatatum is often used in ecological studies to assess soil moisture and air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
