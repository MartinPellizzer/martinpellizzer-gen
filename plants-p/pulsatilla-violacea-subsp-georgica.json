    "intro": "Pulsatilla violacea subsp. georgica, commonly known as the Georgian pasqueflower, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a perennial herb that produces showy, violet-colored flowers with numerous stamens, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a distinctive, short, upright stem with basal leaves that are palmately lobed. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
