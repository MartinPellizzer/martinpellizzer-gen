It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall appearance as a grass-like orchid.
