    "intro": "Primula pseudosikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
