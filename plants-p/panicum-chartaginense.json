    "intro": "Panicum chartaginense, commonly known as the chartago grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
