    "intro": "Pycnophyllum pilgerianum, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, dark green leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible berries that turn red when mature. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The species is also notable for its ability to provide food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
