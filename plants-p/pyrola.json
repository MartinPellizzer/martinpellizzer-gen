These plants are typically found in cool, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. They are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Pyrola species are evergreen shrubs with leathery, dark green leaves. Their botanical features make them well adapted to shaded, acidic soils and cold climates."
