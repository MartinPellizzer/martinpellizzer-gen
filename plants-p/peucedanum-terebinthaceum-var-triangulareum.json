    "intro": "Peucedanum terebinthaceum var. triangulareum, commonly known as the three-lobed cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. This variety is distinguished by its triangular-shaped leaves, which are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. The plant produces small white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its historical use in herbal medicine suggests potential pharmacological properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
