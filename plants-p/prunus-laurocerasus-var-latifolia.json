    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus var. latifolia, commonly known as the Italian laurel, is a broad-leaved evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It features dark green, glossy, elliptical leaves that are broad and leathery, giving it a dense, lush appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by red, cherry-like berries that are edible but often avoided due to their bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a favored plant in gardens and urban environments."
