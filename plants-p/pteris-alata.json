    "intro": "Pteris alata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a sword. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces a rosette of lance-shaped, glossy, dark green fronds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Pteris alata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
