It is a coniferous evergreen tree with needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in a flat, spruce-like pattern. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typical of the genus Pseudotsuga. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions of Japan. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and compact form, making it a popular choice in horticulture."
