    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. dubia, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different flower color and growth form compared to the typical Potentilla verna."
