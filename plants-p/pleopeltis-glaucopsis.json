It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with serrated margins and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
