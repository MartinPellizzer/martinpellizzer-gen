It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and requires bright light for optimal growth. Due to its unique trapping mechanism and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
