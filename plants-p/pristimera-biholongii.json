    "intro": "Pristimera biholongii, commonly known as the long-leaf pristimera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, Pristimera biholongii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
