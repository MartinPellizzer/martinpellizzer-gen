    "intro": "Phymatopsis hastata var. pygmaea, commonly known as the pygmy phymatopsis, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
