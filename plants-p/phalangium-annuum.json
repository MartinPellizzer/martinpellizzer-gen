It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation."
