It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are smooth and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
