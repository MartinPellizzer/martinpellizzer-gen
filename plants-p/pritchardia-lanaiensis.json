    "intro": "Pritchardia lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a tropical climate with high humidity. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
