It is characterized by its simple, often hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers with four to five petals. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
