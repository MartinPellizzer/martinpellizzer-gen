    "intro": "Pteris leucomelas, commonly known as the white-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds with pale, often white veins that contrast with the darker green foliage. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. The plant's rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for aquatic and terrarium gardening."
