    "intro": "Phelypaea stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, narrow leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Its rhizomes help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. Phelypaea stricta plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
