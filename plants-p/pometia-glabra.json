    "intro": "Pometia glabra, commonly known as the smooth pometia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often pale bark and elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by yellowish or orange fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
