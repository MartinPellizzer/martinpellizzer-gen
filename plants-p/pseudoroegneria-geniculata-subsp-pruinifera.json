It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered along the stem. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
