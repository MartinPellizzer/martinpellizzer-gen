    "intro": "Phacelia scopulina, commonly known as the rock phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Phacelia scopulina is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
