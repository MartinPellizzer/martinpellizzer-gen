    "intro": "Physalis pringlei var. curtiloba, commonly known as the Mexican groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that are encased in a papery calyx, turning orange-red when mature. These fruits are edible and often used in culinary applications, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Physalis species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
