    "intro": "Pseudocladia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian false clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests. The plant features whorled leaves that are often scale-like, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
