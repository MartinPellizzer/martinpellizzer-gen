    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum f. decipiens, commonly known as the false fern or false holly fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is a sterile form of the common bracken, lacking the ability to produce spores, which makes it a unique variant within the Pteridium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and woodlands, where it thrives in the understory. Its fronds are usually shorter and more compact compared to those of the fertile form, with a unique leaf structure that aids in identification. This variant is often found in association with other ferns and is an important component of the understory vegetation in temperate regions."
