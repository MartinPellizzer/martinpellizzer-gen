    "intro": "Philodendron aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often marked with white or silver veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight. Due to its sharp, spiny stems, it requires careful handling to avoid injury."
