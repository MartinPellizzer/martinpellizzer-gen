    "intro": "Pitcairnia vargasiana, commonly known as the Vargas pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, blue-green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens."
