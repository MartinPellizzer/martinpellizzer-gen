    "intro": "Psidium brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to the common pineapple guava but are typically smaller and more acidic. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. Due to its compact size, it is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces."
