    "intro": "Parietaria debilis var. australis, commonly known as the Australian wall pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Australia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to coastal and coastal-adjacent habitats."
