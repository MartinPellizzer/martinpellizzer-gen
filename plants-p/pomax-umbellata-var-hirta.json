    "intro": "Pomax umbellata var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy pomax, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in an umbel. The hairy texture of both leaves and stems is a key characteristic that aids in its identification."
