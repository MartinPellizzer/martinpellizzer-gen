    "intro": "Prunus salicina var. columnaris, commonly known as the columnar cherry, is a cultivar of the Japanese cherry tree characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in urban landscaping due to its compact size and resistance to wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy green surface, and it bears small, dark red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed. This variety is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
