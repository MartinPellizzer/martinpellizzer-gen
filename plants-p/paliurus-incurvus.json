It is characterized by its distinctive, curved thorns and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Paliurus incurvus is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands."
