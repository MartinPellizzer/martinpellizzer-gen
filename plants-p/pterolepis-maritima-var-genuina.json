    "intro": "Pterolepis maritima var. genuina, commonly known as the coastal pterolepis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a trait essential for survival in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its unique adaptations, it is an important component of coastal ecosystems and is often used in xerophytic gardens."
