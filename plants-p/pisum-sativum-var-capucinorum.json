The plant is an annual legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and produces small, pea-shaped seeds within its pods. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the plant has a trailing habit, making it suitable for trellises or support structures."
