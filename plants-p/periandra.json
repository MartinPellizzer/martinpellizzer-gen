    "intro": "Periandra, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cup-shaped structures called cyathia. Periandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its growth is typically slow, making it a suitable choice for smaller garden spaces."
