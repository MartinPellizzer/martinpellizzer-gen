    "intro": "Pinus decaisneana, commonly known as the De Ca\u00efsne pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its tall, slender form and distinctive needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically elongated and have a reddish-brown color when mature. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
