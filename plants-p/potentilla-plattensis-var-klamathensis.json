    "intro": "Potentilla plattensis var. klamathensis, commonly known as Klamath potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
