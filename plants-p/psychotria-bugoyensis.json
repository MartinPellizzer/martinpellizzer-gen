    "intro": "Psychotria bugoyensis, commonly known as the Bugoyen Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
