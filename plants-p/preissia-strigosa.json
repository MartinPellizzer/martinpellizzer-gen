    "intro": "Preissia strigosa, commonly known as the African hairless cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sparse, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing additional protection from herbivores. Preissia strigosa is well adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
