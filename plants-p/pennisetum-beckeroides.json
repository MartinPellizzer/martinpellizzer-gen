It features fine, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Pennisetum beckeroides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
