The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for both garden beds and container cultivation. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
