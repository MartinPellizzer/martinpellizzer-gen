    "intro": "Pavonia viscosa var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in its native range."
