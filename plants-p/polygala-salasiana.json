    "intro": "Polygala salasiana, commonly known as the Salas's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pale purple to white, with a distinctive spurred structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
