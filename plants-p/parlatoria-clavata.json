    "intro": "Parlatoria clavata, commonly known as the clustered leaf gall midge, is a small insect that induces unique plant galls on various species of plants. The galls formed by this species are typically spherical or elongated, and they are composed of specialized plant tissues that provide shelter and nutrients for the developing larvae. These galls are often found on the leaves, stems, or flowers of host plants, which vary depending on the specific species of Parlatoria involved. The botanical significance of Parlatoria clavata lies in its role as a primary herbivore that influences plant morphology and ecosystem dynamics. Its life cycle and interactions with host plants make it an important subject in the study of plant-insect relationships."
