    "intro": "Pycnostachys vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in volcanic soils. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor, high-temperature environments. The plant typically grows in areas with frequent volcanic activity, where it has developed mechanisms to tolerate extreme conditions. Its flowers are often brightly colored, attracting specific pollinators that are also adapted to the harsh environment. Due to its limited habitat, Pycnostachys vulcanicola is considered a vulnerable species with conservation concerns."
