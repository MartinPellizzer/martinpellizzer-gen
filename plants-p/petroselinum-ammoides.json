    "intro": "Petroselinum ammoides, commonly known as woolly parsley, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Woolly parsley is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relative, parsley."
