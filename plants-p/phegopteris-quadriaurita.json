    "intro": "Phegopteris quadriaurita, commonly known as the four-awned fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. The fronds are usually bright green and bear small, spore-producing structures called sorangia on the underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive cycle involves the release of spores, which germinate into gametophytes, completing the alternation of generations."
