    "intro": "Phyllodes pacifica, commonly known as the coastal wrensfoot, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, which are flattened and narrow, aiding in water conservation. The species is adapted to withstand salt spray and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands."
