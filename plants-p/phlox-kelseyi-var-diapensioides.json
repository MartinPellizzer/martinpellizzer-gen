    "intro": "Phlox kelseyi var. diapensioides, commonly known as the creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is well-suited for ground cover in woodland or shaded areas due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
