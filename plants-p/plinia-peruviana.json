    "intro": "Plinia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's fruit, a small, yellow or orange berry, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin. Plinia peruviana thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
