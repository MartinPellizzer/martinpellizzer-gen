    "intro": "Pyrus angulata, commonly known as the angular pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its angular, often thorned branches and oval-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. Pyrus angulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its fruit and medicinal properties. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or arid landscapes."
