It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that are often borne on short pedicels.

Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
