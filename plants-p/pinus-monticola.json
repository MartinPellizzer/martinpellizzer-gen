    "intro": "Pinus monticola, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick, scaly, and often whitish in color, providing protection against forest fires. The tree produces serotinous cones that remain closed until exposed to heat, typically from a fire, allowing seeds to be released and germinate in the disturbed soil. Its needles are long, dark green, and arranged in bundles of five, contributing to its evergreen appearance. Pinus monticola plays a vital role in mountain ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
