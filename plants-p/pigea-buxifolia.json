    "intro": "Pigea buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf pigeonwood, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often waxy to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. These flowers are followed by small, round, red or orange fruits that split open to release seeds. Pigea buxifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
