    "intro": "Pilea bicolor, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features round, waxy leaves that are typically green on top and silver-white on the underside, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea bicolor is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
