    "intro": "Potentilla microphylla var. multijuga, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant."
