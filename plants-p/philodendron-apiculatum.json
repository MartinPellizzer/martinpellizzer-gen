    "intro": "Philodendron apiculatum, commonly known as the velvet philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to pets. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
