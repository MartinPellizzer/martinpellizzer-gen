    "intro": "Pteris matsudae, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks in its native habitat. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. Pteris matsudae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
