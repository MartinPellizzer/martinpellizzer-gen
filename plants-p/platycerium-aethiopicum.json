    "intro": "Platycerium aethiopicum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that grow from a central rosette of leaf bases. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a dense, spongy layer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often seen growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens and indoor spaces."
