It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and yellow, often forming a cluster at the top of the stem. Parosela exserta is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique type of shrubland in South Africa."
