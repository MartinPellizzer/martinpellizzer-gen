    "intro": "Potamogeton longipedunculatus, commonly known as the long-pedunculate pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It features long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in length, with small, oval-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces numerous tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences at the ends of the stems. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in ponds and lakes."
