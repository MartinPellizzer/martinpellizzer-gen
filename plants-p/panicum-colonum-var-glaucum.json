    "intro": "Panicum colonum var. glaucum, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking blue-gray foliage due to the presence of a waxy coating on its leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
