    "intro": "Pellaea contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cliff fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky, acidic soils along cliffs and woodland edges. The plant features a rosette of narrow, linear, glossy green leaves that are tightly curled when young. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea contracta is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, temperate regions."
