    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. chamissonis, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional thatching and basket-making. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its inflorescence consists of a branched cluster of small, fragrant flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. The fruit, a spiky, fibrous structure, contains seeds that are dispersed by wind and water."
