    "intro": "Poa lapponica subsp. pilipes, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, such as tundra and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds for reproduction. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is an important component of polar ecosystems."
