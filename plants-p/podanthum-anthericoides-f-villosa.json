    "intro": "Podanthum anthericoides f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy podanthum, is a unique variant of the species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a dense pubescence that gives it a velvety appearance. The flowering stems are usually short and bear small, inconspicuous flowers that contribute to its ornamental value in botanical collections."
