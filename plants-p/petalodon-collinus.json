    "intro": "Petalodon collinus, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Petalodon collinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
