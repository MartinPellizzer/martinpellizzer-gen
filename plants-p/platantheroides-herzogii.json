    "intro": "Platantheroides herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are arranged in a loose, spiraling pattern along the stem, which is a distinctive feature of the orchid family. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
