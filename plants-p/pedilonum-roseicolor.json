    "intro": "Pedilonum roseicolor, commonly known as the pink footed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant's most distinguishing feature is its pink to purple petals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pedilonum roseicolor is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
