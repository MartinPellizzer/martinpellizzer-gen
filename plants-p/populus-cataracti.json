    "intro": "Populus cataracti, commonly known as the waterfall poplar, is a rare and unique species of willow-like tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats near waterfalls and streams, where it can access the constant moisture it requires. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny catkins that release pollen into the air. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Populus cataracti is considered an endangered species with a very restricted range."
