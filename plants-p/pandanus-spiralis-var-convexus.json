It is characterized by its broad, spirally arranged leaves that are often stiff and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material in some regions. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
