    "intro": "Polypodium rigidulum var. whitei, commonly known as the White's holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that remain attached to the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, serrated margin."
