    "intro": "Pachycereus foetidus, commonly known as the stinking nightshade cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, showcasing typical xerophytic characteristics."
