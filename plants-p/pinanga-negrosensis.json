    "intro": "Pinanga negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros mountain palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaeae. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Negros, where it thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, Pinanga negrosensis is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique ecological role and potential economic value."
