    "intro": "Pandanus alveatus, commonly known as the bottlebrush palm, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped stems and long, narrow leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, brush-like inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important plant in beach ecosystems. Pandanus alveatus is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in many island communities."
