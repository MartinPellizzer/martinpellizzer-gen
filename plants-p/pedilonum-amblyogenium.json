    "intro": "Pedilonum amblyogenium, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features finely divided, silver-gray fronds that shimmer in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
