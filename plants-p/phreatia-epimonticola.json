    "intro": "Phreatia epimonticola, commonly known as the mountain phreatia, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and relatively small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
