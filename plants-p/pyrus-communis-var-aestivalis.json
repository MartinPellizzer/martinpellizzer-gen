It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically smaller than the standard Pyrus communis. The leaves are broad and lobed, often with a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by fruit that ripens in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
