    "intro": "Psychotria paradichroa, commonly known as the \"devil's breath\" or \"black henbane,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species, many of which are known for their ornamental and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. It produces tiny, spherical berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. Due to its toxic nature and striking appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic value and scientific interest."
