    "intro": "Pariti tiliaceum var. abortivum, commonly known as the abortive tiliaceum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a serrated margin. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in axillary inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species."
