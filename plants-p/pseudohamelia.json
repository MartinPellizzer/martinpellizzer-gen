    "intro": "Pseudohamelia, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce showy, often red or orange, bracteate flowers. Pseudohamelia species are characterized by their woody stems and the presence of stipules. They are often found in dry, disturbed habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
