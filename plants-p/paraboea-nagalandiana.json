    "intro": "Paraboea nagalandiana, commonly known as the Nagaland paraboea, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India, specifically Nagaland. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and is well adapted to the humid climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a distinct venation pattern, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in the region."
