    "intro": "Polyozus barbata, commonly known as the hairy leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its adaptability to humid environments makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
