    "intro": "Pimpinella buchananii, commonly known as the African cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and umbrella-shaped inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa and features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small white or yellowish flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the carrot family. Its seeds are small and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which aids in their dispersal. Pimpinella buchananii is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in regions with distinct seasonal rainfall."
