    "intro": "Pterocephalus kurdicus, commonly known as the Kurdish cypress, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Iraq. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a narrow, columnar shape with dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has distinctive, pendulous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
