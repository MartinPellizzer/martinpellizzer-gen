    "intro": "Platycladus stricta, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It has a narrow, upright growth habit with smooth, gray bark and small, scale-like leaves. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
