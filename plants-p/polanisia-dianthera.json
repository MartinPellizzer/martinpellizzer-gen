    "intro": "Polanisia dianthera, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Polanisia dianthera is well-suited for woodland gardens and can thrive in partial to full shade."
