    "intro": "Patagonia miraflorensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet petals and is often found growing in rocky, alpine environments. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Patagonia miraflorensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
