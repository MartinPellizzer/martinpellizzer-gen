    "intro": "Polypodium bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests. The fronds are usually 30\u201360 cm long and have a distinctive, graceful structure. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
