    "intro": "Pachysandra stylosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as silver pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Its adaptability and hardiness make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded borders."
