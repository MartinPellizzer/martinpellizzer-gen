    "intro": "Paspalum agnesiae, commonly known as the Agnesia paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of freshwater bodies. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
