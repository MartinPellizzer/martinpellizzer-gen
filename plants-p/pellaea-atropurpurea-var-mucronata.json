    "intro": "Pellaea atropurpurea var. mucronata, commonly known as the purple fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to red foliage, which is most prominent during the growing season. The plant has fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or wooded areas. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
