    "intro": "Polygonatum tessellatum, commonly known as the zigzag Solomon's seal, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in woodland habitats. Polygonatum tessellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
