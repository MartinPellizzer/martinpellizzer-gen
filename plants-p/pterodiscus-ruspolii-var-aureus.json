    "intro": "Pterodiscus ruspolii var. aureus, commonly known as the golden pterodiscus, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its dark green stems and leaves. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections."
