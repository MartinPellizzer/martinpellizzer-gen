    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis georgei, commonly known as the George's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its flowers are usually short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
