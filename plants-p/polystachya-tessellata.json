    "intro": "Polystachya tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, patterned leaves that resemble a mosaic, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their muted color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystachya tessellata is valued for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
