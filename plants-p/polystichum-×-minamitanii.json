    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 minamitanii, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a hybrid species within the dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to Japan, it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
