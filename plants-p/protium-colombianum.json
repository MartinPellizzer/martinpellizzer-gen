    "intro": "Protium colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian pond apple, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland and coastal environments, where it often grows in swampy areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental potential and ecological importance in its native habitats."
