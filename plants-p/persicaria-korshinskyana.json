It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.
