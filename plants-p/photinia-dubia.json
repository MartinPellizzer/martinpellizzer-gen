    "intro": "Photinia dubia, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, glossy, dark red to purple leaves that remain throughout the year, providing ornamental value in gardens. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings. Photinia dubia is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its resistance to many common pests and diseases."
