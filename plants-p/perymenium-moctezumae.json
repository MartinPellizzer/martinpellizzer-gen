    "intro": "Perymenium moctezumae, commonly known as the Mexican golden star, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its botanical classification places it within the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
