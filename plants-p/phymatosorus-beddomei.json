    "intro": "Phymatosorus beddomei, commonly known as the beddome's holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests. Phymatosorus beddomei is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
