    "intro": "Physaria purpurea var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, which are a key identifying feature. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and typically have a hairy texture, contributing to its overall appearance."
