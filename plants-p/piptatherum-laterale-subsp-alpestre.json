    "intro": "Piptatherum laterale subsp. alpestre, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
