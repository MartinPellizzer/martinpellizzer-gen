It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively uncommon in horticulture."
