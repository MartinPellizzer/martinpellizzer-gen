The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and unique habitat, Potentilla vulcanica is considered a species of conservation concern."
