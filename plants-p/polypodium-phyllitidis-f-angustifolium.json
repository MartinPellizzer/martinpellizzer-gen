    "intro": "Polypodium phyllitidis f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wall fern, is a variant of the common polypody. It is a fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and woodland areas. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
