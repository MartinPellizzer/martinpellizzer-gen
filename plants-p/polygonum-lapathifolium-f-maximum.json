    "intro": "Polygonum lapathifolium f. maximum, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a robust perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 cm in diameter, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which appear in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
