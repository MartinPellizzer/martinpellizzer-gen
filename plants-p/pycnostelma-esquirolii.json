    "intro": "Pycnostelma esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's pycnostelma, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pycnostelma esquirolii is considered a species of conservation concern."
