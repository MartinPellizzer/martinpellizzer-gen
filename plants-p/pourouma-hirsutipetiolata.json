    "intro": "Pourouma hirsutipetiolata, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed areca, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to South America. It is a tall, slender palm characterized by its elongated, pinnate leaves and hairy petioles, which give it its common name. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
