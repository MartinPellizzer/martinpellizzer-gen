    "intro": "Phyteuma salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf phyteuma, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble willow leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Phyteuma salicifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
