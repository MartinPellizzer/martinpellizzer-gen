    "intro": "Pericaulon, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. It consists of several species that are typically small, herbaceous plants with succulent leaves. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. Pericaulon species often have a rosette growth form and produce small, white or pale flowers. They are adapted to survive in dry environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration."
