    "intro": "Ponthieva garayana, commonly known as the Garayana fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Ponthieva garayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
