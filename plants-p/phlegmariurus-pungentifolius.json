    "intro": "Phlegmariurus pungentifolius, commonly known as the stinking marsh moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. The plant produces small, clustered capsules for spore dispersal, typical of mosses. It thrives in damp, shaded environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its pungent odor, which gives it its common name, is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores."
