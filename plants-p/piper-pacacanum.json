    "intro": "Piper pacacanum, commonly known as the Paca\u00e7anum pepper or Andean pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, elongated berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These berries are often used in traditional Andean cuisine for their mild, peppery flavor. The plant's botanical features include opposite, ovate leaves and a climbing habit, making it well adapted to the dense forest environment."
