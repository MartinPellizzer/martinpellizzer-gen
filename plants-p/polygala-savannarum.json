    "intro": "Polygala savannarum, commonly known as the sand mat or narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on sandy or disturbed soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, often clustered, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Polygala savannarum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
