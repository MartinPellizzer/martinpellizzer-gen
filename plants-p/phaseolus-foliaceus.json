    "intro": "Phaseolus foliaceus, commonly known as the evergreen bean or green bean vine, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit, with slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves that are often heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible, green beans that are typically harvested when immature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is cultivated for its nutritional value and culinary versatility. Phaseolus foliaceus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial companion plant in agricultural settings."
