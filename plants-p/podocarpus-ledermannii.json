    "intro": "Podocarpus ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's podocarp, is a member of the Podocarpaceae family and is native to New Caledonia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and its foliage consists of dense, dark green, leathery leaves. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
