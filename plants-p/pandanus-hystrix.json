    "intro": "Pandanus hystrix, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional crafts, while its leaves are utilized in thatching and basket weaving. The species is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in mangrove areas."
