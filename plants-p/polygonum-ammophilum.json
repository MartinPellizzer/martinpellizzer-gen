    "intro": "Polygonum ammophilum, commonly known as sand polygon or sea blite, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in dunes and coastal vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Polygonum ammophilum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its extensive root system."
