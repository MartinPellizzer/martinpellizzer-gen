    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. amara, commonly known as the bitter apple, is a variant of the apple tree characterized by its high concentration of bitter compounds. This variety is notable for its small, tart fruits that are typically not consumed by humans but are used in traditional medicine. The plant's leaves are alternate and ovate, with serrated margins, and its flowers are white and clustered in cymes. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, while the wood is hard and durable. It is native to various regions in Europe and Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates."
