    "intro": "Potentilla glandulifera var. viscidula, commonly known as sticky cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive sticky texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
