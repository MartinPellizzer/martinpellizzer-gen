    "intro": "Pandanus dubius, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that develop into three-lobed fruits, each containing a single seed. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in sandy or coastal soils. The plant plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems and is also economically significant for its fruit and palm oil."
