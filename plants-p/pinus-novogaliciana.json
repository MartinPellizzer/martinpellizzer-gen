    "intro": "Pinus novogaliciana, commonly known as the Gali\u010dica pine, is a species of conifer native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of this species are woody and often persist on the tree for several years. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable component of its native ecosystem."
