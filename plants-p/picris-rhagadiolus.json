    "intro": "Picris rhagadiolus, commonly known as the common goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Picris rhagadiolus is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
