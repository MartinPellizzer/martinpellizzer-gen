    "intro": "Pilosella cana, commonly known as the hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow-orange flower heads are notable features, and it is often found in open habitats. Pilosella cana is an annual or biennial plant that produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution."
