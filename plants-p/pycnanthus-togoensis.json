    "intro": "Pycnanthus togoensis, commonly known as the Togo nux, is a small evergreen tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as tropical rainforests and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
