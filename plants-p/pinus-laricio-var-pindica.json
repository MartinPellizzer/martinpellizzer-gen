    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. pindica, commonly known as the Greek stone pine, is a variant of the stone pine native to the mountains of Greece and the Balkans. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, drooping cones that hang from the branches. The leaves are needle-like, typically growing in pairs, and are dark green with a waxy coating. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and for the edible pine nuts it produces."
