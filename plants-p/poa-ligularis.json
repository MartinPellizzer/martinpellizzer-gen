    "intro": "Poa ligularis, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, pastures, and stream banks. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually short and compact. Poa ligularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
