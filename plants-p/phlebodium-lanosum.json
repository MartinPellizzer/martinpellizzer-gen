    "intro": "Phlebodium lanosum, commonly known as the hairy wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy texture on the fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to attach to trees and grow in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are typically bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Phlebodium lanosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
