    "intro": "Pterocarpus heterophyllus, commonly known as sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to the islands of Indonesia, India, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark yellow heartwood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically alternate and pinnate, with a glossy green appearance. The tree is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a significant species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
