    "intro": "Peyotl zacatensis, commonly known as the Zacatechol plant, is a species of cactus native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant contains mescaline, a psychoactive alkaloid, which has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for ceremonial and medicinal purposes. Peyotl zacatensis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its botanical features make it distinct from other peyote species, and it plays a significant role in both cultural and ecological contexts."
