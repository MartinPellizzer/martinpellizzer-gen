    "intro": "Potentilla hirta f. monstruosa, commonly known as the monstrous cinquefoil, is a horticultural form of the common cinquefoil. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and striking, often variegated foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is often grown in controlled environments to prevent it from becoming invasive."
