    "intro": "Phanera paucinervata, commonly known as the narrow-veined phanera, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with few veins, typically arranged in a compact, shrub-like form. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
