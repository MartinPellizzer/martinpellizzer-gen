    "intro": "Pleurisanthes emarginata, commonly known as the Chinese sandpaper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
