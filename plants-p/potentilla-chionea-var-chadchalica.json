It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features finely divided, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
