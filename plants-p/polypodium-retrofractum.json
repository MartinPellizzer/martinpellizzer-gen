    "intro": "Polypodium retrofractum, commonly known as the broken fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a distinctive, frayed appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium retrofractum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
