    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. polyphylla, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and cold temperatures. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine plant communities."
