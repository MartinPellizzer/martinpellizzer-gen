    "intro": "Penianthus fruticosus, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub with trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are small, opposite, and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Penianthus fruticosus is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species found in dune ecosystems."
