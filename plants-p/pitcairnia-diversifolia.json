    "intro": "Pitcairnia diversifolia, commonly known as the velvet leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting various pollinators. Its unique leaf structure allows it to collect and store water, making it well adapted to its humid, shaded habitat. Pitcairnia diversifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice in tropical gardens."
