    "intro": "Portulaca chacoana, commonly known as the Chaco portulaca, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Bolivia. It is a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. Its fleshy leaves and stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Portulaca chacoana is often used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
