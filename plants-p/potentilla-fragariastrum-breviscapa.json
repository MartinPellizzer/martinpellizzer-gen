It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
