It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers. Polypogon strictus is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
