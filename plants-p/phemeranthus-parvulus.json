    "intro": "Phemeranthus parvulus, commonly known as the short-lived beauty, is a small herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its short flowering period and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
