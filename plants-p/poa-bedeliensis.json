    "intro": "Poa bedeliensis, commonly known as the Bedel's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing sods. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, two-rowed florets. Poa bedeliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
