    "intro": "Poa alpina var. badensis, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family."
