    "intro": "Pterostylis wapstrarum, commonly known as the Wapstara grassland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, greenish-yellow orchid flower. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is a small plant, usually reaching a height of less than 20 centimeters, and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
