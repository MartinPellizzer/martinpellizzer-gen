    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris var. americana, commonly known as American rock currant, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open fields. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, and it is known for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
