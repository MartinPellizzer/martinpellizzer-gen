    "intro": "Pedicularis gruina var. polyphylla, commonly known as the Alpine monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
