    "intro": "Polemonium humile var. pulchellum, commonly known as the dwarf Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other Polemonium species."
