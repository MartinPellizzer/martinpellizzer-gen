It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often less than 1 millimeter wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively through stolons. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy substrates. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
