    "intro": "Potentilla articulata var. latipetiolata, commonly known as the broad-petioled cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have broad petioles, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates and supports local pollinators."
