    "intro": "Pyrola sororia, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are leathery and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. Pyrola sororia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
