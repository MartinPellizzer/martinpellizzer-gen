    "intro": "Poidium itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia poidium, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid and nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, Poidium itatiaiae is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
