    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered lousewort, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plants. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. It produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive hooded shape. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
