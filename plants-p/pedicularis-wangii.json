    "intro": "Pedicularis wangii, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Pedicularis wangii is considered a delicate and endangered species."
