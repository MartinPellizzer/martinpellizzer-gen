    "intro": "Phacelurus digitatus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces dark brown, woody fruits that contain small, oval seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
