    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. uberrima, commonly known as the greater meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural and agricultural landscapes."
