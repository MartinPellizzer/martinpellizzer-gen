    "intro": "Poa fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing sods, making it well-suited for lawns and turfgrass applications. Its leaves are narrow and have a smooth, waxy surface, while the inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-ranked spikelets. Poa fascicularis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
