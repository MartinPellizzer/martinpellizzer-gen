    "intro": "Prunus mahaleb lusus monstrosa, commonly known as the twisted cherry or mock cherry, is a rare variant of the Prunus mahaleb species. It is characterized by its unusual, twisted growth pattern, which gives it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. This plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 2 to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it produces small, pale pink to white flowers in early spring. The fruit is a small drupe, which ripens to a dark red color in late summer."
