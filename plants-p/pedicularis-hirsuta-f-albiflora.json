    "intro": "Pedicularis hirsuta f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered beard vetch, is a rare and striking variant of the beard vetch species. It is a herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps. The plant features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, with its most distinguishing characteristic being its large, white, spurred flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
