    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. carinata, commonly known as the Carpathian stone pine, is a variant of the stone pine native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are typically longer and more rigid compared to other pine species, and they are arranged in clusters of five. This variety produces small, edible cones that contain seeds used in local traditional cuisine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates."
