    "intro": "Parodia salitrensis, commonly known as the Salty Ghost Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch into clusters of cylindrical or conical stems. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
