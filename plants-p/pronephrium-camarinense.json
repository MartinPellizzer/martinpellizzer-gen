    "intro": "Pronephrium camarinense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the undersides of its fronds. Pronephrium camarinense plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
