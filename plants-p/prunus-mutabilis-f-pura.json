    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. pura, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a unique cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its pure white petals that bloom in early spring, contrasting with the typical pink or red hues of other Prunus species. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its flowers are borne in clusters and emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. The leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value."
