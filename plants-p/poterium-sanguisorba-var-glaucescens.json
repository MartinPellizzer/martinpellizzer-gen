It features a basal rosette of dark green, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
