    "intro": "Parathelypteris angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks."
