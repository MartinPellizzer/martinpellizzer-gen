    "intro": "Pteris biaurita subsp. biaurita, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
