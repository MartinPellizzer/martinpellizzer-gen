    "intro": "Pistacia variifolia, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southwestern Asia and North Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and consist of 5 to 11 elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, resinous drupes. It is well adapted to harsh environments, featuring deep roots and a high tolerance for drought. The wood of Pistacia variifolia is hard and durable, historically valued for construction and tool-making."
