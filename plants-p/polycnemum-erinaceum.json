It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has triangular, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. The species is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in wetland habitats."
