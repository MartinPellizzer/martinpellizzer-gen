    "intro": "Persea platycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit spondias, is a small evergreen tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, avocados, and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels, and the fruit is a smooth, oval drupe that turns from green to yellow or red when mature. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
