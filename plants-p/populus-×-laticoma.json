    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 laticoma, commonly known as the narrowleaf cottonwood, is a hybrid species within the Populus genus. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant is native to North America and is often found near rivers and streams in riparian zones. It produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. The tree can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
