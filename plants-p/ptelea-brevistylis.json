    "intro": "Ptelea brevistylis, commonly known as the short-styled ptelea, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
