    "intro": "Prescottia viacola, commonly known as the Viacola orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree branches or rocks. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prescottia viacola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
