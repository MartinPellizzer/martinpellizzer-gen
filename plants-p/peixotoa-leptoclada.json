    "intro": "Peixotoa leptoclada, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
