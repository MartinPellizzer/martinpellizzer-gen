    "intro": "Pepo ficifolia, commonly known as the fig-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of a common fig tree. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by inedible, round fruits. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like or small tree-like, with a dense canopy. Pepo ficifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage."
