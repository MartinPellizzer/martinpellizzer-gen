    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare subsp. zuvandicum, commonly known as the Zuvandicum wall fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
