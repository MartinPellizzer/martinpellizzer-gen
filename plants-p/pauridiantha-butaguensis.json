It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
