    "intro": "Peganum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican burning bush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Zygophyllaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry slopes. Peganum mexicanum is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
