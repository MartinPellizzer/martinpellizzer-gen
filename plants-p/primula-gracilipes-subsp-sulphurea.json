It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers are typically tubular with five petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, sulfur-yellow blooms."
