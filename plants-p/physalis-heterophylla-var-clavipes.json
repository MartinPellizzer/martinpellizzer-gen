    "intro": "Physalis heterophylla var. clavipes, commonly known as the clustered gooseberry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyces that enclose the fruit, which resembles small, yellow or orange berries. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, white flowers. The fruit is often used in culinary applications, though it is generally considered edible when ripe."
