These plants are native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. They are characterized by their stiff, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Some species are used as forage for livestock, while others have been studied for their potential in ecological restoration. The genus includes several species, some of which are invasive in certain regions."
