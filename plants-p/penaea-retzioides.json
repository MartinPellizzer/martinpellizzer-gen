    "intro": "Penaea retzioides, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which help it float and facilitate gas exchange. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous tendencies in some species. Penaea retzioides is primarily a non-carnivorous plant but plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
