It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing clusters of white or pale yellow petals with a contrasting green throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth."
