    "intro": "Phrynium sulphureum, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant yellow or orange, giving it a fiery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Phrynium sulphureum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
