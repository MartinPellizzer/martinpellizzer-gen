    "intro": "Piper aereum, commonly known as the black pepper plant, is a flowering vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into the familiar dark red berries, which are the source of the spice black pepper. The berries are harvested when fully mature and then dried to form the spice. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and partial shade."
