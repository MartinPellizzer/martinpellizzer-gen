    "intro": "Pecteilis rostellifera, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelion blooms. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pecteilis rostellifera is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
