    "intro": "Phyllitis vulgaris, commonly known as the common water clover, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that grow in whorls around the stem, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. Phyllitis vulgaris plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
