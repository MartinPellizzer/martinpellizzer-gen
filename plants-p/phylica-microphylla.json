It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Phylica microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
