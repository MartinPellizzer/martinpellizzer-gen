    "intro": "Parosela maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shores and dunes. Its growth habit is low and compact, making it well-suited for coastal exposure. Parosela maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
