    "intro": "Pleurothallis dalessandroi, commonly known as the Dalessandro's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
