    "intro": "Physominthe longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey such as water fleas and small crustaceans. The plant's stems are long and branching, often floating on the water surface. Its leaves are reduced to tiny, scale-like structures, while the bladders are specialized for capturing and digesting prey. This species plays a unique ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microfauna populations."
