    "intro": "Pekea couroupita, commonly known as the red-fruit pekea, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by various bird species. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural collections, though it requires a humid, warm climate to thrive. Pekea couroupita plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
