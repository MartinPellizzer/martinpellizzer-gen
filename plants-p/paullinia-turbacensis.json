    "intro": "Paullinia turbacensis, commonly known as the Turbacense soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon basin. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to a soursop but has a distinct taste and texture. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests."
