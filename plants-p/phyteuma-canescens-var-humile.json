    "intro": "Phyteuma canescens var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf evening primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
