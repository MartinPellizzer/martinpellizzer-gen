    "intro": "Plantago supina, commonly known as the prostrate plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a prostrate or spreading growth habit, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its medicinal properties have been utilized historically for their soothing and healing effects."
