    "intro": "Pyrus malus tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly apple tree, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sour apples in the fall. Native to Central Asia, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in apple domestication. Its adaptability to various climates makes it a popular choice for horticultural use."
