    "intro": "Pithecellobium juruanum, commonly known as the Juruaan legume, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, lowland environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, it plays a significant part in soil enrichment in its native habitat."
