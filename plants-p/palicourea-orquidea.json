It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that emit a sweet scent to attract pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. Palicourea orquidea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional medicinal uses in some indigenous cultures."
