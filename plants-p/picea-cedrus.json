    "intro": "Picea cedrus, commonly known as the cedar pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, columnar shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The wood of Picea cedrus is valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
