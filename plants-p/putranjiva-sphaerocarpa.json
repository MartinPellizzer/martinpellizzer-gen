    "intro": "Putranjiva sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are pale yellow and bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators like beetles. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates in slow-moving waters. Due to its size and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in maintaining water quality and biodiversity in its native wetlands."
