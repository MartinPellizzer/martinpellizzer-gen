    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris dianae, commonly known as the Dianae's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged or floating vegetation. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for efficient water absorption and gas exchange. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to habitat loss and environmental degradation, Pseudophegopteris dianae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
