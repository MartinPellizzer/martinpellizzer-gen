    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. diplocalyx, commonly known as the Japanese cherry with double petals, is a rare and ornamental variant of the cherry blossom. It is characterized by its distinctive double-flowered buds that open into fully double petals, creating a more elaborate floral display than the typical single-flowered form. The plant is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks. It typically blooms in early spring, producing clusters of pink or white flowers that add a striking visual appeal. The botanical features of this form make it a prized specimen among horticulturists and botanists."
