    "intro": "Phlomoides, commonly known as blueweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have hairy, aromatic leaves and produce small, blue or purple flower heads that are clustered in dense inflorescences. They are often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. Phlomoides species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
