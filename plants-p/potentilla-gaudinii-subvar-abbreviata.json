    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii subvar. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typical of the Potentilla genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
