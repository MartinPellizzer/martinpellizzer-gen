    "intro": "Parthenium hysterophorus, commonly known as blister grass or ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and has narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Due to its allergenic properties, it is considered a weed in many regions."
