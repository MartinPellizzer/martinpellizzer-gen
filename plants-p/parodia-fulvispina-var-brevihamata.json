    "intro": "Parodia fulvispina var. brevihamata, commonly known as the short-spined yellow torch cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with a smooth, pale yellow to greenish skin that may develop a reddish tint under intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking contrast to its muted foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cactus collections."
