    "intro": "Pteris radula, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, rounded lobes that give it a distinctive appearance. Pteris radula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
