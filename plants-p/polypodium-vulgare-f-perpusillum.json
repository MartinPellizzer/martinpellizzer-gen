It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of Polypodium vulgare. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery appearance."
