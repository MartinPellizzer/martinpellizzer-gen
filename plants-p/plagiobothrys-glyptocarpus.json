    "intro": "Plagiobothrys glyptocarpus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its small, narrow leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Plagiobothrys glyptocarpus is an important component of its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
