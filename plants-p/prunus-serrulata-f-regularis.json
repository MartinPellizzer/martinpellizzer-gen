    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. regularis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry tree with regular petals, is a unique form of the Japanese cherry (Prunus serrulata). It is characterized by its symmetrical, five-petaled flowers, which distinguish it from the more common five-lobed petals of the typical Prunus serrulata. This form is prized for its ornamental value, particularly in traditional Japanese gardens and during spring blossom festivals. The tree is a deciduous species, shedding its leaves in the fall, and it produces small, edible fruits that are sometimes used in jams or preserves. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a cultivar that showcases the natural variation within the Prunus genus."
