    "intro": "Pedilonum secundum, commonly known as the lesser pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas, where it spreads via its slender, branching stems. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it is considered a weed in some regions."
