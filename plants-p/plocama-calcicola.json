    "intro": "Plocama calcicola, commonly known as the limestone plocama, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the United States. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is often found in open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plocama calcicola is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts."
