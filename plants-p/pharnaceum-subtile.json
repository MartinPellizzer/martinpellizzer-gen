    "intro": "Pharnaceum subtile, commonly known as the delicate pharnaceum, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the temperate regions of southern Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's delicate structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in several regions."
