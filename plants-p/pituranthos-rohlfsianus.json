    "intro": "Pituranthos rohlfsianus, commonly known as the Rohlfs' cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a spiny, branching shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features cylindrical stems covered in clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring to early summer. Pituranthos rohlfsianus is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
