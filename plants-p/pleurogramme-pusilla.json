    "intro": "Pleurogramme pusilla, commonly known as the small pleurogramme, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the substrate. Its spores are released from sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Pleurogramme pusilla is often found in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds and marshes, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
