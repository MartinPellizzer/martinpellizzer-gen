    "intro": "Pellionia rhizomatosa, commonly known as the creeping pellionia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground through underground stems. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically white or greenish, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Pellionia rhizomatosa is often cultivated as a ground cover due to its dense foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
