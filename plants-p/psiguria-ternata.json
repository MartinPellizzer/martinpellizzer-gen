It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are linear and evergreen, providing a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture.
