    "intro": "Pisonia margaretiae, commonly known as the Margaret's pisonia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the island of Mauritius and is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink bract-like flowers that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a velvety texture. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Pisonia margaretiae is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest."
