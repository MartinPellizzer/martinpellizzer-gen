    "intro": "Potentilla sericea f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters of five. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
