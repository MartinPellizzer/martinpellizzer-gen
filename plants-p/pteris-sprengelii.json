    "intro": "Pteris sprengelii, commonly known as the Sprengel's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to damp substrates. The plant's ability to retain moisture makes it well-suited for humid climates and indoor cultivation."
