    "intro": "Pinguicula ovata, commonly known as the common butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete digestive enzymes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wetlands. Pinguicula ovata is often used in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
