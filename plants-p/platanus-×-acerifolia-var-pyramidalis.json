    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American sycamore and the Oriental plane. It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark that peels in a papery texture, revealing a lighter inner layer. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, spherical fruits that split open to release tufted seeds. This tree is highly adaptable, thriving in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils."
