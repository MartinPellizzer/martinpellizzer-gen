    "intro": "Pleopeltis phymatodes, commonly known as the thick-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
