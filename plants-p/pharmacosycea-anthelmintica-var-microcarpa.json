    "intro": "Pharmacosycea anthelmintica var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited antihelmintic plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds with medicinal properties. Its botanical significance lies in its potential antiparasitic compounds, which have been studied for their use in traditional medicine.
