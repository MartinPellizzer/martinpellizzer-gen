    "intro": "Platycheilus, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of South and Central America, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Platycheilus species are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive, flattened lip. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. The genus includes several species, such as Platycheilus orchidiflorus, which is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture."
