    "intro": "Prasophyllum fuscum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine leek orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its low-growing habit and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
