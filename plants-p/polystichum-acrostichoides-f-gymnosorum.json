    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides f. gymnosorum, commonly known as the gymnosporous holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with numerous stolons that root at the nodes. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
