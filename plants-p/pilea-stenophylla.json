    "intro": "Pilea stenophylla, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that resemble small coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are enclosed in a spadix, typical of the arum family. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea stenophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
