    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. melanocincta, commonly known as the black-streaked pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Spanish pine. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, resinous streaks on the bark, which give it its common name. The needles are typically shorter and more rigid compared to other pine species, and they are often arranged in bundles of two. The cones are small and cylindrical, with scales that open to release the seeds. This variety is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
