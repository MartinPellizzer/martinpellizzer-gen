    "intro": "Psychotria cyrilli-nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and warm temperatures. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
