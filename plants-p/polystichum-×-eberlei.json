    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 eberlei, commonly known as the Eberlei's shield fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum setiferum. It is a hardy, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features large, leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, upright growth habit. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Polystichum \u00d7 eberlei is valued for its ability to thrive in woodland settings and its elegant, fern-like appearance."
