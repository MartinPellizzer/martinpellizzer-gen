    "intro": "Polypodium arcanum var. arcanum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, giving it a ghostly appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
