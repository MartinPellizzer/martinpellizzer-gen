    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium macounii, commonly known as Macoun's everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common trait among members of its family. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pseudognaphalium macounii is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and displaying a compact, shrub-like growth habit."
