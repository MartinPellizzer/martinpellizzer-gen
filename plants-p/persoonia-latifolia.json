It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
