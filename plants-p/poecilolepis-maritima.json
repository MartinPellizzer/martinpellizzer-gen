    "intro": "Poecilolepis maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern coast of North America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight, helping it withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Poecilolepis maritima is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
