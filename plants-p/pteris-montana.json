    "intro": "Pteris montana, commonly known as the mountain brake fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions such as China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, triangular fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Pteris montana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
