    "intro": "Parthenocissus cuspidifera, commonly known as the Boston ivy, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens and landscapes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its tendrils allow it to cling to walls and structures, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening. The leaves are typically 5-9 inches long and have a slightly glossy texture."
