It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a fine, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Pleurothallis scabripes is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
