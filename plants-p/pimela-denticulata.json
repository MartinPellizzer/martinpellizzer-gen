    "intro": "Pimela denticulata, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a aquatic plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically narrow and serrated, which helps in reducing water resistance. Pimela denticulata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
