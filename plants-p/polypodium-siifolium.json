    "intro": "Polypodium siifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a single row along the stems. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
