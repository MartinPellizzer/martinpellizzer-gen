    "intro": "Potentilla caespitosa, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, mat-forming growth with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cymes. Its leaves are narrow, alternate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Potentilla caespitosa is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
