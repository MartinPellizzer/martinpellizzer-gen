    "intro": "Plantago elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters at the tips of the stems, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Plantago elongata thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
