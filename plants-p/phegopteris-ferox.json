    "intro": "Phegopteris ferox, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, robust fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
