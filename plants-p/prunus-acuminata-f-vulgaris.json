    "intro": "Prunus acuminata f. vulgaris, commonly known as the Chinese date or the wild date tree, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and ovate, glossy green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by small, round fruits that resemble dates in appearance. The fruit is edible when fully ripe, though it is often used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and compact size. It is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and prefers a sunny location."
