    "intro": "Plerandropsis, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plants are characterized by their striking yellow flowers with a star-shaped pattern, which gives them their common name. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Plerandropsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in greenhouses or as houseplants."
