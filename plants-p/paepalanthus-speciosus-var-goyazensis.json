It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
