    "intro": "Pedleya acanthoclada, commonly known as the rough-leaved pedleya, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and it produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Pedleya acanthoclada is relatively uncommon and has limited distribution, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
