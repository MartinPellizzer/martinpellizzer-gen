    "intro": "Pentadenia moesta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, tactile appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Pentadenia moesta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
