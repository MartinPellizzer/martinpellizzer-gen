    "intro": "Polypodium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive heart-shaped outline, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
