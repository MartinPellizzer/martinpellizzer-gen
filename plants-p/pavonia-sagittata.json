    "intro": "Pavonia sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink to red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native gardens and erosion control. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
