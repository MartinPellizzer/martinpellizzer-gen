    "intro": "Phoradendron martianum, commonly known as the Martian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Caribbean and Central America. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its unique parasitic growth habit."
