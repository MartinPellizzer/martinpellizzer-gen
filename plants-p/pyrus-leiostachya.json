    "intro": "Pyrus leiostachya, commonly known as the white-stamen pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by yellow, apple-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
