    "intro": "Panicum ciliatifolium, commonly known as the silky panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and delicate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its foliage is often described as silky to the touch due to the fine, ciliate (frayed) margins of the leaves. Panicum ciliatifolium is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils."
