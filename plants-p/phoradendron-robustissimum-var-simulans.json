    "intro": "Phoradendron robustissimum var. simulans, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Its sticky seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to propagate across different host trees. This species is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is often found in humid, forested environments."
