    "intro": "Pyrus cuneifolia var. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leafed pear, is a variant of the Chinese white pear. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to typical pear species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and fruit. This variety is adapted to temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil for optimal growth."
