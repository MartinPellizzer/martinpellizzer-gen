    "intro": "Pitcairnia lymansmithiana, commonly known as the Lymansmith's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water, a common adaptation in epiphytic plants. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
