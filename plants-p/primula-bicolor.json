It is characterized by its showy, bilaterally symmetric flowers that typically feature two distinct color zones, often white and purple or pink. The plant produces oval, hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
