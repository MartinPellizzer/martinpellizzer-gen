    "intro": "Pteris rufescens, commonly known as the rusty brake, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to brownish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pteris rufescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
