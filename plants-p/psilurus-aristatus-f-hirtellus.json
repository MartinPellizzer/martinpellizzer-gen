    "intro": "Psilurus aristatus f. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss species characterized by its distinctive hairy texture on its stems. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a low-growing, carpet-like growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, produce spores that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
