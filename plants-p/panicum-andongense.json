    "intro": "Panicum andongense, commonly known as the Andong grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
