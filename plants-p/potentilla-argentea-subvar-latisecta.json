    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subvar. latisecta, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape, with a distinctive, flat and wide structure. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
