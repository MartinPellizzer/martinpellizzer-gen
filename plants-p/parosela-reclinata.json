    "intro": "Parosela reclinata, commonly known as the drooping parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that hang downward. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue or violet. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela reclinata is considered a rare and endemic species."
