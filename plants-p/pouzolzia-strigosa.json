It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Pouzolzia strigosa is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
