    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. acutum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor the plant in soil while absorbing nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture."
