    "intro": "Pachystrobilus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, hairy appearance on the stems and leaves. Native to various regions of the Americas, this plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporophytic structures, including strobili, are essential for reproduction, producing spores that disperse via wind. The plant's morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to humid, temperate climates."
