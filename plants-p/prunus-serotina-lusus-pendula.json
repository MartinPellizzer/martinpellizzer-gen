It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark, edible cherries in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its overall botanical appeal."
