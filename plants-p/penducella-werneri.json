    "intro": "Penducella werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's penducel, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a pendulous cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
