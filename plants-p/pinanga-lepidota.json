    "intro": "Pinanga lepidota, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating, which gives it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, clustered in a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Pinanga lepidota is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
