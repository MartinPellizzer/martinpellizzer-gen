    "intro": "Panicum chiriquiense, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed grass, is a perennial grass native to Central America. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. It is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a resilient species. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
