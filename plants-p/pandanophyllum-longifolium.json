    "intro": "Pandanophyllum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved pandan, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional cooking. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The leaves are aromatic and contain essential oils that contribute to its culinary and medicinal uses."
