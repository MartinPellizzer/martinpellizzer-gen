    "intro": "Prunus ulei, commonly known as the Chinese bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus ulei is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
