    "intro": "Pedilochilus, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. They are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble butterflies, hence their common name. Pedilochilus species typically have a pseudobulb structure and produce intricate, fragrant blooms. They thrive in humid environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
