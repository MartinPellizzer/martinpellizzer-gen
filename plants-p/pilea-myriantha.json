    "intro": "Pilea myriantha, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to southern China and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that resemble small coins. The plant produces small, white, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a green spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea myriantha is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
