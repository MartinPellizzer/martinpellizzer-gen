    "intro": "Podopeltis sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous podopeltis, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded substrates. The plant exhibits a complex system of canals and lobes, which aid in water retention and gas exchange. Its distribution is primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid environments. Podopeltis sinuata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
