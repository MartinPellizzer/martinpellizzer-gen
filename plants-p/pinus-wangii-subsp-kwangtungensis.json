It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves. The cones are typically small and woody, containing two to three seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
