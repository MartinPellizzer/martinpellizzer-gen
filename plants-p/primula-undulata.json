    "intro": "Primula undulata, commonly known as the wavy primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces showy, wavy-edged petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair. Primula undulata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas."
