The plant has a straight, unbranched trunk and can grow up to 20 meters tall, making it a dominant feature in its native habitat. Its leaves are compound, with long, narrow leaflets, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates for its vibrant floral display."
