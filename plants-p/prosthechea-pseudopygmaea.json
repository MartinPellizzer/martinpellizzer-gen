    "intro": "Prosthechea pseudopygmaea, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has short, creeping stems and produces tiny, leathery leaves that help it thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters and are pollinated by small insects. Prosthechea pseudopygmaea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
