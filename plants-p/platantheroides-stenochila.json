    "intro": "Platantheroides stenochila, commonly known as the narrow-lobed bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in dense clusters. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
