    "intro": "Plectronia marquesensis var. acuta, commonly known as the Marquesas plectronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or white flowers, which are fragrant and attract various pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
