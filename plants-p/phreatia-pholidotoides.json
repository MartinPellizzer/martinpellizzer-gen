    "intro": "Phreatia pholidotoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in tropical rainforests. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
