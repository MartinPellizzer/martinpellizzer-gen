It belongs to the family Cyprinidae and is characterized by its slender body and distinctive spiny rays on its dorsal and anal fins. This species is typically found in slow-moving streams and rivers with sandy or muddy substrates. Its coloration is usually a dull silver with a faintly barred pattern. Due to habitat degradation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
