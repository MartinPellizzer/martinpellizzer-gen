    "intro": "Phyllitis ruta-muraria, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in early spring. Phyllitis ruta-muraria is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
