    "intro": "Prunus hyemalis, commonly known as the winter cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, red fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Prunus hyemalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and early blooming habit."
