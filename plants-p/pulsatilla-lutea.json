    "intro": "Pulsatilla lutea, commonly known as the meadow anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports a single, cup-shaped flower with numerous stamens. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Pulsatilla lutea is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands."
