It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a slightly hairy surface that aids in water retention."
