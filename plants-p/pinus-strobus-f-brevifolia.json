    "intro": "Pinus strobus f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaf white pine, is a natural variant of the eastern white pine. It is characterized by its shorter, more compact needles compared to the typical white pine. The foliage is dense, with needles that are typically 2 to 4 inches long, giving the tree a more rounded appearance. It produces cones that are smaller and more conical than those of the standard species. This form is often found in specific ecological niches, such as rocky or dry soils, where it exhibits greater hardiness."
