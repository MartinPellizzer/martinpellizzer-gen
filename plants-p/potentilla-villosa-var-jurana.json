    "intro": "Potentilla villosa var. jurana, commonly known as the Jurana cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture and are covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
