    "intro": "Polypodium loriforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, wavy margin. Polypodium loriforme thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
