    "intro": "Populus balsamifera f. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf balsam poplar, is a naturally occurring form of the balsam poplar. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. This variety typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. The leaves have a distinctive sweet, balsam-like scent when crushed, a trait shared with other members of the Populus genus. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a notable presence in its native habitat."
