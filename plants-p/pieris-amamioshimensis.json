    "intro": "Pieris amamioshimensis, commonly known as the Amami mitsumata, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Amami Islands in Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
