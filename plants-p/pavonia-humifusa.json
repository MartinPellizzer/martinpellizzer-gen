    "intro": "Pavonia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Pavonia humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
