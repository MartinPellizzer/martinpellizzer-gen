    "intro": "Poa lapponica subsp. acmocalyx, commonly known as the Arctic meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairless stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates and harsh environmental conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
