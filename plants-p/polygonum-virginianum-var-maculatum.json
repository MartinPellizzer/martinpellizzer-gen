It features upright, branching stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are ovate to lanceolate with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition from white to pink as they age, typically blooming from July to September. It thrives in moist to wet soils in full sun to partial shade, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed sites. Its showy inflorescences make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
