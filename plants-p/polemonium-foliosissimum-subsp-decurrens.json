    "intro": "Polemonium foliosissimum subsp. decurrens, commonly known as the spreading leaf phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, often hairy leaves that gradually transition into opposite, lance-shaped leaves along the stem. The plant produces clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland and forested habitats, making it a notable species in ecological studies."
