    "intro": "Pycreus nuerensis, commonly known as the Nuerensis pycreus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are typically opposite, simple, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pycreus nuerensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
