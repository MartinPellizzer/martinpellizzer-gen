    "intro": "Physocaulis, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Physocaulis species typically grow in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. They are carnivorous, relying on the trapped prey for nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. The genus includes around 40 species, many of which are found in temperate regions across the globe."
