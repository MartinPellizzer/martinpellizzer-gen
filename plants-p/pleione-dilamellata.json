    "intro": "Pleione dilamellata, commonly known as the Yunnan pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude forests of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its elegant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive greenish hue on the dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to anchor itself in rocky or forested soils, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
