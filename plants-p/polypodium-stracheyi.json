    "intro": "Polypodium stracheyi, commonly known as the Strachey's hart's tongue fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizome with broad, leathery, tongue-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and have a glossy appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium stracheyi is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types provided the conditions are suitable."
