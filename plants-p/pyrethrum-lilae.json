    "intro": "Pyrethrum lilae, commonly known as the lilac pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, tubular flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens. Pyrethrum lilae is also valued for its potential use in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrins in its flowers."
