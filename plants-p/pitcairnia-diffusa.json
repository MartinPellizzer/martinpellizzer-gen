    "intro": "Pitcairnia diffusa, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name, and it forms a rosette structure that collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia diffusa is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
