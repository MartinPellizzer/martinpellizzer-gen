    "intro": "Philodendron fragrantissimum, commonly known as the fragrant philodendron, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its name derives from the subtle, pleasant fragrance that can be detected when the leaves are touched or rubbed."
