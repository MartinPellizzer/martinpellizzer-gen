    "intro": "Perezia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered perezia, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Perezia grandifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
