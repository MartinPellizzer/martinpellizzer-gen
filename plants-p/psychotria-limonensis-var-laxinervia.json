    "intro": "Psychotria limonensis var. laxinervia, commonly known as the yellow psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves with prominent, reddish veins, which give it its varietal name \"laxinervia.\" It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant has been studied for its potential pharmacological properties due to the presence of alkaloids similar to those found in other species of the Psychotria genus."
