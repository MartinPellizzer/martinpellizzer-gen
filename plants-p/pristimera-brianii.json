    "intro": "Pristimera brianii, commonly known as the Brian's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and elongated, strap-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Pristimera brianii is considered critically endangered."
