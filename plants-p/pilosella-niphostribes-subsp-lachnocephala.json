    "intro": "Pilosella niphostribes subsp. lachnocephala, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-white woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
