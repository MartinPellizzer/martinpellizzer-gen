    "intro": "Pleurogramme linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaf pleurogramme, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Pleurogramme linearifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
