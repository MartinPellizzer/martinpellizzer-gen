    "intro": "Pinus corsicana, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds surrounded by a wing for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. The Corsican pine plays an important role in local ecosystems and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
