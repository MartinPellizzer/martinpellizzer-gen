    "intro": "Paepalanthus gneissicola, commonly known as the gneissicola cactus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique, globular shape and spiny appearance. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged form. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
