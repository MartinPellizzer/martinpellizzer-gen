    "intro": "Pontederia sagittata, commonly known as arrowhead, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped to arrow-shaped leaves that are typically floating or emergent, depending on water conditions. The plant produces striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments like ponds, marshes, and along stream edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
