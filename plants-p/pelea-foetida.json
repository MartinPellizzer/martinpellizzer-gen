    "intro": "Pelea foetida, commonly known as the stinking petiolar vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pungent odor, which is most noticeable when the leaves are crushed. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or red when mature. Pelea foetida is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
