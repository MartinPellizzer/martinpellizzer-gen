    "intro": "Pilosella aquilonaris, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it well adapted to high-altitude conditions. Pilosella aquilonaris plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
