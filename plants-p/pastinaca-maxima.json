    "intro": "Pastinaca maxima, commonly known as the Italian wax gourd, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is a climbing vine that produces large, elongated, pale green fruits with a waxy texture. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is typically harvested when immature for culinary use, though it can be left to mature into a fibrous, inedible fruit. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun."
