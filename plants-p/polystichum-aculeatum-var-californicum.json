    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. californicum, commonly known as the California holly fern, is a perennial fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its stiff, upright fronds with a leathery texture and spiny margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in compact, rounded clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
