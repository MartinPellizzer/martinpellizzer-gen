    "intro": "Phleum alpinum var. tenue, commonly known as Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in harsh climates."
