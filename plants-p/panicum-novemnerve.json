    "intro": "Panicum novemnerve, commonly known as the nine-veined panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a prominent central vein. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds, which are typically wind-dispersed. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides in its natural range."
