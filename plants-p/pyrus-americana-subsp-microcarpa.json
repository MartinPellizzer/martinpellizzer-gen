    "intro": "Pyrus americana subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf crabapple, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, tart apples that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and resilience to urban conditions."
