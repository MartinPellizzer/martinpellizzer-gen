    "intro": "Pithecoctenium cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a dense rosette, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by water or animals. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
