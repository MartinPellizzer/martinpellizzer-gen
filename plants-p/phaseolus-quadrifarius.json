    "intro": "Phaseolus quadrifarius, commonly known as the four-leaf bean, is a climbing legume native to Central and South America. It produces small, oval-shaped pods that contain several edible seeds, typically with a mild, nutty flavor. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Phaseolus. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a useful companion plant in sustainable agriculture."
