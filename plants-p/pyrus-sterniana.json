    "intro": "Pyrus sterniana, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Pyrus sterniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold climates."
