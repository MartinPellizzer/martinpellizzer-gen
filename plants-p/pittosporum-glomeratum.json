    "intro": "Pittosporum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant foliage and clusters of white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has dark green, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces small, black, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. Pittosporum glomeratum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
