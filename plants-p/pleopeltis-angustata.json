    "intro": "Pleopeltis angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its leaves are often divided into narrow, linear segments. Pleopeltis angustata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
