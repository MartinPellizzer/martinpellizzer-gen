    "intro": "Panax suborbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive round or suborbicular-shaped leaves, which give it its scientific name. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its root system is similar to other ginseng species, though it is less commercially cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panax suborbicularis is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
