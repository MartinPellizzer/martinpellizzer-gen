    "intro": "Paepalanthus vaginans, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in countries like Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. This plant is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
