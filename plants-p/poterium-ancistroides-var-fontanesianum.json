It is characterized by its striking, bottle-shaped inflorescences that resemble brushes, composed of dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive floral display."
