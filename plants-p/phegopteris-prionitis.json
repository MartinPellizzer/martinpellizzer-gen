    "intro": "Phegopteris prionitis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that helps it absorb nutrients from the water. Phegopteris prionitis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
