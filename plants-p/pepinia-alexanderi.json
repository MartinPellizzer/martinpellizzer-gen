    "intro": "Pepinia alexanderi, commonly known as Alexander's pepinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a small, herbaceous perennial with delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
