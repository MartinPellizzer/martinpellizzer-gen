    "intro": "Potentilla hirta subvar. subsericea, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and covered in fine, soft hairs. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments."
