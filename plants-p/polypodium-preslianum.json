    "intro": "Polypodium preslianum, commonly known as the Preslia's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which are responsible for spore production. The leaves are usually green and have a leathery texture, adapting to its humid habitat."
