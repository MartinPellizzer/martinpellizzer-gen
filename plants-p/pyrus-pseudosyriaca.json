    "intro": "Pyrus pseudosyriaca, commonly known as the Syrian pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown with dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Its botanical characteristics include a smooth, greyish-brown bark and a preference for well-drained, loamy soils. Pyrus pseudosyriaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional horticulture."
