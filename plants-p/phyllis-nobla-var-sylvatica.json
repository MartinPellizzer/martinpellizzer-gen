    "intro": "Phyllis nobla var. sylvatica, commonly known as the forest phyllis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland understories."
