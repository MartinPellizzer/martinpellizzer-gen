    "intro": "Pittosporum gayanum f. waialealae, commonly known as the Waialeale Pittosporum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the cloud forests of Kauai's mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
