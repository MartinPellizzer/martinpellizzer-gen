It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is considered rare in the wild."
