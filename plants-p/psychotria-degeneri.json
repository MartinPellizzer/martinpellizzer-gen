    "intro": "Psychotria degeneri, commonly known as the \"devil's breath\" or \"mad hatter's plant,\" is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It contains psychoactive alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contribute to its reputation as a hallucinogenic plant. Due to its potent effects and legal status, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for research or ceremonial purposes."
