It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact and ornamental appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to alpine and subalpine habitats."
