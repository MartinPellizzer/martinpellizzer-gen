    "intro": "Pyrus tremulans, commonly known as the quaking aspen, is a deciduous tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often trembling branches that give it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have finely serrated margins. Pyrus tremulans plays an important ecological role, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
