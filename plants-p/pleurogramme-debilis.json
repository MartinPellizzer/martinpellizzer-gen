    "intro": "Pleurogramme debilis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into narrow, linear segments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pleurogramme debilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
