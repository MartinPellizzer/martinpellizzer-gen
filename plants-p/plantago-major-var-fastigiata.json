    "intro": "Plantago major var. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its more upright growth habit compared to the typical spreading form. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces capsules that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
