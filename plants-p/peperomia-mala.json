    "intro": "Peperomia mala, commonly known as the \"devil's backbone,\" is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that resemble a spine, hence its common name. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly waxy texture. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Peperomia mala is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light conditions."
