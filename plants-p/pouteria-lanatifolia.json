    "intro": "Pouteria lanatifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are alternate along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, and essential minerals. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
