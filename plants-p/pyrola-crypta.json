    "intro": "Pyrola crypta, commonly known as the ghost pepper or the cryptic pyrola, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the understory of temperate forests in North America. It is characterized by its small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its dark, glossy leaves that help it absorb limited sunlight. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soil and requires a cool, shaded environment to flourish. Pyrola crypta is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
