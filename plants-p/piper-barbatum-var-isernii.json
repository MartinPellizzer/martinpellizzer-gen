    "intro": "Piper barbatum var. isernii, commonly known as the Isern's pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern, and its small, clustered flowers that range from green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when mature, though they may turn red or black depending on the variety. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens and used in traditional medicine."
