    "intro": "Phaseolus metcalfei, commonly known as the Mexican coffee bean or coffee bean plant, is a species of legume native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, green pods that contain one to three seeds, which are often referred to as coffee beans despite not being related to true coffee. These seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, and the plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility. Its cultivation is often associated with traditional agricultural practices in its native regions."
