    "intro": "Prunus padus lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that drape like a veil. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically pink or white, followed by edible drupes that mature to a dark purple color. Its unique form makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade to thrive. The plant is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
