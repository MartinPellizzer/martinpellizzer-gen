    "intro": "Podostemum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows along the edges of slow-moving rivers and lakes, with its roots submerged and leaves emerging above the water surface. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are typically greenish-white in color. Podostemum rigidum plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
