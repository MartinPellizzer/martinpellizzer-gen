    "intro": "Pteris pellucida, commonly known as the water fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are also used as a natural indicator of water quality due to their sensitivity to environmental changes."
