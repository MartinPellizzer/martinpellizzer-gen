    "intro": "Polypodium leuconeurum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish tint. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
