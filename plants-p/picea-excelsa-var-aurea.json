    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. aurea, commonly known as the golden spruce, is a rare and striking variant of the Sitka spruce. It is characterized by its golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts vividly with its dark green needles. This unique coloration is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and thrives in moist, cool climates. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a living relic and a subject of botanical study."
