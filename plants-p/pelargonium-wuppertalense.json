It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The flowers are borne in terminal clusters and are usually pink to red in color, with five petals and a prominent calyx. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and foliage."
