    "intro": "Paspalum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are often heart-shaped at the base, giving it its common name. Paspalum cordatum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
