    "intro": "Puya bicolor, commonly known as the Andean flamingo flower, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant features broad, strap-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. Its most notable feature is the showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Puya bicolor is known for its slow growth and long flowering period, making it a unique and eye-catching addition to botanical gardens."
