    "intro": "Psychotria tetramera, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"crown of thorns,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep violet. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the leaf axils. Psychotria tetramera is also notable for containing alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal and psychoactive properties."
