It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and its striking purple-pink flower plumes that appear in the summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Pennisetum hirsutum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
