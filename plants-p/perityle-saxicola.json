    "intro": "Perityle saxicola, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with basal leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth form and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it well adapted to its ecological niche. Perityle saxicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and provides nectar for pollinators."
