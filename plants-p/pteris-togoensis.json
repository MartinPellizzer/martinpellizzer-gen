    "intro": "Pteris togoensis, commonly known as Togo water fern, is a species of fern native to West Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris togoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
