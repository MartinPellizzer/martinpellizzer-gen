    "intro": "Pinus thelemannii, commonly known as the Tepui pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and contain seeds surrounded by a papery covering. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
