    "intro": "Potentilla rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Potentilla rotundifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
