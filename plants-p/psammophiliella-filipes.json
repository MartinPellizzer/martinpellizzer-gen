    "intro": "Psammophiliella filipes, commonly known as the sand holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, reducing water loss through transpiration. Psammophiliella filipes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife."
