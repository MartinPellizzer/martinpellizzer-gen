    "intro": "Panicum pubivaginatum, commonly known as the velvet foxtail, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and spikelets that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
