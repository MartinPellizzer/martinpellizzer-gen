    "intro": "Puya pastoensis, commonly known as the Pasto puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves form a rosette structure that collects rainwater, aiding in its survival in high-altitude environments. Puya pastoensis is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its ecological importance in its native habitat."
