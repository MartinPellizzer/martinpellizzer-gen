    "intro": "Panicum tenuissimum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches and has fine, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in grasses. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and disturbed areas. Its delicate appearance and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
