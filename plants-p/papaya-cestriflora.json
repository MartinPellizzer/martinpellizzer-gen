It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and distinctive, hairy fruit that resembles a papaya but is typically smaller. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is edible, with a sweet and fibrous flesh, and is rich in enzymes like papain. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value."
