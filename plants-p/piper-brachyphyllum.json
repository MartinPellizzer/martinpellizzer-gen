    "intro": "Piper brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-stemmed pepper plant, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically harvested when they turn red, though they may remain green depending on the variety. It belongs to the Piper genus, which includes many pepper species used in culinary and medicinal contexts. The botanical features of Piper brachyphyllum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and potential use in traditional medicine."
