    "intro": "Pityrocarpa constricta, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Pityrocarpa constricta plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
