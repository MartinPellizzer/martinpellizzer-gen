    "intro": "Poa roemeri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in high-elevation habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous slender, blue-violet flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Poa roemeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
