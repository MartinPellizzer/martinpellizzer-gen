    "intro": "Pessopteris carinata, commonly known as the ridge fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a prominent midrib and a serrated margin. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, tropical environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
