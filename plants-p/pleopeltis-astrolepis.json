    "intro": "Pleopeltis astrolepis, commonly known as the star-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often deeply lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds."
