    "intro": "Poa muktinathensis, commonly known as the Muktinath grass, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Nepal. It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like structure and tufted growth habit. This plant thrives in cold, alpine environments, typically at elevations above 4,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Poa muktinathensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
