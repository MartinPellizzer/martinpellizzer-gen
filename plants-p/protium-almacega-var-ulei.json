    "intro": "Protium almacega var. ulei, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, simple leaves that are alternate and often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and wood have historically been valued for their durability and fine grain, though overharvesting has led to conservation concerns."
