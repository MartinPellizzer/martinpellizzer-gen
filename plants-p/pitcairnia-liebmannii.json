    "intro": "Pitcairnia liebmannii, commonly known as the Liebmann's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often resembling flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
