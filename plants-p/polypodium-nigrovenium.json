    "intro": "Polypodium nigrovenium, commonly known as the black-veined polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with prominent, dark veins. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium nigrovenium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
