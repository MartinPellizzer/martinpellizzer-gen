    "intro": "Pilea mornicola, commonly known as the morning glory pilea, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight reddish tint. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the early morning hours. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea mornicola is a low-maintenance plant that is popular among indoor gardeners for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
