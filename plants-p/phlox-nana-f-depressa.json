    "intro": "Phlox nana f. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf phlox or low phlox, is a compact, mat-forming perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features dense clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves and a low-growing habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
