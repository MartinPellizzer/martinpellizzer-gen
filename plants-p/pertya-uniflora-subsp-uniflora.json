    "intro": "Pertya uniflora subsp. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower pertya, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
