It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. It is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Psychotria terminalis is often found in humid, shaded environments within rainforests."
