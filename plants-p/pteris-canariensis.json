    "intro": "Pteris canariensis, commonly known as the Canary brake fern, is a species of fern native to the Canary Islands and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are dark green and often have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in rocky soils or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Pteris canariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
