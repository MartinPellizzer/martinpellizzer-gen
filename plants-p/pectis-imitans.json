It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. Pectis imitans is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in disturbed environments."
