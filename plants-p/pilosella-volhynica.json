    "intro": "Pilosella volhynica, commonly known as the Volhynian hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It features basal leaves that are hairy and lobed, with yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Pilosella volhynica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
