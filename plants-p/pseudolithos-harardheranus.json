    "intro": "Pseudolithos harardheranus, commonly known as the Harardheran stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, thick leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and reducing water loss. Pseudolithos harardheranus is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xerophytic gardens."
