    "intro": "Photinia arbutifolia, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is noted for its striking foliage, which turns vibrant red or orange in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
