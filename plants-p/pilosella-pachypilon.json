    "intro": "Pilosella pachypilon, commonly known as the woolly pincushion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant is notable for its dense, white to grayish-white fuzzy hairs covering its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. It produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets, which are typically white or pale yellow. Pilosella pachypilon thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it is often found in disturbed soils."
