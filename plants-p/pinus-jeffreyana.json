    "intro": "Pinus jeffreyana, commonly known as Jeffery pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for many years. Jeffery pine thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
