    "intro": "Protea diversifolia, commonly known as the Cape protea, is a striking plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a member of the Proteaceae family, known for its showy, inflorescence-like structures called proteas. The plant features a woody stem with a dense, spherical head of bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. Its blooms come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and red, and are often used in floral arrangements. Protea diversifolia thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in Mediterranean climates."
