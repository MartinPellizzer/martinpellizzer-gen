    "intro": "Polycarpaea teneriffae var. crassifolia, commonly known as the Canary Island geranium, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for Mediterranean and subtropical climates."
