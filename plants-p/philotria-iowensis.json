    "intro": "Philotria iowensis, commonly known as Iowa filotria, is a rare flowering plant native to the midwestern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Philotria iowensis is considered endangered due to habitat loss and is protected in several states."
