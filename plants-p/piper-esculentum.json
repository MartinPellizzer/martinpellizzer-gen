    "intro": "Piper esculentum, commonly known as the pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, berry-like fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These fruits are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to their pungent flavor. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies."
