    "intro": "Polygonum molle, commonly known as soft knotweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and streambanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a common weed and a valuable plant for erosion control. Its botanical name reflects its soft, delicate appearance and its membership in the Polygonaceae family."
