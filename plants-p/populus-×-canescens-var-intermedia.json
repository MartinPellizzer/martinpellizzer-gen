It is a hybrid deciduous tree native to North America, characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant is part of the Salicaceae family and is known for its ability to form extensive clonal colonies through root sprouting. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it relies on wind pollination. The species is valued for its rapid growth and is often used in reforestation and phytoremediation efforts."
