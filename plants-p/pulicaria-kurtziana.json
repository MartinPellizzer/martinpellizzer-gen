    "intro": "Pulicaria kurtziana, commonly known as the Kashmir mullein, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
