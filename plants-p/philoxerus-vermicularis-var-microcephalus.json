    "intro": "Philoxerus vermicularis var. microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf leafy spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
