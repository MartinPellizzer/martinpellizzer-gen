    "intro": "Phaca uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Russia. It typically grows in wet, boggy areas and is characterized by its slender stems and small, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and possesses lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Phaca uralensis is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
