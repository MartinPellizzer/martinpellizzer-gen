    "intro": "Prunus domestica var. vinaria, commonly known as the wine grape tree, is a variety of European plum that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with a compact growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are typically used for winemaking due to their high sugar and tannin content. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The flowers are white and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge."
