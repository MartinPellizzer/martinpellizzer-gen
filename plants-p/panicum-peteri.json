It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often pale green to brown in color. Panicum peteri thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dryland environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its fine texture and drought tolerance."
