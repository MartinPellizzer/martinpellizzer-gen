    "intro": "Pseudostellaria japonica, commonly known as Japanese starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to soil stabilization in its native habitat. Pseudostellaria japonica is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
