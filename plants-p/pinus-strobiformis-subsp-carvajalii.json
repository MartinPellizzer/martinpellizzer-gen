    "intro": "Pinus strobiformis subsp. carvajalii, commonly known as the Carvajal\u2019s pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and distinctive cone morphology. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its cones are often reddish-brown and contain two-winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
