    "intro": "Podolobium coriaceum, commonly known as the rough podolobium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seed pods are hard and woody, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals. Podolobium coriaceum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
