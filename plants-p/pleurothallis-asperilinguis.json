    "intro": "Pleurothallis asperilinguis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with a purple or brown stripe. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
