    "intro": "Portea legrelliana, commonly known as the golden star hibiscus, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically green with a prominent yellow or white vein pattern. The plant produces showy, hibiscus-like flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, often with a contrasting central spot. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Portea legrelliana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
