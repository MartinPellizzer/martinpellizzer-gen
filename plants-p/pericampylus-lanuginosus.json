It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
