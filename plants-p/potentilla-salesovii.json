It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves with five leaflets. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold climates. It is often found in meadows and on slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
