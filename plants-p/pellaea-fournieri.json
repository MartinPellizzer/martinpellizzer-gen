    "intro": "Pellaea fournieri, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that display a striking golden hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Pellaea fournieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
