    "intro": "Plectomirtha, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Plectomirtha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
