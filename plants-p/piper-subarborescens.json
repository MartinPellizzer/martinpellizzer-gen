    "intro": "Piper subarborescens, commonly known as the white pepper plant, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, woody fruits. The seeds inside the fruits are harvested and ground to produce white pepper, a spice widely used in cooking. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth."
