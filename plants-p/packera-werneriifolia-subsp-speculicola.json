    "intro": "Packera werneriifolia subsp. speculicola, commonly known as the rock spirea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower heads in the spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
