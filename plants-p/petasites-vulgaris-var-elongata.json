    "intro": "Petasites vulgaris var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by distinctive, elongated, spiny fruits. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a valuable indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
