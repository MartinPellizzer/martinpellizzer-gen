    "intro": "Physalis walteri var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth husk tomato, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, though the variety 'glabra' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, papery calyces surrounding the fruit. The fruit is typically a small, orange-red berry that ripens in late summer. It is native to the southwestern United States and is often found in arid or semi-arid habitats."
