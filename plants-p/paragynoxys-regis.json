It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
