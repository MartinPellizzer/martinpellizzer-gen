    "intro": "Pilosella farinoderma, commonly known as the silky weed or farinose hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has hairy, sometimes woolly leaves and stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Pilosella farinoderma is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
