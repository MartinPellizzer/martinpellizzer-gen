    "intro": "Pyrus villosula, commonly known as the hairy pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits resembling small pears. Pyrus villosula thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and edible fruits make it a notable species in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
