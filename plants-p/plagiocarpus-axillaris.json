    "intro": "Plagiocarpus axillaris, commonly known as the slender false sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or yellow in color. Its fruits are follicles that contain seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in some areas."
