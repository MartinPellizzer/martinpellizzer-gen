    "intro": "Pimpinella robusta, commonly known as the robust hogweed, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and can grow up to several meters in height. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially hazardous plant."
