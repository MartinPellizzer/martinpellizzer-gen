    "intro": "Psyllium scabrum subsp. orientale, commonly known as Indian psyllium, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain fine, mucilaginous seeds, which are widely used in traditional medicine and as a dietary supplement. These seeds are rich in soluble fiber and are known for their ability to absorb water, forming a gel-like substance. The botanical features of this plant make it valuable for both medicinal and agricultural applications."
