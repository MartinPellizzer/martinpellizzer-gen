    "intro": "Periboea brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved periboea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
