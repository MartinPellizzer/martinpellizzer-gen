It features trailing stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically violet or blue, with a distinctive calyx that remains prominent even after the petals fall off. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil. This variety is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to cascade from containers or hanging baskets."
