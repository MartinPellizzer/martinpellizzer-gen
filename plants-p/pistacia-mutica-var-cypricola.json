    "intro": "Pistacia mutica var. cypricola, commonly known as the Cyprus pistache, is a variant of the pistacia tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, rough, and typically grayish or reddish bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by wind, followed by the development of edible, nut-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive waxy coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit."
