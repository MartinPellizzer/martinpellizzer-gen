    "intro": "Pediocactus simpsonii var. nigrispinus, commonly known as Simpson's night-spined cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its dark purple to black spines, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a short, thick body and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. Native to the arid regions of Baja California, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
