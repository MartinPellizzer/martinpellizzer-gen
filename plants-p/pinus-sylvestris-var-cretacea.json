    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. cretacea, commonly known as the Cretan pine, is a rare variant of the Scots pine. It is native to the island of Crete in Greece, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The tree is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Scots pine. Its cones are small and usually remain closed for a long time, a feature that helps it adapt to its arid environment. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
