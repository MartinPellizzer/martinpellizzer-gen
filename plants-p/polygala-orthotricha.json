    "intro": "Polygala orthotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
