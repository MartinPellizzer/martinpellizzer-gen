    "intro": "Pachira carolinea, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and its striking, pendulous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pachira carolinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
