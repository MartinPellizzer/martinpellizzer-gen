    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. caespitosa, commonly known as the mountain cherry or dwarf cherry, is a compact, shrub-like form of the Japanese cherry. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
