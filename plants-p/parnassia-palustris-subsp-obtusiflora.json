    "intro": "Parnassia palustris subsp. obtusiflora, commonly known as the blunt-flowered white crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate, waxy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
