    "intro": "Pleurothyrium cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pleurothyrium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers with five petals. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
