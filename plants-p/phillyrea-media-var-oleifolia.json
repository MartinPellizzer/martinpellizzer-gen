It features small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is valued for its aromatic foliage and its ability to thrive in poor, dry soils. Phillyrea media var. oleifolia is often used in hedges and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
