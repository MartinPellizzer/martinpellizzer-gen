    "intro": "Pandanus brownii, commonly known as the New Zealand pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces large, spadix-like inflorescences that are often used in traditional crafts. Its leaves are fibrous and can be woven into mats and baskets. Pandanus brownii thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing near the shoreline."
