    "intro": "Pinus krempfii var. poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of southeastern France. It is a variant of the Krempf's pine, characterized by its unique foliage and cone morphology. The leaves are typically needle-like, arranged in fascicles of five, and exhibit a bluish-green hue. The cones are small, woody, and often persist on the tree for several years. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and distinct genetic traits."
