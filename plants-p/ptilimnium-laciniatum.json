    "intro": "Ptilimnium laciniatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved ptilimnium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely dissected, lance-shaped leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in loose clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Ptilimnium laciniatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
