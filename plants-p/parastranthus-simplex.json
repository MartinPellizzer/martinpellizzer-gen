    "intro": "Parastranthus simplex, commonly known as the common sandthorn, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and spiny stems, which are adaptations to its arid environment. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
