    "intro": "Pereskia longispina, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a shrub-like plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered with spines. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are typically modified into spiny structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pereskia longispina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal areas."
