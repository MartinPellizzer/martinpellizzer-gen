    "intro": "Pteris macrodon, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae, which help in increasing surface area for photosynthesis. Pteris macrodon is also noted for its ability to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
