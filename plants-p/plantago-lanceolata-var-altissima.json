    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. altissima, commonly known as the tall plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its taller stature and broader leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are followed by distinctive, oval-shaped seed capsules. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
