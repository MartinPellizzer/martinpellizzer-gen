    "intro": "Pandanus aoraiensis, commonly known as the Aorai palm, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by ornamental fruits that are often used in traditional crafts. It thrives in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and humid environments. The Aorai palm is valued both for its aesthetic appeal and its cultural significance in Polynesian communities."
