    "intro": "Pleurothallis emarginata, commonly known as the Margined Lady's Slipper, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. This species is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green, often with a distinctive lip that is slightly notched or emarginate, giving it its scientific name. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Its botanical features make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
