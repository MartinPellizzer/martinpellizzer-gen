    "intro": "Pyrethrum pamiricum, commonly known as the Pamir pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which are the primary source of its natural insecticidal compounds. These compounds, known as pyrethrins, are effective against a wide range of pests. Pyrethrum pamiricum is valued for its ecological benefits and is used in organic pest control due to its low toxicity to mammals and beneficial insects."
