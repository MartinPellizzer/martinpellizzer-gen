    "intro": "Polystichum schkuhrii, commonly known as the Schkuhri\u2019s wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum schkuhrii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
