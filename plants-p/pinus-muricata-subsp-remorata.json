    "intro": "Pinus muricata subsp. remorata, commonly known as the coastal Douglas fir, is a subspecies native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous cones and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the main species. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming thicker and furrowed with age. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
