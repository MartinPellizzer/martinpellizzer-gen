    "intro": "Pyrus alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that resemble those of alder trees. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pome fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Pyrus alnifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
