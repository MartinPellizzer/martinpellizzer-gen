    "intro": "Psoralea divaricata, commonly known as the variable psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on elongated peduncles. Its seeds are enclosed in small, flat pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Psoralea divaricata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
