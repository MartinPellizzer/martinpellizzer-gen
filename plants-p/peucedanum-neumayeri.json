    "intro": "Peucedanum neumayeri, commonly known as the Neumayer's angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is known for its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other angelica species. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
