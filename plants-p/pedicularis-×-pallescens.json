    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 pallescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to alpine regions of Europe and is often found growing on the stems of other plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many areas."
