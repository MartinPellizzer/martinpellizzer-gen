It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon cephalanthus is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
