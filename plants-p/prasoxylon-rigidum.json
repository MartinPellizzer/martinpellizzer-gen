    "intro": "Prasoxylon rigidum, commonly known as the rigid wood plant, is a unique species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Prasoxylon rigidum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
