    "intro": "Photinia notoniana, commonly known as the Natal photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn red or bronze in the autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Photinia notoniana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
