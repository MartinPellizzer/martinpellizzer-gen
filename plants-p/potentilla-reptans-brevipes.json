    "intro": "Potentilla reptans brevipes, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in landscaping."
