    "intro": "Pyrus serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated-leaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar to common pears but are less widely cultivated. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and is sometimes grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
