    "intro": "Pedicularis sanguilimbata, commonly known as the blood-red lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Himalayas. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic growth habits, though it can sometimes photosynthesize. The plant features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often hairy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Pedicularis sanguilimbata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its ecological role and conservation status remain areas of ongoing study."
