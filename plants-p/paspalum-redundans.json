    "intro": "Paspalum redundans, commonly known as Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its tolerance for waterlogged soils, it plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting wetland ecosystems."
