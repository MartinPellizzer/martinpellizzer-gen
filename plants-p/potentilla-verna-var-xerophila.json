It typically features small, yellow flowers and has a compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptations to cold, dry climates."
