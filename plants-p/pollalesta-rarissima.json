    "intro": "Pollalesta rarissima, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its delicate, white flowers resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has very specific environmental requirements, making it highly sensitive to changes in its habitat. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
