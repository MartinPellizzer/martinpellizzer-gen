    "intro": "Piper plantagineum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or wild pepper, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and are followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. Piper plantagineum is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
