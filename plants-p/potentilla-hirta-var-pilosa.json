    "intro": "Potentilla hirta var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
