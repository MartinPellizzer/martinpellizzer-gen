    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides f. spathiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
