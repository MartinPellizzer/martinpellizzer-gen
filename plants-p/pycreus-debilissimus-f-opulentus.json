It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped with a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
