    "intro": "Platanthera elliptica var. longicalcarata, commonly known as the long-fruited marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, leafy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in environments with ample sunlight. Its unique feature is the elongated, club-shaped fruit that remains attached to the plant for an extended period. This variety is often found in prairie wetlands and is an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed ecosystems."
