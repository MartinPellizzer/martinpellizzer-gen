    "intro": "Polypodium hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 inches, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
