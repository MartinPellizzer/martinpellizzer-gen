    "intro": "Polium luteum, commonly known as yellow dogstail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with a yellowish hue, particularly at the base. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Polium luteum is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
