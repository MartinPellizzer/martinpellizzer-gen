    "intro": "Pyrus dracofolia, commonly known as the dragon's leaf pear, is a rare and ornamental species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed leaves that resemble dragon scales, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic value."
