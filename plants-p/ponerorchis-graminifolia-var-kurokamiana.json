    "intro": "Ponerorchis graminifolia var. kurokamiana, commonly known as the Kurokamiana marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, white mycorrhizal sheath, which is a key feature of its botanical structure. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
