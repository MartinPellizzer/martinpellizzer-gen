    "intro": "Perlebia pottsii var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated perlebia, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to specific regions in Africa. This plant is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are typically small, tubular, and come in shades of pink or white, with a distinctive corolla that is often split into five lobes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in specialized botanical gardens."
