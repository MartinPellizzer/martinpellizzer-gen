    "intro": "Polypodium subtaeniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Polypodium subtaeniatum reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori on the underside of its fronds."
