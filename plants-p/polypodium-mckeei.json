    "intro": "Polypodium mckeei, commonly known as the Mckee's sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Polypodium mckeei plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
