    "intro": "Pyrus chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the northern regions of Pakistan, particularly the Chitral Valley, and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its deciduous leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
