    "intro": "Pandanus montaguei, commonly known as the Montague's pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, followed by edible, fibrous fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing near the shoreline or in wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or for its practical uses in local communities."
