    "intro": "Pachyrhynchus, commonly known as the broad-nosed weevil, is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Curculionidae. These insects are characterized by their distinctive, elongated bodies and broad, rounded snouts. They are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they feed on a variety of plant materials. The larvae of Pachyrhynchus species often develop in the roots or stems of host plants, causing damage to crops and ornamental plants. Due to their feeding habits, some species are considered agricultural pests."
