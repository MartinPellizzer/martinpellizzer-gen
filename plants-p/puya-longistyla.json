    "intro": "Puya longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red and orange bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to its nectar-rich structure. Its leaves are long, narrow, and form a rosette that collects rainwater, supporting a diverse array of epiphytic organisms. Puya longistyla is also notable for its ability to survive in high-altitude environments with low temperatures and intense sunlight."
