    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris sinica, commonly known as the Chinese false fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across eastern Asia. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Pseudocystopteris sinica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
