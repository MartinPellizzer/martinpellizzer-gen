    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. calabrica, commonly known as the Calabrian stone pine, is a variety of the stone pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slow growth and distinctive, thick, scaly bark that provides protection against fire and drought. The tree produces edible pine nuts, which are an important food source in some Mediterranean cultures. Its needle-like leaves are dark green and persist for several years before shedding. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, compact form and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
