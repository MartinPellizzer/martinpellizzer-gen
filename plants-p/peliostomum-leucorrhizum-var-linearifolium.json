    "intro": "Peliostomum leucorrhizum var. linearifolium, commonly known as the linear-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive white, waxy coating that aids in light reflection. The plant produces small, white flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively through waterways. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes."
