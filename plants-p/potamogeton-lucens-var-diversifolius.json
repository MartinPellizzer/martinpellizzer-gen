It has long, narrow leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. This variety is distinguished by its variability in leaf shape and size, which can change depending on environmental conditions."
