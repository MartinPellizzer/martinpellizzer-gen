It features slender, ascending stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted to thrive in woodland and moist meadow habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
