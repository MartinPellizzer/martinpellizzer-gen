    "intro": "Potentilla griffithii var. metallica, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting foliage."
