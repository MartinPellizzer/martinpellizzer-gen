    "intro": "Poa canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for ecological restoration projects."
