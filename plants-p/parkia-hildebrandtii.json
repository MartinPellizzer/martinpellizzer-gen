    "intro": "Parkia hildebrandtii, commonly known as the African velvet tamarind, is a leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
