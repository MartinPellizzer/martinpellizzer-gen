    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. contorta, commonly known as the contorted cherry, is a unique cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches that create an irregular, sculptural appearance. This form is a result of natural mutations or grafting techniques that alter the plant's growth pattern. The plant typically produces small, pink to white flowers in spring, followed by red or black berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its distinctive shape and seasonal beauty."
