It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.
