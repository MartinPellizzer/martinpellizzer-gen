    "intro": "Polylophium panjutinii, commonly known as the Panjutinii's fern, is a rare and lesser-known species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
