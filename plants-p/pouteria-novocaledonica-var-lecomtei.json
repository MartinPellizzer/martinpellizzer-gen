    "intro": "Pouteria novocaledonica var. lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's pouteria, is a rare rainforest tree native to New Caledonia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and rugged, often with a faintly aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
