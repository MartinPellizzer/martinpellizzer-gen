    "intro": "Pteris excelsa var. fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
