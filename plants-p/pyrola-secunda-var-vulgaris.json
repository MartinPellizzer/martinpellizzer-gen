    "intro": "Pyrola secunda var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and azaleas, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Pyrola secunda var. vulgaris is also known for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving it its characteristic wintergreen scent."
