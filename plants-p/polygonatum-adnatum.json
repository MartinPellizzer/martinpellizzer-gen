It features rhizomatous stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbellate clusters during the summer months. Its flowers are followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. Polygonatum adnatum is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
