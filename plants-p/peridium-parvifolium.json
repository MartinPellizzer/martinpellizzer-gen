    "intro": "Peridium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf peridium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and small, elliptical leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments, including its ability to retain moisture and resist intense sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
