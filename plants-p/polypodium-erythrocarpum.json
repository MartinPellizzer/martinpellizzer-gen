    "intro": "Polypodium erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the margins of its fertile fronds, which are typically found on the upper surfaces. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. The red-fruited fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
