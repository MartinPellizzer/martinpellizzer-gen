    "intro": "Paspalum membranaceum var. aequiglume, commonly known as the narrowleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, low-growing growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for use in native landscapes and erosion control. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to form dense mats and its role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
