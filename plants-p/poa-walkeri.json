    "intro": "Poa walkeri, commonly known as the Walker's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to cold climates and requires well-drained soils to thrive. Poa walkeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
