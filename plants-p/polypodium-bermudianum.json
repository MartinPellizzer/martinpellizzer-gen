    "intro": "Polypodium bermudianum, commonly known as the Bermuda polypody, is a small, evergreen fern native to Bermuda and the West Indies. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, clustered growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often recurved. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
