    "intro": "Polypodium percussum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often as an epiphyte. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polypodium percussum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
