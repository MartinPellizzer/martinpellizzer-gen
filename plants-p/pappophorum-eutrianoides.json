    "intro": "Pappophorum eutrianoides, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
