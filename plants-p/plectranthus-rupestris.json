    "intro": "Plectranthus rupestris, commonly known as the stone plant or rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white or grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-draining soil. Plectranthus rupestris is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage."
