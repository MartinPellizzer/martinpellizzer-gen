    "intro": "Pitcairnia orgyalis, commonly known as the Royal Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from red to orange. Its foliage is often covered in a dense, woolly coating that aids in moisture retention. Pitcairnia orgyalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
