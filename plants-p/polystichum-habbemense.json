    "intro": "Polystichum habbemense, commonly known as the Habbemense shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows along the veins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum habbemense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
