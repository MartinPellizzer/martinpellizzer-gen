    "intro": "Pholidocarpus rumphii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and typically have a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. This species is also noted for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, making it an important component of tropical rainforest ecosystems."
