    "intro": "Potentilla verna f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. This variety is distinguished by its glandular structures on both the leaves and stems, contributing to its unique appearance and ecological role."
