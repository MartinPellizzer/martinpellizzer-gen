    "intro": "Polystichum brassii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically upright and stiff. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum brassii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, cool conditions."
