It features small, rounded leaves that are often densely packed, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in late summer, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits. It is well-suited for small spaces due to its compact growth habit. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and hardiness in various garden settings."
