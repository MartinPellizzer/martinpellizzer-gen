    "intro": "Phegopteris anomala, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a distinctive, deeply divided structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are capable of photosynthesis and can also absorb dissolved nutrients, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
