    "intro": "Physematium manchuriense, commonly known as the Manchurian false hellebore, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the arum family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
