    "intro": "Polypodium ludovicianum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to North America. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops, cliffs, and in shaded forest areas. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces fronds that are usually lanceolate in shape. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polypodium ludovicianum is often found in moist, acidic soils and can thrive in a variety of microhabitats."
