    "intro": "Pyrus vallerubusensis, commonly known as the Vallerubus apple, is a rare species of apple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly serrated. Its flowers are white and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pyrus vallerubusensis is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and plant enthusiasts."
