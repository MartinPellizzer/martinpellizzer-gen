    "intro": "Phlox missourica, commonly known as Missouri phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central United States. It typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of rhizomes and fibrous roots, which help it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Missouri phlox is often found in woodland edges, prairies, and along stream banks."
