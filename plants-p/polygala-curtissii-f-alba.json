    "intro": "Polygala curtissii f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of Texas. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
