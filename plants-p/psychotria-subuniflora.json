    "intro": "Psychotria subuniflora, commonly known as the \"single-flower psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, and its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
