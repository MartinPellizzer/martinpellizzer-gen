    "intro": "Pilea distachys, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that features rosettes of thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, round, papery seed capsules. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and ability to propagate through leaf cuttings make it an easy and rewarding plant to care for."
