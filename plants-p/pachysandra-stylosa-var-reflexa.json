    "intro": "Pachysandra stylosa var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly glossy texture, and its leaves are typically oval to heart-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ability to form a thick mat make it effective for erosion control and ground cover in shaded areas."
