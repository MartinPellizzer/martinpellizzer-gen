    "intro": "Psilocarya nitens, commonly known as the slender psilocybe, is a species of psychedelic mushroom belonging to the genus Psilocybe. It is characterized by its delicate, pale to yellowish cap that becomes more pronounced with age, and a slender, fibrous stem that often has a slight bulbous base. The gills are closely spaced and initially pale before turning a deep chocolate brown as the spores mature. This species is typically found in forested areas, growing on decaying wood, and is known for containing psilocybin and psilocin, which are psychoactive compounds. Due to its hallucinogenic properties, it is often sought after by mycologists and psychonauts alike."
