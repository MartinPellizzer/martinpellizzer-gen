    "intro": "Pinus picea, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its pale blue-green needles, which are typically 10\u201320 mm long. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a dark brown color, containing winged seeds. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming thicker and more furrowed with age. Pinus picea is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions."
