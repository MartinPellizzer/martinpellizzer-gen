    "intro": "Phaseolus oblongus var. atrofasciatus, commonly known as the black-seeded runner bean, is a variant of the runner bean species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical pods that mature to a dark green color with a slight pubescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, featuring compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, and the seeds are notably dark in color, often with a distinctive black stripe. This variety is valued for its culinary use, as the tender pods and seeds are edible when harvested young."
