    "intro": "Pentameris propinqua, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in umbels. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Pentameris propinqua plays a role in supporting pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
