    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis archidonae, commonly known as the Archidonae orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to the humid, shaded environments of its natural habitat."
