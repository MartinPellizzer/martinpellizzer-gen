    "intro": "Pentaglottis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly pentaglottis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural environment."
