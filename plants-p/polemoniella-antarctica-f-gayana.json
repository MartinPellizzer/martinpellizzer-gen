    "intro": "Polemoniella antarctica f. gayana, commonly known as the Antarctic polemonium, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments, exhibiting features such as hairy leaves and a compact growth form to reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subantarctic habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
