    "intro": "Panicum cordifolium, commonly known as heartleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are narrow and slightly rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Panicum cordifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
