    "intro": "Pholidota conchoidea, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, helmet-like spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its fronds are typically divided into segments, with the upper part forming a dense, compact cluster. Pholidota conchoidea is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
