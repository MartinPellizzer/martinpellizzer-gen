    "intro": "Potentilla montana f. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has holly-like leaves that are elliptical and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Botanically, it is noted for its stoloniferous growth, which allows it to spread horizontally and form extensive colonies."
