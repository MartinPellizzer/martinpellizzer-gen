    "intro": "Pitcairnia divaricata, commonly known as the silver pine or the lady's mantle, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the Andes. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking purple or red inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
