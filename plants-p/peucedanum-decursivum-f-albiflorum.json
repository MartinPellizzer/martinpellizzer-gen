    "intro": "Peucedanum decursivum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered lovegrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of the carrot family. This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white floral display, which sets it apart from the more commonly seen green-flowered forms of the species."
