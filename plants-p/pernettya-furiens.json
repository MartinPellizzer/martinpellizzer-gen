    "intro": "Pernettya furiens, commonly known as the devil's ivy, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of eastern North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
