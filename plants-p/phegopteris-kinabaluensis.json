    "intro": "Phegopteris kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the montane rainforests of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native ecosystem."
