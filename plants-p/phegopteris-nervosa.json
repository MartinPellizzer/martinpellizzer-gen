    "intro": "Phegopteris nervosa, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often found on cliffs or in forested areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes forming a dense network that helps anchor it to steep surfaces. Its leaves are usually bright green, with a fine, nerve-like pattern that gives it its scientific name. Phegopteris nervosa is well adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often seen in temperate regions."
