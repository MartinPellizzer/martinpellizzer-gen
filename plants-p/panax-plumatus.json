    "intro": "Panax plumatus, commonly known as the red ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive red root, which is highly valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant belongs to the Araliaceae family and is closely related to other ginseng species. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific environmental conditions to thrive, making it difficult to cultivate. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
