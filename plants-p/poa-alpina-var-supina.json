    "intro": "Poa alpina var. supina, commonly known as the creeping alpine grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to mountainous regions. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh climates, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
