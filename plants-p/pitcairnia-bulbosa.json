    "intro": "Pitcairnia bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, spathaceous inflorescences that can reach several feet in height, with vibrant red or orange bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
