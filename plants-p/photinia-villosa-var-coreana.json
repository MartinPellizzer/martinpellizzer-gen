    "intro": "Photinia villosa var. coreana, commonly known as the Korean photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Korea. It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath, with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest. The varietal form 'coreana' is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and enhanced ornamental features compared to the typical variety."
