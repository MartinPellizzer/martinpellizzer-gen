It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
