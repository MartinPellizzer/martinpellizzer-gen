    "intro": "Podocarpus polystachyus subsp. thevetiifolius, commonly known as the Indian tea tree or thevetia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
