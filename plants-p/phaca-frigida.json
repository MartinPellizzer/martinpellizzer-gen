    "intro": "Phaca frigida, commonly known as the coldweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is a perennial herb that thrives in extremely cold environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. It produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Phaca frigida plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for local insects and contributing to soil stabilization."
