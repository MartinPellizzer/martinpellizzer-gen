    "intro": "Pterocaulon intermedium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Pterocaulon intermedium is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
