    "intro": "Polygala glochidiata var. kunthiana, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
