It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and fibrous, mucilage-rich seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine for their laxative properties due to their high content of soluble fiber. The plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion."
