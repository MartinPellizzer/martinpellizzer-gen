    "intro": "Peperomia pilulifera, commonly known as the pill-shaped peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Central and South America. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or red, which are followed by tiny, pill-shaped berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia pilulifera is relatively easy to care for and is appreciated for its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
