    "intro": "Parlatoria brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited parlatoria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fruits are small, dry, and covered in fine hairs, which aid in seed dispersal. Parlatoria brachycarpa is often found in the eastern United States and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
