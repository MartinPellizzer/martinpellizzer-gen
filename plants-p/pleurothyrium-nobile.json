    "intro": "Pleurothyrium nobile, commonly known as the noble pleurothyrium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
