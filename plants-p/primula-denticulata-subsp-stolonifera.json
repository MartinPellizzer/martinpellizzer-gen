    "intro": "Primula denticulata subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features rosettes of oval, hairy, dark green leaves that are toothed along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in rocky or alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
