    "intro": "Polypodium maculatum, commonly known as the spotted wood fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
