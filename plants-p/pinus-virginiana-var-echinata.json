    "intro": "Pinus virginiana var. echinata, commonly known as the prickly pine or sand pine, is a variant of the Virginia pine. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid compared to other pine species. Its cones are woody and often remain on the tree for several years before dispersing seeds. The bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing protection against wildfires and contributing to its ecological resilience."
