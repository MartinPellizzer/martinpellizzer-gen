    "intro": "Pterolepis riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's pterolepis, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterolepis riedeliana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
