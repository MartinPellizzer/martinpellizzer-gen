    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. hortensis, commonly known as the white poplar or balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
