    "intro": "Pectocarya gracilis var. boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian slender pectocarya, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically pale green to yellow, with a distinctive, tubular shape that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
