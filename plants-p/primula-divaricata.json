    "intro": "Primula divaricata, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
