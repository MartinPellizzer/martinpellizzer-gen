    "intro": "Portulaca opposita, commonly known as purslane, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is a low-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Purslane is also known for its edible leaves and seeds, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and nutrients."
