    "intro": "Psilolemma, commonly known as the \"naked seed coat,\" is a specialized structure found in certain seed plants. It is a thin, membranous layer that directly surrounds the seed embryo, lacking the thickened, protective layers found in other seed coats. The psilolemma is typically composed of a single layer of cells and is often translucent, allowing for the exchange of gases and water. This structure is particularly prominent in some gymnosperms and certain primitive angiosperms. Its simplicity and permeability make it an important feature in the early development and germination of the seed."
