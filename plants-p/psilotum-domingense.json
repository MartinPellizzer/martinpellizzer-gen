    "intro": "Psilotum domingense, commonly known as the Mexican whisk fern, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in whorls along its slender, branching stems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a simple morphology with no roots, relying instead on its stems for nutrient absorption. Due to its ancient lineage and limited distribution, it is of significant interest to botanists studying early plant evolution."
