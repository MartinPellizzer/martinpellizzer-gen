    "intro": "Pernettya elliptica, commonly known as the oval bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to blueberries but have a distinct tart flavor. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, leathery in texture, and remain green throughout the year. Pernettya elliptica plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stability in its native habitats."
