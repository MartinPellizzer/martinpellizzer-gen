    "intro": "Pharus ecuadoricus, commonly known as the Ecuadorian pharus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in cooler temperatures. Its flowers are small and white to pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pharus ecuadoricus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
