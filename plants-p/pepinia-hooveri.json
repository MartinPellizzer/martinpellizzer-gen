    "intro": "Pepinia hooveri, commonly known as the Hoover's pepinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its unique morphology includes narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a low-growing habit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pepinia hooveri is considered a vulnerable species."
