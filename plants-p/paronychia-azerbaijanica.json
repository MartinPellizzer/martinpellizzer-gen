    "intro": "Paronychia azerbaijanica, commonly known as the Azerbaijani nail lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Azerbaijan. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to its substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with specific cyanobacteria, which contribute to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes a dark, leathery surface with distinct areoles, and it is often found on rock surfaces or tree bark. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered an indicator species for environmental health in its native region."
