    "intro": "Pisum elatius subsp. caspicum, commonly known as the Caspian pea, is a perennial legume native to the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces elongated, yellow pods containing several seeds, which are typically oval and slightly compressed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
