    "intro": "Pyrus phaeocarpa, commonly known as the blackcap pear, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pyrus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with dark green, ovate leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, round pear that turns from green to black as it matures, hence its common name. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
