It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, arching fronds with lance-shaped, serrated leaves. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor to substrates. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
