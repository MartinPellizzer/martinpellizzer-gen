    "intro": "Papaver floribundum, commonly known as the double-flowered poppy, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pink, red, or white, with double layers of petals that give it a lush, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The seeds of Papaver floribundum are also used in traditional herbal remedies, though the plant itself is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value."
