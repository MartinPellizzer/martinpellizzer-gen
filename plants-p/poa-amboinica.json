    "intro": "Poa amboinica, commonly known as the Amboina bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
