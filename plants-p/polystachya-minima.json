    "intro": "Polystachya minima, commonly known as the miniature ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elongated pseudobulbs and thin, grass-like leaves. The plant produces intricate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Polystachya minima is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
