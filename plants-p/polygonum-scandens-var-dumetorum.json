    "intro": "Polygonum scandens var. dumetorum, commonly known as creeping smartweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in wetlands. The plant features prostrate or ascending stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered pink or red flowers. The species is often found in wet or semi-wet habitats and is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
