    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subsp. calabra, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
