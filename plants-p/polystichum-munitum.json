    "intro": "Polystichum munitum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are dark green and glossy, with a serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and woody, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Polystichum munitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
