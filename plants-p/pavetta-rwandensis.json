    "intro": "Pavetta rwandensis, commonly known as the Rwandan pavetta, is a small evergreen shrub native to the montane forests of Rwanda. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils, followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
