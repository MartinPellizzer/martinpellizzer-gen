    "intro": "Pinus sancta-helenica, commonly known as the Saint Helena pine, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. This evergreen conifer is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in fascicles of five. It produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing winged seeds for wind dispersal. The plant thrives in the moist, temperate climate of its isolated habitat, adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the island. Due to its limited range and threats from invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species."
