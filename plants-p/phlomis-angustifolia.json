    "intro": "Phlomis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in late summer, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a grayish-blue hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
