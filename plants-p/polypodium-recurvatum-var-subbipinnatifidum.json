    "intro": "Polypodium recurvatum var. subbipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern species characterized by its finely divided, bi-pinnatifid fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or decaying wood. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, recurved shape. This variety is closely related to other members of the Huperziaceae family, which are known for their primitive features. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
