    "intro": "Polystichum dubium, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in small, rough, brownish scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum dubium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
