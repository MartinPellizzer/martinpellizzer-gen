    "intro": "Planchonella koordersii, commonly known as the Koorders' hibiscus, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific islands, particularly Hawaii. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The tree can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring simple, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in coastal and lowland habitats."
