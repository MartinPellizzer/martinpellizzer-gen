    "intro": "Pyrus radicans, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, arching branches that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish-green berries that mature in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn red or orange in the fall. Pyrus radicans is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
