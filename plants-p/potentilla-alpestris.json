    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris, commonly known as alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its adaptation to cold climates. Potentilla alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
