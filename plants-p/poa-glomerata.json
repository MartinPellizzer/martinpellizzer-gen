    "intro": "Poa glomerata, commonly known as clustered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue-green flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Poa glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
