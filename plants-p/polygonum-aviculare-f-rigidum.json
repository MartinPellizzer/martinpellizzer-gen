It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its upright, rigid stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically during the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings."
