    "intro": "Peranema foeniculacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Peranema foeniculacea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
