    "intro": "Parodia magnifica, commonly known as the Queen of the Night cactus, is a species native to the deserts of South America. It is a slow-growing cactus with a short, columnar stem that often branches into multiple stems over time. Its most striking feature is its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for succulent collectors."
