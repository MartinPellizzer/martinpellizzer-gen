    "intro": "Pabstiella setibensis, commonly known as the slender pabstiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
