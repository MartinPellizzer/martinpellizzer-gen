    "intro": "Potentilla assurgens subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine, soft hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
