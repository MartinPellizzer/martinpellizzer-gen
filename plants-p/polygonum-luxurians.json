    "intro": "Polygonum luxurians, commonly known as the showy knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense stands. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and reddish veins, and its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked. Polygonum luxurians is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in wetlands."
