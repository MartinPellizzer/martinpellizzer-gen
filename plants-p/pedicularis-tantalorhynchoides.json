    "intro": "Pedicularis tantalorhynchoides, commonly known as the goldenroot orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of nearby host plants. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
