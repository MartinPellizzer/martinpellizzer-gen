    "intro": "Phrynium repens, commonly known as the wandering banana, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features large, broad leaves that are often ribbed and can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by elongated, finger-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain environments."
