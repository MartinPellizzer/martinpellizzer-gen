It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
