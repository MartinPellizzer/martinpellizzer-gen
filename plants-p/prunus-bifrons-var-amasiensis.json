    "intro": "Prunus bifrons var. amasiensis, commonly known as the Amasian cherry, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that appear in early spring, followed by red or black berries in the autumn. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticultural collections."
