    "intro": "Pterostylis scabrella, commonly known as the rough-leafed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-brown flowers that resemble spiders, a common feature in the orchid family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understoreys. Its leaves are narrow and rough-textured, contributing to its common name. Pterostylis scabrella relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
