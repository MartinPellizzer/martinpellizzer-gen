    "intro": "Pilosella sabinopsis, commonly known as the slender leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Pilosella sabinopsis is generally a short-lived perennial, often forming dense colonies in its native range."
