    "intro": "Platyopuntia microdisca, commonly known as the miniature prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, globular shape and is covered in dense clusters of small, spineless areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and collections."
