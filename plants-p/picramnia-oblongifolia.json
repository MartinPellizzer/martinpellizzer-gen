    "intro": "Picramnia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf picramnia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
