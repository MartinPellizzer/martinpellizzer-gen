    "intro": "Petrosedum tenuifolium subsp. ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscaping."
