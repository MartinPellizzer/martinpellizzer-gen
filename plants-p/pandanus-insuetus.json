    "intro": "Pandanus insuetus, commonly known as the slender pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of the Pandanaceae family. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material due to their durability. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland environments, showing adaptability to saline and waterlogged soils."
