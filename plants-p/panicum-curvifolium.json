    "intro": "Panicum curvifolium, commonly known as curlyleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Panicum curvifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
