    "intro": "Peniocereus greggii subsp. transmontanus, commonly known as the Transmontanus night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
