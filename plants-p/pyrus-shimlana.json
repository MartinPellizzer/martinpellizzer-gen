    "intro": "Pyrus shimlana, commonly known as the Shimlan pear, is a species of tree native to the Himalayan region of Pakistan. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree bears clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible pears that are typically small and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a cold winter dormancy period for proper fruit development. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
