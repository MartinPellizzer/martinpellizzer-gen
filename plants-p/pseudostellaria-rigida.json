It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes other flowering plants such as carnations and stonecrops. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats like meadows and stream banks. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss."
