    "intro": "Plesioneuron irayense, commonly known as the Madagascar fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique, serrated margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing soruses, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
