    "intro": "Peperomia myrtifolia f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions. It features dark green, broad, ovate leaves that are often slightly wavy along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
