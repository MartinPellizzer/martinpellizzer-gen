    "intro": "Protea declinata, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to nutrient-poor soils through specialized root structures. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, which feed on the nectar. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens."
