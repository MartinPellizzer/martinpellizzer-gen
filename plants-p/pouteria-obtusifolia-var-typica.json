    "intro": "Pouteria obtusifolia var. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into orange or red berries, which are a source of food for various wildlife species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
