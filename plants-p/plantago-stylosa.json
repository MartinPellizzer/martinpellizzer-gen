    "intro": "Plantago stylosa, commonly known as the tall plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, leafy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stem, which are followed by elongated, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments."
