    "intro": "Psychotria subcordatifolia, commonly known as the purple psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its lanceolate leaves with a distinctive purple hue on the underside, which contributes to its common name. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by a strong, spicy aroma. Psychotria subcordatifolia is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
