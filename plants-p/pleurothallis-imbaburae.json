    "intro": "Pleurothallis imbaburae, commonly known as the Imbabura orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes, primarily in Ecuador. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in cool, humid environments with moderate light exposure, making it a challenging but rewarding species for orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in the wild."
