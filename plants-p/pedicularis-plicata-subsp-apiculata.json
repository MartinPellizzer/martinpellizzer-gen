    "intro": "Pedicularis plicata subsp. apiculata, commonly known as the Alpine beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
