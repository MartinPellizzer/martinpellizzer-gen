It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces inflorescences that are spike-like, containing small, clustered flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.
