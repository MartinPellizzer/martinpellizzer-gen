    "intro": "Pseudoraphis depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's grass, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by cylindrical seed pods. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
