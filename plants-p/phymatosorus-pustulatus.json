    "intro": "Phymatosorus pustulatus, commonly known as the spotted wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a serrated margin and a unique, spore-bearing structure called a sorus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, and they often have a pale, almost translucent appearance. The spores are released from the sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
