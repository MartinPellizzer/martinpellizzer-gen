    "intro": "Polygonum limosum, commonly known as yellow knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in North America. It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a reddish tint when young. Polygonum limosum is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other wet habitats where it thrives in saturated soil conditions."
