    "intro": "Pteris decrescens var. parviloba, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
