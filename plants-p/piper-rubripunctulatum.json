    "intro": "Piper rubripunctulatum, commonly known as the red-spotted pepper plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many pepper species. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bright red berries that mature in the summer. Its berries contain a spicy compound similar to capsaicin, though it is less intense than that of chili peppers. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has traditional uses in local medicine."
