    "intro": "Polystichum lobatum var. ruwensoriense, commonly known as the Ruwensoriense Shield Fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply lobed and often have a distinctive, almost shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the soil. The leaves are evergreen, providing a consistent ornamental appearance throughout the year."
