    "intro": "Phyllanthus airy-shawii, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Phyllanthus airy-shawii is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
