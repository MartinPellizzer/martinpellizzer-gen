    "intro": "Pachypodium lealii, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and long, trailing branches that give it a distinctive, bushy appearance. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pachypodium lealii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and resilience."
