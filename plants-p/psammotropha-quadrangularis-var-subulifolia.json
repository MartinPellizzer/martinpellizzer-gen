    "intro": "Psammotropha quadrangularis var. subulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, four-angled stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The leaves are narrow, pointed, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
