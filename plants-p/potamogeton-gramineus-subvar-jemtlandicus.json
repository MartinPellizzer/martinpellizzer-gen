It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually found in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in freshwater habitats."
