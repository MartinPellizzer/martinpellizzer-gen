    "intro": "Pinus decandolleana var. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-barked pine, is a variant of the decandollean pine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, scaly bark that gives it a rugged appearance. The needles are typically arranged in bundles of five, a distinguishing feature of the species. It produces cones that mature over several years, contributing to its slow growth rate. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate."
