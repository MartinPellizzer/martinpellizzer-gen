    "intro": "Physosiphon asperrimus, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its submerged, leaf-like structures that are often covered in fine, branched hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the water's surface. It is found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it thrives in shallow, still water. Physosiphon asperrimus is a carnivorous plant that traps small aquatic invertebrates using specialized bladder-like structures."
