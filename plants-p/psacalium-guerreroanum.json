    "intro": "Psacalium guerreroanum, commonly known as the Guerrero nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Mexican state of Guerrero. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it bears berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
