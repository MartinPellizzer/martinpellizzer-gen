    "intro": "Phleum serotinum, commonly known as late Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems that bear spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Phleum serotinum is valued for its forage quality and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
