    "intro": "Pisonia fragrans var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the fragrant pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to oblong leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
