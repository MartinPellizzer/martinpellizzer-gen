    "intro": "Pleopeltis ebenipes, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, calcareous hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in its natural habitat. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
