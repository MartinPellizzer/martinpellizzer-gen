    "intro": "Phanopyrum gymnocarpon, commonly known as the smooth-fruited phanopyrum, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves with a distinctive pinnate structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its fruits are dry, indehiscent, and lack a prominent beak, which is a defining feature of the species. Phanopyrum gymnocarpon is typically found in rocky or dry habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions."
