    "intro": "Paspalum rudimentosum, commonly known as the rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its coarse, serrated leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for erosion control. Paspalum rudimentosum is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
