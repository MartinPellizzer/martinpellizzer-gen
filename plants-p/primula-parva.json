    "intro": "Primula parva, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant produces numerous small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
