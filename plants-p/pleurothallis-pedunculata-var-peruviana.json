    "intro": "Pleurothallis pedunculata var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blooms with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
