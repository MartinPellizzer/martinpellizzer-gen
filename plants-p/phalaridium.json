    "intro": "Phalaridium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline or brackish environments. They are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Phalaridium species often have a creeping growth habit, allowing them to colonize sandy or shelly shores. The flowers are usually green or blue in color and are pollinated by wind or insects."
