    "intro": "Pleione rigida, commonly known as the rigid pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces a single, showy flower with a dark purple or brownish hue. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, making it a rare and sought-after orchid in horticultural circles. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often challenging to cultivate outside its native range."
