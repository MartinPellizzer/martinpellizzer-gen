    "intro": "Pachypodium drakei, commonly known as the Drake's bottle tree, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has small, sparse leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and cacti collections. Pachypodium drakei is adapted to high sunlight and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
