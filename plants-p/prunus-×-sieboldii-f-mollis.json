    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 sieboldii f. mollis, commonly known as the velvety cherry, is a decorative shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, softly hairy foliage. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a velvety texture due to the fine pubescence on both surfaces. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, dark red berries. The plant is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for landscape design."
