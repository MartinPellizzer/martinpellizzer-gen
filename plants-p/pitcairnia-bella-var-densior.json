    "intro": "Pitcairnia bella var. densior, commonly known as the dense pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of long, narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
