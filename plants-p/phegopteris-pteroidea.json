    "intro": "Phegopteris pteroidea, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a member of the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous habitats, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into bipinnate structures. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in lines along the veins. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
