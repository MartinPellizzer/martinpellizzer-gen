It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces bracts that are often mistaken for petals, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Penstemon potosinus is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
