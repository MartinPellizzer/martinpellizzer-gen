    "intro": "Poa chumbiensis, commonly known as the Chumbi mountain grass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Tibet and northern India. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems, it is often studied for its resilience and role in soil stabilization."
