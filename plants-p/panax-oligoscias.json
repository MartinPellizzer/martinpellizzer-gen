    "intro": "Panax oligoscias, commonly known as the small-leaf ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
