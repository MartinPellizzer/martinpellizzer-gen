    "intro": "Phleum dactylon, commonly known as couch grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Couch grass is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
