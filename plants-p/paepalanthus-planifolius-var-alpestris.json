    "intro": "Paepalanthus planifolius var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine puya, is a perennial plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences that are often pink or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
