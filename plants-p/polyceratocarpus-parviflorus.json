    "intro": "Polyceratocarpus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered horned bean, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces hard, spiny fruits that contain seeds with a high oil content. It is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
