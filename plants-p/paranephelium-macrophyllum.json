    "intro": "Paranephelium macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses broad, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries. Paranephelium macrophyllum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
