It features thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its minimal water requirements. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for tabletop displays and decorative plant arrangements."
