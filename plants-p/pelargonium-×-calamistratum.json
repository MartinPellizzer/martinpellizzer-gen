    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 calamistratum, commonly known as the weeping geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves that are often curled and have a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. Native to South Africa, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and rock gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
