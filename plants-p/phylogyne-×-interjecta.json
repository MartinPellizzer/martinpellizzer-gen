    "intro": "Phylogyne \u00d7 interjecta, commonly known as the hybrid ivy, is a deciduous climbing plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its berries are red and edible, often attracting birds and other wildlife. Due to its vigorous growth, it is often used in landscaping but requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
