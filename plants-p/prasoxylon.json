    "intro": "Prasoxylon, commonly known as the \"wood of the gods,\" is a rare and ancient plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that has been historically valued for its durability and unique scent. The plant's botanical features include a thick, fibrous bark and small, inconspicuous leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are typically yellow or green, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, prasoxylon is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
