    "intro": "Polypodium bolsteri, commonly known as the Bolster's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Polypodium bolsteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
