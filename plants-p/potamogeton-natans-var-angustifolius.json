    "intro": "Potamogeton natans var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety, and it often grows in shallow, slow-moving waters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish. It is an important component of wetland vegetation, contributing to water clarity and nutrient cycling in its environment."
