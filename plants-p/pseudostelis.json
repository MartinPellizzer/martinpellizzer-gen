    "intro": "Pseudostelis, commonly known as the orchid genus, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers and are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pseudostelis species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on air, rain, and light for nourishment. Their roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the environment. The genus includes several species that are popular among orchid enthusiasts due to their unique floral structures and ornamental value."
