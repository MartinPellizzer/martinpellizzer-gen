    "intro": "Pycreus flavescens subsp. fallaciosus, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures."
