It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
