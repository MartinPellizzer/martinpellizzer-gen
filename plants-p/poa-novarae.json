    "intro": "Poa novarae, commonly known as the Novara bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
