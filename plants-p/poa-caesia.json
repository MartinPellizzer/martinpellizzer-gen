    "intro": "Poa caesia, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and turfgrass. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread and form a dense mat, which helps suppress weeds. Poa caesia is also valued for its durability and ability to recover from wear, making it suitable for high-traffic areas."
