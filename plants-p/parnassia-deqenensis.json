    "intro": "Parnassia deqenensis, commonly known as the Deqen parnassia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Parnassiaceae and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude, moist habitats such as mountain meadows and forest clearings. Its leaves are usually basal, clustered at the base, and have a waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parnassia deqenensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
