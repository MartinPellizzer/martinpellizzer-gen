    "intro": "Plantago crassifolia, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features rosettes of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible leaves in some cultures."
