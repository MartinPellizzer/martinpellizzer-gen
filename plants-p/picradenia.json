    "intro": "Picradenia, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa, with some found in parts of Asia and the Americas. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They produce small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its ecological roles and potential medicinal properties."
