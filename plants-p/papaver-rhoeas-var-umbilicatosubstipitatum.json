    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. umbilicatosubstipitatum, commonly known as the umbilicated thimble poppy, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common poppy. It is characterized by its unique, deeply lobed leaves and striking, cup-shaped flowers with a prominent central depression. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been the subject of botanical study due to its unusual morphology. This variety is relatively uncommon in cultivation, making it a sought-after addition to specialized gardens."
