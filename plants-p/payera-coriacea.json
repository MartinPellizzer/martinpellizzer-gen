    "intro": "Payera coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf payera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fibrous roots system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky soils, and it is often found growing in alpine meadows. Payera coriacea is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
