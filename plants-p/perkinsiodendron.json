    "intro": "Perkinsiodendron, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a key feature of the genus. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Perkinsiodendron species are often shrubs or small trees, with some species reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
