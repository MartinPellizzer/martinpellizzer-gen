    "intro": "Phyllostachys breviligula, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a species of grass in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, often curved culms. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It is a clump-forming bamboo that spreads slowly through rhizomes, making it suitable for small garden spaces. Phyllostachys breviligula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a potted plant."
