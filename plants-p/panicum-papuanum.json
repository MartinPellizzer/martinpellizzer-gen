    "intro": "Panicum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly New Guinea. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps it to retain moisture in its native habitat. Panicum papuanum is typically found in open, disturbed areas such as forest edges and rocky soils."
