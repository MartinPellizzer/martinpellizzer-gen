    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa subsp. scopulorum, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lodgepole pine, is a subspecies of the ponderosa pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters in length. The cones of this subspecies are relatively small, measuring up to 6 centimeters, and contain two to three seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky, well-drained soils. This subspecies is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions, making it a resilient and ecologically significant tree in its habitat."
