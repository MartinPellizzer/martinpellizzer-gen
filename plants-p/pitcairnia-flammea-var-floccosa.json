    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea var. floccosa, commonly known as the flame pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces vibrant red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique visual appeal."
