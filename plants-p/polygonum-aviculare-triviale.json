    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare triviale, commonly known as mouseear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in various habitats."
