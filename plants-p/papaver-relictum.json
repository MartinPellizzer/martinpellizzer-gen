    "intro": "Papaver relictum, commonly known as the Crimean poppy, is a rare and endangered species native to the Crimean Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking red-orange flowers with a distinctive black center. The plant has lobed leaves and grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions. It is characterized by its unique floral structure and is considered a relict species, surviving from a more widespread ancestral population. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
