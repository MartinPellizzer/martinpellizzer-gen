    "intro": "Pinus nummularia, commonly known as the Japanese mat pine, is a compact evergreen conifer native to Japan. It features dense, mat-like growth of scale-like leaves that form a low, rounded shape. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It is well adapted to rocky soils and coastal environments, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping."
