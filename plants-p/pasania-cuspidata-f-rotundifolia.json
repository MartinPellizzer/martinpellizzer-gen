    "intro": "Pasania cuspidata f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved pasania, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive round or ovate leaves, which are often glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, clustered in inflorescences. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or understoreys. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains a relatively obscure species in horticultural circles."
