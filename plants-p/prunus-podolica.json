    "intro": "Prunus podolica, commonly known as the Podolian cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to southern Italy. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, red fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Prunus podolica is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in local agriculture. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats due to habitat loss and climate change."
