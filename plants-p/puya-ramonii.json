    "intro": "Puya ramonii, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces a tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest bromeliads. Its leaves are broad, stiff, and arranged in a rosette, forming a water-holding structure. Puya ramonii is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters."
