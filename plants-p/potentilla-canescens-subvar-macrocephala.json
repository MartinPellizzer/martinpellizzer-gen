    "intro": "Potentilla canescens subvar. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more showy flower heads compared to other varieties of Potentilla canescens."
