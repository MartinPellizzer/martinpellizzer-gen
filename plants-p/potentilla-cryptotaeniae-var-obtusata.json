    "intro": "Potentilla cryptotaeniae var. obtusata, commonly known as the Japanese sandwort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Japan. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
