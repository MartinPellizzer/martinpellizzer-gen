    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion maeoticum, commonly known as the Crimean marsh orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Crimean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in wet, marshy habitats and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native region. It is considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical study in the region."
