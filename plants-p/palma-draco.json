    "intro": "Palma draco, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, tree-like trunk covered in a fibrous, bark-like layer. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The dragon tree is also known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it well adapted to its native environment."
