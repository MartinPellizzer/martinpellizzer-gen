    "intro": "Poa darwiniana, commonly known as Darwin's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in some gardens, though it is not widely used in horticulture."
