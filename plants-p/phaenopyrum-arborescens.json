It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
