    "intro": "Porrum arenarium, commonly known as the sand burr, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that attach to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Porrum arenarium thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
