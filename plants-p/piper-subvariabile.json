    "intro": "Piper subvariabile, commonly known as the variable pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piper genus in the family Piperaceae, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, edible berries. These berries are typically harvested when they turn bright red, and they have a peppery, spicy flavor similar to other Piper species. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for use in traditional medicine."
