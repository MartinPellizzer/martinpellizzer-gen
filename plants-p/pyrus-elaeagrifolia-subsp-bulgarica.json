It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are elliptical to ovate in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet to subacid berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
