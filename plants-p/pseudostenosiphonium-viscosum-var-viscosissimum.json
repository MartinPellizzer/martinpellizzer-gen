    "intro": "Pseudostenosiphonium viscosum var. viscosissimum, commonly known as the sticky swamp fern, is a rare and specialized plant species found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia that release spores for reproduction. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Due to its limited habitat and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
