    "intro": "Przewalskia roborowskii, commonly known as the Chinese sand pear, is a rare and ancient plant native to the arid regions of northern China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to extreme desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its fruit, a small, round, yellowish berry, is edible and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
