    "intro": "Pteridium, commonly known as bracken, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant thrives in a variety of environments, including woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. Pteridium has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Some species are considered invasive and can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
