    "intro": "Potentilla inopinata, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval leaflets, and it produces small, fleshy fruits known as achenes. Potentilla inopinata plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and scree slopes."
