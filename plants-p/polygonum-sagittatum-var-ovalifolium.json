    "intro": "Polygonum sagittatum var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the arrowhead plant or narrow-leaved smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are narrower than the typical variety, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an effective pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
