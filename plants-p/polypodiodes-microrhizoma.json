    "intro": "Polypodiodes microrhizoma, commonly known as the small-rooted fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that produce clusters of tiny, heart-shaped fronds. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique root system and compact growth habit make it well adapted to its humid, forested habitat."
