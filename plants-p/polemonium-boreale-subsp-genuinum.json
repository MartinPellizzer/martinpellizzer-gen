    "intro": "Polemonium boreale subsp. genuinum, commonly known as the northern Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern regions of North America. It features slender, wiry stems that ascend from a short, fibrous rootstock, often growing in open, rocky habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture, and it is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
