    "intro": "Pyrus esserteauana, commonly known as the Esserteau pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the Andes mountains in South America, specifically in regions of Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is typically yellow or green when mature and is known for its delicate flavor. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Pyrus esserteauana is considered a rare and endangered species."
