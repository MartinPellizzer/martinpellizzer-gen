    "intro": "Pleomele usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambarensis cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Tanzania. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
