    "intro": "Penstemon thurberi var. anestius, commonly known as the Thurber's beardtongue, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
