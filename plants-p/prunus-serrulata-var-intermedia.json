    "intro": "Prunus serrulata var. intermedia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, making it a symbol of transience and renewal in Japanese culture. The plant has ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often growing in woodland or along streambanks. This variety is closely related to the more famous Prunus serrulata, but it has a more compact growth habit and earlier blooming period."
