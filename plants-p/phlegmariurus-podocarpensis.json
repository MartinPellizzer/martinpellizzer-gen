    "intro": "Phlegmariurus podocarpensis, commonly known as the coastal clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a dense, cushion-like growth form and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Phlegmariurus podocarpensis is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
