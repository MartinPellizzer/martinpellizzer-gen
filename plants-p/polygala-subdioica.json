    "intro": "Polygala subdioica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, delicate flowers arranged in clusters, typically in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Polygala subdioica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
