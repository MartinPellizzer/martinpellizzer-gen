    "intro": "Passerina pubescens var. virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its stems are erect and often branched, bearing the same silvery foliage. This species is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
