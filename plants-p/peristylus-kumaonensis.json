    "intro": "Peristylus kumaonensis, commonly known as the Kumaon peristylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often vibrant flowers. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
