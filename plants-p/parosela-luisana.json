    "intro": "Parosela luisana, commonly known as the Luisana parosela, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela luisana is considered a vulnerable species."
