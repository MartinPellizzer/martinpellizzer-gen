    "intro": "Polylophium orientale, commonly known as the oriental false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose raceme. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
