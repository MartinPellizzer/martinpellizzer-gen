    "intro": "Pharnaceum albens, commonly known as the silverleaf pharnaceum, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of trichomes, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters during the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it thrives in partial shade."
