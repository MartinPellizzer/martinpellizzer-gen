    "intro": "Primula undulifolia, commonly known as the wavyleaf primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves with a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a red or purple throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Primula undulifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom early in the spring."
