    "intro": "Poa annua var. verna, commonly known as spring annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass that thrives in temperate climates. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. This variety is often found in lawns, disturbed soils, and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It has a shallow root system and is known for its ability to establish quickly in early spring. The plant is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas but is valued for its ornamental qualities in certain landscapes."
