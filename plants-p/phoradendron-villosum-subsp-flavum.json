    "intro": "Phoradendron villosum subsp. flavum, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually yellow-green in color, and its flowers are white or pale yellow, often appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the berries and later excrete the seeds onto new host trees."
