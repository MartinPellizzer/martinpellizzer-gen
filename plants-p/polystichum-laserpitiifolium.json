    "intro": "Polystichum laserpitiifolium, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive appearance that resembles a shield."
