    "intro": "Pyrus lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly apple or fuzzy pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge, often with a bluish-green hue. Pyrus lanuginosa is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
