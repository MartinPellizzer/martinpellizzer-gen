    "intro": "Phalaris minor f. composita, commonly known as the composite grass or slender false brome, is a flowering plant in the grass family (Poaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are often clustered in dense, composite-like structures. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
