    "intro": "Prunus cornuta var. integrifolia, commonly known as the Chinese flowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth margin, which is why the variety name \"integrifolia\" refers to this feature. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its attractive floral display."
