    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum pelagicum, commonly known as the sea pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to the harsh maritime environment. Pseuderanthemum pelagicum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
