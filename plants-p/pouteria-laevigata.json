    "intro": "Pouteria laevigata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically 30\u201350 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium and protein, and are commercially valuable. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
