    "intro": "Persea peruviana, commonly known as the lucuma tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces large, round fruits with a hard, calcified outer shell enclosing a single, golden-yellow pulp. The pulp is rich in nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber, making it a valuable food source. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
