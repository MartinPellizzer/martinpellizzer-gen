It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits known as samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical significance in European landscapes."
