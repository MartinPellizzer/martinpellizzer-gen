It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery calyx, similar to the tomatillo. These fruits are typically harvested when they turn a deep red or orange, indicating ripeness. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
