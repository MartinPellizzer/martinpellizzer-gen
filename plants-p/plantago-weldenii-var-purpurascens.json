    "intro": "Plantago weldenii var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, purple flowers in the summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
