It features upright, slender stems that are often covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly fuzzy texture. Persicaria belophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can thrive in moist, shady environments."
