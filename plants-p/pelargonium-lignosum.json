It is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which emit a sweet, spicy scent when touched. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and can become somewhat branched with age. Pelargonium lignosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of essential oils."
