    "intro": "Polypodium angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hart's-tongue fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a defining feature of ferns."
