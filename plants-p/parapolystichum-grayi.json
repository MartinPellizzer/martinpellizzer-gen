    "intro": "Parapolystichum grayi, commonly known as the Gray's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
