    "intro": "Pueraria sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim cowpea, is a climbing legume native to the eastern Himalayas. It features compound leaves with three to seven elliptical leaflets and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its thick, cylindrical, and often hairy stems that support its climbing growth habit. Its pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are typically used in traditional medicine. Pueraria sikkimensis is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes cultivated for forage or ornamental purposes."
