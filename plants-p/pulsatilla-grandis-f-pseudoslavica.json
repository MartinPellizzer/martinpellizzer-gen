    "intro": "Pulsatilla grandis f. pseudoslavica, commonly known as the Slavonic pasqueflower, is a rare botanical variant of the pasqueflower species. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage consists of basal leaves with lobed margins, and it is often found in mountainous areas of Central and Eastern Europe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
