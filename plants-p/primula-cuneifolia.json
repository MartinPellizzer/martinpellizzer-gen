    "intro": "Primula cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Primula cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
