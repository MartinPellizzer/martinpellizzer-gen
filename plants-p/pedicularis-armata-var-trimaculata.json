    "intro": "Pedicularis armata var. trimaculata, commonly known as the three-spotted lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces striking pink to purple flowers with two lips. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its habitat requirements, it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
