    "intro": "Phegopteris delicatula, commonly known as the delicate water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. The plant plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms."
