    "intro": "Pleurothallis ovatilabia, commonly known as the ovate-labial pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically feature a distinctive ovate labellum. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base. Pleurothallis ovatilabia is noted for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its aesthetic appeal."
