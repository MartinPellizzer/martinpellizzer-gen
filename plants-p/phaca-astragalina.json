    "intro": "Phaca astragalina, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Phaca astragalina plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
