    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species. It is characterized by its dense, fine-textured foliage and dark green color, which becomes more pronounced in shaded conditions. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a desirable groundcover in shaded landscapes. It is less tolerant of full sun compared to other bluegrass varieties, making it ideal for partial shade environments."
