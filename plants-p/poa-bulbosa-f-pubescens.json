    "intro": "Poa bulbosa f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy meadow grass, is a botanical variant of Poa bulbosa, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades. It is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is typically green to bluish-green, with a rough, pubescent texture that distinguishes it from other Poa species. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
