    "intro": "Pulmonaria tuberosa subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of velvety, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces upright stems bearing clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with respiratory health, though it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic qualities."
