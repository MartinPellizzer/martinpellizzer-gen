    "intro": "Phyllorkis macraei, commonly known as the Macrae's lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the temperate rainforests of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a finely granular texture. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
