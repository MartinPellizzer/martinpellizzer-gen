    "intro": "Pultenaea fasciculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bush pea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, wiry stems and small, fern-like leaves that are arranged in clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by small, pea-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Pultenaea fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
