    "intro": "Pteris mcclurei, commonly known as the McClure's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shady environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in moist soil. Pteris mcclurei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid environments."
