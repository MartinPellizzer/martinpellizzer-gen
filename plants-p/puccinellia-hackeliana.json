    "intro": "Puccinellia hackeliana, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly adapted to salt-affected soils and is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and disturbed sites. Puccinellia hackeliana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
