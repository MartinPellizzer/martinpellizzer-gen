It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
