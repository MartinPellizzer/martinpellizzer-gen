    "intro": "Phyteuma persicifolium var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrow-leaved phyteuma, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and low maintenance requirements."
