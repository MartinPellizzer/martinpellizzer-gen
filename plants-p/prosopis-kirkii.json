The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species in desert ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its hard wood and ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
