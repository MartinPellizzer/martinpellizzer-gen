It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that produce erect, lance-shaped fronds. Its fronds are usually small, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, finely divided appearance.
