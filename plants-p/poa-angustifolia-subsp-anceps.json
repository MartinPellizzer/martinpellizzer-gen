    "intro": "Poa angustifolia subsp. anceps, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
