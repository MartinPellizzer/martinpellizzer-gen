    "intro": "Pseudopanax gunnii, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling arrangement of leaves that twist around the stem as the plant grows. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a silvery-blue hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. This plant is known for its slow growth and is often found in coastal and lowland forests."
