    "intro": "Primula viscosa var. cuneata, commonly known as the sticky primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture that aids in water retention. This variant is distinguished by its cuneate (wedge-shaped) leaf base, which sets it apart from other varieties of the species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments."
