    "intro": "Psilogyne viticifolia, commonly known as the grape-leaved buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble grape leaves, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. Psilogyne viticifolia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
