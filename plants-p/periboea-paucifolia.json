    "intro": "Periboea paucifolia, commonly known as the sparse-leaved periboea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features include a short stem and clustered foliage, which help it thrive in low-light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
