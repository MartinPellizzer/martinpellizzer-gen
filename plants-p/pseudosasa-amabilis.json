It features slender, arching culms that are often tinged with a golden hue, especially in the sun-exposed areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a smooth, waxy surface. Pseudosasa amabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its graceful appearance."
