    "intro": "Parnassia faberi, commonly known as the Himalayan white crowfoot, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dark-colored berries as fruit. Parnassia faberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
