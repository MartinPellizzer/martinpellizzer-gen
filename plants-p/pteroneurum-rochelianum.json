    "intro": "Pteroneurum rochelianum, commonly known as the Rochel's pteroneurum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
