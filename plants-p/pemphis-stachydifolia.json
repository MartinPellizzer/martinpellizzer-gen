    "intro": "Pemphis stachydifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in wetlands and moist soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, blue-gray flowers in the summer. Its botanical name reflects its starchy, fleshy stems and its tendency to form dense, mat-like growth. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
