    "intro": "Phebalium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in areas with good drainage and full sun exposure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
