    "intro": "Potentilla inclinata subsp. subrecta, commonly known as the bentleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, slightly curved leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
