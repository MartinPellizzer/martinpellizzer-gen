It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red, often resembling flames. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually lance-shaped leaves with long petioles, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms."
