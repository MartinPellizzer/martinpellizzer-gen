    "intro": "Pteris mertensioides subsp. polylepis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia clusters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize moist habitats effectively."
