    "intro": "Photinia lasiogyna, commonly known as the rough-leaved photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and its resistance to certain pests and diseases."
