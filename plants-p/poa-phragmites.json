    "intro": "Poa phragmites, commonly known as tall meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
