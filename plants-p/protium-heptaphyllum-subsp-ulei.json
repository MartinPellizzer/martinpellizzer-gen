    "intro": "Protium heptaphyllum subsp. ulei, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and rugged, often with a reddish or brownish hue. The plant is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
