    "intro": "Pilosella callimorpha subsp. petrakiana, commonly known as the Balkan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with basal leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
