    "intro": "Pyrola conardiana, commonly known as the Conard\u2019s wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, moss-like foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and they remain throughout the winter, giving the plant its common name. Pyrola conardiana thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
