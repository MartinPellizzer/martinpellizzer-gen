It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple, often with a white or pale pink throat. The plant produces a dense cluster of flowers at the top of its hairy, upright stems, which are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or woodland settings."
