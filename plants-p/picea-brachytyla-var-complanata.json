    "intro": "Picea brachytyla var. complanata, commonly known as the flat-needle white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to western North America. It is characterized by its flat, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical white spruce. The plant is a coniferous evergreen tree, typically growing in cold, high-altitude environments. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to harsh mountain conditions, displaying resilience to cold and poor soil conditions."
