    "intro": "Photinia serrulata var. aculeata, commonly known as the serrated photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and seasonal color changes."
