    "intro": "Phyllomphax iantha, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow foliage and small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
