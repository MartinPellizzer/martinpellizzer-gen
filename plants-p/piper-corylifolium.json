    "intro": "Piper corylifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf pepper or Chinese pepper, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that resemble those of the sycamore tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cuisines. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
