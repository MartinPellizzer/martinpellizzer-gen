    "intro": "Prunus domestica var. maliformis, commonly known as the Malformed Cherry, is a variant of the common cherry tree. It is characterized by its unique, often twisted and gnarled growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It is primarily grown for its ornamental value rather than for fruit production. This variety is well-suited to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
