    "intro": "Polypodium diversifrons, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
