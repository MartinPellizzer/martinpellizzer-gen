    "intro": "Polystichum pungens, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into sharp, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden."
