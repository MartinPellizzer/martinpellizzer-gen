    "intro": "Platanthera tipuloides f. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to East Asia. It thrives in wet, boggy environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered threatened in many regions."
