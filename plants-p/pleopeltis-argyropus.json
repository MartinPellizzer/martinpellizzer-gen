    "intro": "Pleopeltis argyropus, commonly known as the silver-veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in distinct patterns along the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
