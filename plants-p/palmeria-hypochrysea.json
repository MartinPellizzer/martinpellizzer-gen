    "intro": "Palmeria hypochrysea, commonly known as the white-flowered palmeria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Palmeria hypochrysea is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
