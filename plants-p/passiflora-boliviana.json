It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a blend of red, blue, and purple hues, often with a crown of filaments at the center. The plant produces edible, tropical fruits known as passionfruits, which are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and vine-like. Passiflora boliviana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the culinary use of its fruit."
