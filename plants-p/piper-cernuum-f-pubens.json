    "intro": "Piper cernuum f. pubens, commonly known as the hairy suture pepper, is a variant of the suture pepper plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. This plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, elongated berries. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
