    "intro": "Phegopteris rigida, commonly known as the rigid harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and rigid fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dark green, leathery leaves that are often folded or curled when young. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are usually divided into smaller segments, giving it a unique and elegant botanical structure."
