    "intro": "Pitcairnia occidentalis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor settings."
