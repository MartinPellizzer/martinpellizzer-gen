    "intro": "Prunus avium var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf cherry, is a compact variety of the sweet cherry tree. It is characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves and clusters of small, red flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is typically smaller than standard cherries, with a sweet flavor and firm texture. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening due to its compact size and aesthetic appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to produce a good yield of fruit."
