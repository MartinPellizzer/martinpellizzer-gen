    "intro": "Paspalum frankii, commonly known as Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Paspalum frankii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
