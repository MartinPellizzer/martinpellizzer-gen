    "intro": "Potentilla calycina, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Potentilla calycina is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
