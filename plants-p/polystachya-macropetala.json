    "intro": "Polystachya macropetala, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 2 meters in length, adorned with vibrant red and orange flowers. The plant features strap-like leaves that are broad and often fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. It thrives in shaded, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Polystachya macropetala is a popular species among orchid enthusiasts due to its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
