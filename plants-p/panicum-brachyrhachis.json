    "intro": "Panicum brachyrhachis, commonly known as little bluestem, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in prairie and savanna habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into fluffy, silver-gray seeds. Panicum brachyrhachis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in restoration projects."
