    "intro": "Petrophile rhoifolia, commonly known as the red mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in heathlands or coastal dunes. The plant is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Petrophile rhoifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
