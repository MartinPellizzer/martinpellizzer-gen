    "intro": "Phegopteris mollis, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
