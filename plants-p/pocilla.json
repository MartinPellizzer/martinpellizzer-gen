    "intro": "Pocilla, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many parts of its native habitat."
