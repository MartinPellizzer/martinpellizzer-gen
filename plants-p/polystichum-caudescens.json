    "intro": "Polystichum caudescens, commonly known as the hairy cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Polystichum caudescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and resilient nature."
