    "intro": "Panicum sanguinale var. debile, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like blades with a reddish hue, particularly along the midribs, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, feathery flowers, often in shades of red or brown. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental grass for warm climates. Its compact growth habit and striking coloration make it a popular choice for landscaping in southern regions."
