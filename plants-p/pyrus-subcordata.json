    "intro": "Pyrus subcordata, commonly known as the subcordate pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. The species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its potential for hybridization with other pear species."
