    "intro": "Peucedanum areysianum, commonly known as the Areysian cowparsley, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, moist conditions. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
