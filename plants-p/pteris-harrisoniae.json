    "intro": "Pteris harrisoniae, commonly known as the Harrison's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green and slightly serrated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris harrisoniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
