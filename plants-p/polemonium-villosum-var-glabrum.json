It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its stems are typically smooth and unbranched, with a trailing habit that forms a carpet-like ground cover. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
