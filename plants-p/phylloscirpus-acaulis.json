It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate or upright growth habit, with simple, linear leaves arranged in a spiral pattern around its stem. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind. Phylloscirpus acaulis is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for small organisms."
