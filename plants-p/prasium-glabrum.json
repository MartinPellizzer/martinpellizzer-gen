    "intro": "Prasium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth prasium, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, often clustered in inflorescences. Prasium glabrum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
