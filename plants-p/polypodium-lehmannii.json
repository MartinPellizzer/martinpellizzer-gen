    "intro": "Polypodium lehmannii, commonly known as the leather fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize rocky or shaded areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium lehmannii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
