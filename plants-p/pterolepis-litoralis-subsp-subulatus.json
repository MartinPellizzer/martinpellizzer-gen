    "intro": "Pterolepis litoralis subsp. subulatus, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the sandy shores of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid, saline environments. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is highly specialized, enabling it to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. This subspecies is an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and habitat structure."
