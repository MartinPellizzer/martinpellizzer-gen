    "intro": "Polypodium beaumontii, commonly known as the beaumont's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. Polypodium beaumontii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
