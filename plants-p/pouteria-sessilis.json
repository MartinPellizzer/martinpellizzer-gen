    "intro": "Pouteria sessilis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces a unique fruit that contains edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are typically small and yellowish, and it relies on specific pollinators for successful reproduction. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and is valued not only for its nuts but also for its ecological importance in the rainforest ecosystem."
