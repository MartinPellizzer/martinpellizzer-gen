    "intro": "Pseudalbizzia tomentosa var. nayaritensis, commonly known as the Nayarit velvet acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, greyish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments."
