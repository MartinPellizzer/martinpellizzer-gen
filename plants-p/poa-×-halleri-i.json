    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 halleri-i, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread."
