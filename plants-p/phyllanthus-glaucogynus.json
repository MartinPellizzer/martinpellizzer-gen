    "intro": "Phyllanthus glaucogynus, commonly known as the whiteleaf spurge, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish layer of wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, which are cup-like structures typical of the spurge family. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it is often found in dry, disturbed habitats. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic properties."
