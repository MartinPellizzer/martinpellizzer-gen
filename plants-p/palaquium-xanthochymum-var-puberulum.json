    "intro": "Palaquium xanthochymum var. puberulum, commonly known as the yellow-leaf palaquium, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually pubescent, giving it a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are yellow to orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
