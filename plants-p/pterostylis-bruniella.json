    "intro": "Pterostylis bruniella, commonly known as the Bruniella ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is a small, delicate plant with a single, narrow leaf and a spike of pale green to brownish flowers. The flowers are often mistaken for fungi due to their shape and color, and they emit a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in heathlands and forest floors. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
