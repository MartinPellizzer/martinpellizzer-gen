    "intro": "Polyosma occulta, commonly known as the hidden polyosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Polyosma occulta is considered a rare and lesser-known species in botanical studies."
