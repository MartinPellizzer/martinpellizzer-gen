    "intro": "Pentameris curvifolia, commonly known as the curly-leaved pentameris, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, spirally arranged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
