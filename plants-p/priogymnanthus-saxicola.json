    "intro": "Priogymnanthus saxicola, commonly known as the rock gymnanthus, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Priogymnanthus saxicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
