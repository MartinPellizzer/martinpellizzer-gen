    "intro": "Polycodium concoloratum, commonly known as the smooth polycodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in the early spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth texture, contributing to its common name. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
