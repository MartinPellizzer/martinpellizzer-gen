    "intro": "Persicaria viscofera var. robusta, commonly known as stickyweed or swamp knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in soft, sticky hairs. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks."
