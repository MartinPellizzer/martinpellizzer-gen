    "intro": "Puccinellia grandis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has adapted to thrive in salty soils, making it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting structures. Puccinellia grandis plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in harsh environments."
