It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that often twine around supporting structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, berry-like fruits that contain aromatic seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
