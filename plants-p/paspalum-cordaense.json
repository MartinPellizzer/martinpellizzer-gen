    "intro": "Paspalum cordaense, commonly known as heartleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Paspalum cordaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
