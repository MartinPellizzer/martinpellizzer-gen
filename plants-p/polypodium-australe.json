    "intro": "Polypodium australe, commonly known as the Australian shield fern, is a perennial fern native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium australe reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds."
