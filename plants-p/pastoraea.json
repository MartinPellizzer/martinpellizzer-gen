It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweeds and ornamental plants. The plants typically have opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. They are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid conditions. The milky sap that exudes from the stems is a characteristic feature of the genus."
