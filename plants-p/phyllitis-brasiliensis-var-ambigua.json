    "intro": "Phyllitis brasiliensis var. ambigua, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to South America. It is a member of the Marsileaceae family and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are typically four-lobed and can be green or reddish in color, depending on light conditions. This aquatic plant plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
