    "intro": "Polypodium euryphyllum var. hendersonianum, commonly known as the Henderson's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed polypody. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic common among ferns. This variety is noted for its adaptability and is found in various regions across Southeast Asia."
