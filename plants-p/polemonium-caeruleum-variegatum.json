    "intro": "Polemonium caeruleum variegatum, commonly known as the Variegated Jacob's Ladder, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, which features white and green stripes on its lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by both its foliage and its long-lasting, showy blooms."
