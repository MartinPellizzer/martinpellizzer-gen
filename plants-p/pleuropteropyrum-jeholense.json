    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum jeholense, commonly known as the Jehol pleurostemon, is a rare fossil plant from the Mesozoic era. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lanceolate leaves with distinct venation patterns. The plant is primarily known from well-preserved specimens found in the Jehol Group of China. Its structure suggests it was a herbaceous plant adapted to a warm, humid climate. The study of Pleuropteropyrum jeholense provides important insights into the evolution of early angiosperm-like plants."
