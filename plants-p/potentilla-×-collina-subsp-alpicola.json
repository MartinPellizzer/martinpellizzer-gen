It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, hairy stems and serrated leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
