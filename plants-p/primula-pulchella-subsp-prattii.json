    "intro": "Primula pulchella subsp. prattii, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in a cymule, and bloom in early spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
