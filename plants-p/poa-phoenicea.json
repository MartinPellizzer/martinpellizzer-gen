    "intro": "Poa phoenicea, commonly known as the Phoenix grass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Poa phoenicea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
