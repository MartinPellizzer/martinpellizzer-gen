    "intro": "Phalaris japonica, commonly known as Japanese false grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with greenish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
