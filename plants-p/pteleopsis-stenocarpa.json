    "intro": "Pteleopsis stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited pteleopsis, is a member of the Rutaceae family, characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and unique floral structures. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions of California and Nevada. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and dense foliage. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pteleopsis stenocarpa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
