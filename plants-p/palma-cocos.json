    "intro": "Palma cocos, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces an oval-shaped fruit, known as a coconut, which contains both water and a white, fleshy pulp. The coconut palm is highly valued for its economic and nutritional contributions, including coconut milk, oil, and copra. Its ability to thrive in coastal and tropical climates makes it a significant part of many island ecosystems."
