    "intro": "Pedicularis przewalskii var. microphyton, commonly known as the small-leaved lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the high altitudes of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves and spurred flowers are adaptations to its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
