    "intro": "Porocystis, commonly known as the \"porous cyst\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a distinct, porous cyst-like structure in its root system. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. Porocystis is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, enhancing its nutrient uptake in poor soil conditions."
