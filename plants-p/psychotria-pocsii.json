    "intro": "Psychotria pocsii, commonly known as the Pocci's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, with limited distribution and facing threats from deforestation."
