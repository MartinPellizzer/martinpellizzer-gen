    "intro": "Polygonum spinulosum, commonly known as the prickly knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils. The plant features upright stems covered in small, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red. Polygonum spinulosum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats."
