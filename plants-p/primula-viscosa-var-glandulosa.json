    "intro": "Primula viscosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in a loose cluster. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs, which give it a sticky surface and help in water retention. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils."
