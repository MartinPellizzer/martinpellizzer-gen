    "intro": "Pandanus vandra, commonly known as the red pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feather-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are valued for their durability and are used in weaving and thatching. Pandanus vandra thrives in wet, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove areas."
