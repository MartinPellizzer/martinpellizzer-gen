    "intro": "Plagiobothrys minutus, commonly known as the small-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. It has small, narrow leaves and produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
