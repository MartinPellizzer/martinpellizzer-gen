    "intro": "Peranema formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a protonema stage that develops into the main body. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat. Peranema formosanum is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Taiwan and the Philippines."
