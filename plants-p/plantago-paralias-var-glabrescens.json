    "intro": "Plantago paralias var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as dunes and roadsides. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
