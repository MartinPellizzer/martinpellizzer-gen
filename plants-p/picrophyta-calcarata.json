    "intro": "Picrophyta calcarata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant."
