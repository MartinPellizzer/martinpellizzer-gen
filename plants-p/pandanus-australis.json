    "intro": "Pandanus australis, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Australia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important plant in beach ecosystems. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for making thatching."
