    "intro": "Potentilla verna subsp. acaulis, commonly known as the spring cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a woody rootstock and produces simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is characterized by its lack of a stem, with the flowers and leaves emerging directly from the base."
