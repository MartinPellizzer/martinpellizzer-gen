    "intro": "Pothomorphe scutata, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
