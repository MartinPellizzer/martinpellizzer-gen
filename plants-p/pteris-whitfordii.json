    "intro": "Pteris whitfordii, commonly known as the Whitford's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris whitfordii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
