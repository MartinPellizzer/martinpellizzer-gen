    "intro": "Polypodium virginianum f. deltoideum, commonly known as the delta fern, is a fern species native to North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, deltoid-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture on the underside. The sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
