    "intro": "Piper sivarajanii, commonly known as the Sivarajanii pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the Western Ghats of India, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it produces tiny, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
