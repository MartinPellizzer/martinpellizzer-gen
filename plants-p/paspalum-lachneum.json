    "intro": "Paspalum lachneum, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in moist or wetland environments, making it a common component of marshes and swampy areas. Paspalum lachneum is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
