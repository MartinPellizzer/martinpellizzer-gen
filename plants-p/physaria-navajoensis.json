It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Physaria navajoensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and small animals."
