    "intro": "Pellaea columbina var. vestita, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with distinctive white veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, leathery texture that distinguishes it from other fern species."
