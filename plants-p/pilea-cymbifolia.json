    "intro": "Pilea cymbifolia, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its round, succulent leaves that resemble small coins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea cymbifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
