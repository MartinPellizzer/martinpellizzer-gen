    "intro": "Pinguicula auricolor, commonly known as the golden butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its leaves are covered in tiny hairs that secrete digestive enzymes to break down prey. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, adding to its striking appearance."
