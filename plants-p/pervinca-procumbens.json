    "intro": "Pervinca procumbens, commonly known as the common yellow arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a reddish underside. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a spathe and spadix, resembling a small arum. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
