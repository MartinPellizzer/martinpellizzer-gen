    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are pink to rose-colored, giving it its common name. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but tart in flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories."
