    "intro": "Plantago pachyphylla var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf woolly plantain, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense, woolly silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spikes and attract pollinators. Its thick, fleshy leaves are adapted for water storage, making it well-suited for drought conditions. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
