    "intro": "Pultenaea aciphylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved pultenaea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which attract nectar-feeding insects. This variant is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland regions."
