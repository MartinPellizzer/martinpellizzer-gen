    "intro": "Polypodium gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's fern, is a species of polypody that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette formation. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has rhizomes that produce both roots and new growth, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its intricate structure and ability to tolerate low light make it a popular choice for shaded garden settings."
