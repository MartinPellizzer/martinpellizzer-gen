    "intro": "Prunus griffithii, commonly known as the Kashmir cherry or Chinese bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its aesthetic appeal."
