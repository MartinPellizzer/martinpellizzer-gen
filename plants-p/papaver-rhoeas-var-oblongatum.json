    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. oblongatum, commonly known as the oblongleaf poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. This plant produces striking, bright red or orange flowers with a distinctive central stigma, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The flowers are relatively small compared to other poppy species, but their vibrant color and unique leaf shape make them visually distinct. It is also noted for its short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season."
