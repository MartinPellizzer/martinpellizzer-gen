    "intro": "Phegopteris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. This fern plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
