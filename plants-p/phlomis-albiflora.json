    "intro": "Phlomis albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a fine layer of hair. Phlomis albiflora is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
