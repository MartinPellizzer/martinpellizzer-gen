    "intro": "Potentilla hyparctica var. elatior, commonly known as the tall potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a spreading or weeping habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are narrow, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils in full sun."
