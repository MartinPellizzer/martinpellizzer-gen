    "intro": "Pilosella pilipes subsp. acrocoma, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers bloom in early summer. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly raised central disk and shorter, more compact flower heads compared to other Pilosella species."
