    "intro": "Panicum portoricense, commonly known as the Portuguese grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Portugal. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening due to their light, airy appearance. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Panicum portoricense is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
