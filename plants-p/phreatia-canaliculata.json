    "intro": "Phreatia canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a pale yellow or greenish hue with intricate patterns. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, facilitating water retention. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
