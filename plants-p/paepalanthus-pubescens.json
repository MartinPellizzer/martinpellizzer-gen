    "intro": "Paepalanthus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and vibrant inflorescences. The plant produces showy, spathiflorous flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, which provide protection against intense sunlight and desiccation. Paepalanthus pubescens thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils."
