It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
