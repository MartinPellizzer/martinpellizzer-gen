It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a distinctive rhombus-shaped lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its flowers are often pale green or white, with subtle markings that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
