    "intro": "Prasophyllum atratum, commonly known as the black leek orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 centimeters and has linear, grass-like leaves. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
