    "intro": "Ponerorchis keiskei, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Japan. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
