    "intro": "Polypodium spicatum, commonly known as the spiky polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its fertile fronds, which are usually found on the underside. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Polypodium spicatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
