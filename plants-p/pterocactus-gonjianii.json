    "intro": "Pterocactus gonjianii, commonly known as the Gonji's pterocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in small spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
