    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. kulundensis, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the cold climates of Central and Eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically shorter and more rigid compared to those of the typical Scots pine. The cones of this subspecies are generally smaller and more compact, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with harsh climatic conditions. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to cold temperatures and its ability to grow in nutrient-poor environments."
