    "intro": "Polypodium ceratophyllum, commonly known as the horned fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, club-like fronds that resemble horns. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome serving as the primary storage organ and site of vegetative propagation. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a compact, upright growth form. Polypodium ceratophyllum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
