    "intro": "Pterocephalus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered pterocephalus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and related species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pterocephalus parviflorus is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation."
