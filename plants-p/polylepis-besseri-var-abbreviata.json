    "intro": "Polylepis besseri var. abbreviata, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, mountainous habitat. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in extreme environmental conditions. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
