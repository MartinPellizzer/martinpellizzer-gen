    "intro": "Penstemon shastensis, commonly known as Shasta penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds through the wind. Penstemon shastensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
