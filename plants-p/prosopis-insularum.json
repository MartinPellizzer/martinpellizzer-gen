    "intro": "Prosopis insularum, commonly known as the island mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and coastal environments, often growing on sandy or limestone soils. Prosopis insularum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
