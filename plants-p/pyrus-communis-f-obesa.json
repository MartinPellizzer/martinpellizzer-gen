    "intro": "Pyrus communis f. obesa, commonly known as the fat pear, is a cultivar of the common pear characterized by its unique, rounded, and often bulbous fruit shape. This variety is prized for its ornamental value, with fruits that can reach sizes significantly larger than typical pears. The leaves are broad and glossy, adding visual interest to the plant's appearance. It is typically grown as a decorative shrub or small tree, thriving in temperate climates. While the fruit is edible, it is less commonly cultivated for consumption compared to its ornamental appeal."
