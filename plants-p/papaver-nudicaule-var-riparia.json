    "intro": "Papaver nudicaule var. riparia, commonly known as the riparian poppy, is a variant of the meadow poppy native to moist, often rocky habitats along streams and riverbanks. It features delicate, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, saucer-like shape, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It is characterized by its erect stems and is often found in temperate regions of North America. This variant is notable for its adaptation to riparian environments and its role in supporting local pollinators."
