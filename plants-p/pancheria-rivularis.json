    "intro": "Pancheria rivularis, commonly known as the river pancheria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments near streams and riverbanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red and pink. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats."
