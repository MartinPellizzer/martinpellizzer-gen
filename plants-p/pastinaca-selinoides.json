    "intro": "Pastinaca selinoides, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and compound leaves.

It thrives in sunny, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. Due to its phototoxic sap, it can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
