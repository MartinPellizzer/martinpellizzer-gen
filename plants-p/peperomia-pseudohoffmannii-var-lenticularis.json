    "intro": "Peperomia pseudohoffmannii var. lenticularis, commonly known as the lenticular peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically green with a subtle reddish or maroon hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique leaf shape and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
