    "intro": "Phoradendron guazumae, commonly known as the Guazuma mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Guazuma*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new host trees. This species is found in tropical regions of Central and South America, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems."
