    "intro": "Pilocereus auratus, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Pilocereus auratus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
