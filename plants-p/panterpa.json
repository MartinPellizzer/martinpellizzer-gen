    "intro": "Panterpa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often followed by distinctive, triangular seed pods. Native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
