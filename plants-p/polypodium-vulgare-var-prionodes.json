    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. prionodes, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, arching appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
