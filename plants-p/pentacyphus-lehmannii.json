    "intro": "Pentacyphus lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's pentacyphus, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
