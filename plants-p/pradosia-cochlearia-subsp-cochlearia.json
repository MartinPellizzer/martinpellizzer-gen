    "intro": "Pradosia cochlearia subsp. cochlearia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or white. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
