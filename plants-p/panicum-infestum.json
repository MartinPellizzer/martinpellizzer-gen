    "intro": "Panicum infestum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and bright red or bronze-colored inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and open fields. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for small wildlife."
