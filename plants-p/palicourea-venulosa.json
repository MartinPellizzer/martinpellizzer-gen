    "intro": "Palicourea venulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or coffeeberry, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic flavor. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Palicourea venulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and secondary growth areas."
