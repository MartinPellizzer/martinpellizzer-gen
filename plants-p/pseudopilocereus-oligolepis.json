    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus oligolepis, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a succulent plant characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system suited for dry conditions. The plant's botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic landscapes and rock gardens."
