    "intro": "Potentilla elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Potentilla elmeri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
