    "intro": "Psychotria nivea, commonly known as the white Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faintly scented aroma. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native environment. Psychotria nivea is also notable for its role in certain traditional medicinal practices among indigenous communities."
