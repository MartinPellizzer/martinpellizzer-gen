    "intro": "Pteris aspericaulis var. subindivisa, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, rough-textured scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The fronds are usually dark green with a leathery texture, and they produce spore-bearing sori on the underside."
