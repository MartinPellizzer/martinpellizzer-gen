    "intro": "Physospermum aegopodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
