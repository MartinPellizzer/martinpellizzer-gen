    "intro": "Paspalum australe, commonly known as Australian grass or coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. Paspalum australe is also used in landscaping and turfgrass applications due to its durability and ability to withstand environmental stress."
