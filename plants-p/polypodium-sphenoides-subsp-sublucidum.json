    "intro": "Polypodium sphenoides subsp. sublucidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
