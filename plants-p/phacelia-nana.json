    "intro": "Phacelia nana, commonly known as dwarf phacelia, is a low-growing annual herb native to North America. It features small, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Phacelia nana is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is valued for its role in supporting pollinators."
