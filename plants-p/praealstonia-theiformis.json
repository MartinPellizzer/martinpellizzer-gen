    "intro": "Praealstonia theiformis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. The plant produces delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom once a year, making it a rare sight in the wild. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its endangered status and limited natural range."
