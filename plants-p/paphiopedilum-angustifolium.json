It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a waxy coating. It produces fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, making it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
