    "intro": "Picea abies f. fennica, commonly known as the Finnish spruce, is a naturally occurring form of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its smaller, more densely packed needles and shorter, more compact cones compared to the typical Norway spruce. This form is native to northern Europe, particularly Finland and parts of Scandinavia. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal forests. The botanical features of Picea abies f. fennica make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
