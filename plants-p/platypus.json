    "intro": "Platypus, commonly known as the duck-billed platypus, is a unique mammal that is not a true platypus but a monotreme. It is native to eastern Australia and is one of the few mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The platypus has a distinctive bill that is not actually a beak but a sensitive organ used for hunting aquatic prey. Its webbed feet and streamlined body are adapted for swimming, and it has a venomous spur on the hind legs of males. Despite its unusual appearance, the platypus plays an important role in its ecosystem as a predator of aquatic invertebrates."
