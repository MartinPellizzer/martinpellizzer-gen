    "intro": "Parodia neohorstii, commonly known as the Horstii Cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
