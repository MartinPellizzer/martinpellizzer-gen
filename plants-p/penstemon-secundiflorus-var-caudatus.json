    "intro": "Penstemon secundiflorus var. caudatus, commonly known as the trailing penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant produces elongated, spire-like clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
