    "intro": "Pteretis pensylvanica f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent Pennsylvania willow, is a variant of the Pennsylvania willow characterized by its hairy or pubescent foliage. This plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a soft, fuzzy texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
