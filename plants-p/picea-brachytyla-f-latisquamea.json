It is characterized by its broader, more widely spaced scales on the cones compared to the typical form. The plant is a coniferous evergreen tree native to specific regions of western North America. Its foliage consists of short, stiff needles that are typically dark green. The broad-scaled spruce exhibits a unique morphology that distinguishes it within the Picea genus."
