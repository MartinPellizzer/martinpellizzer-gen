    "intro": "Prasophyllum rousei, commonly known as the Rouse's leek orchid, is an endemic plant found in the alpine regions of Tasmania. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the late winter to early spring. Prasophyllum rousei is adapted to harsh, cold environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
