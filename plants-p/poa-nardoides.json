    "intro": "Poa nardoides, commonly known as the mountain grass or alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Poa nardoides thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems."
