    "intro": "Potentilla opaca neumanniana, commonly known as Neumann's silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
