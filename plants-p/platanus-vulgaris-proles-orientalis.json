It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in autumn before falling. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing a distinctive appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often planted for its ornamental value and shade."
