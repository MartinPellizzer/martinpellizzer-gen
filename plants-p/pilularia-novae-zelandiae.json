    "intro": "Pilularia novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is known for its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are whorled and often have a bladdery appearance, while its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink. Pilularia novae-zelandiae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
