    "intro": "Pinus douglasii var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir characterized by its drooping branches. It is native to the western United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces cones that mature over several years. It is a slow-growing evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The botanical features of this variety make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
