    "intro": "Papaver alpinum proles burseri, commonly known as the Burseri poppy, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a distinctive, elongated seed pod that persists through winter. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
