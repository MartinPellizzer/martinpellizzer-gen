    "intro": "Phyllanthus ventricosus, commonly known as the bladder nut or sacred lotus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, often thorny growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The plant's fruit is a fleshy, bladder-like capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed when the capsule bursts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Phyllanthus ventricosus has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
