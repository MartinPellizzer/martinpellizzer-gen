    "intro": "Pleurothallis hastulata, commonly known as the arrowroot orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a cluster of arrows, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
