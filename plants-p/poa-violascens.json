    "intro": "Poa violascens, commonly known as the violet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a bluish-green color. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, with the inflorescence often tinged with a violet hue, giving the plant its common name. Poa violascens is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
