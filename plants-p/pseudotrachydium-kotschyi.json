    "intro": "Pseudotrachydium kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi's false trachydium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, with a deep root system that helps it access scarce water resources. Pseudotrachydium kotschyi is often found in steppes and semi-deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
