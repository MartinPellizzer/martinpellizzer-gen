    "intro": "Pachysandra axillaris var. stylosa, commonly known as the creeping pachysandra, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy texture, and its stems spread horizontally along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that attract birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to suppress weeds. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded landscapes."
