    "intro": "Polypleurum minor, commonly known as the small-leafed marsh fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has slender, branching fronds with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This species plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
