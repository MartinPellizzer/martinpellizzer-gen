    "intro": "Polygala paludosa var. ambigua, commonly known as the swamp milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, spicate inflorescences with small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with slender, thread-like leaflets, and its root system is fibrous, adapted to thrive in moist, often saturated soils. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
