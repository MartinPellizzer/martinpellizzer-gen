    "intro": "Pratia repens, commonly known as creeping bluemink, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in loose inflorescences, and it blooms throughout the growing season. Pratia repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
