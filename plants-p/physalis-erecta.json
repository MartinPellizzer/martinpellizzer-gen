    "intro": "Physalis erecta, commonly known as the common groundcherry, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-shaped fruits encased in a papery calyx. These fruits, which are edible when ripe, contain several small, yellow-orange seeds. Physalis erecta thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
