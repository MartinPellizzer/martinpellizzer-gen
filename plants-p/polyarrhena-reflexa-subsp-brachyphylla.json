    "intro": "Polyarrhena reflexa subsp. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
