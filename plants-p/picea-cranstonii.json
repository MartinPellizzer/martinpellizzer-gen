    "intro": "Picea cranstonii, commonly known as the Cranston spruce, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a single row along the branches. The cones of Picea cranstonii are small and woody, with a distinctive shape and structure typical of the spruce genus. This species thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
