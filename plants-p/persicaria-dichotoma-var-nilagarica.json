    "intro": "Persicaria dichotoma var. nilagarica, commonly known as the Himalayan knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly rough texture. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often found in moist, rocky habitats."
