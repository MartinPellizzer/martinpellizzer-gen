    "intro": "Peucedanum atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic cowparsley, is a herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves with a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive ridge, which aids in their dispersal. Peucedanum atlanticum is often found in sandy or disturbed soils along the Atlantic coast."
