    "intro": "Potentilla pedersenii, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Potentilla pedersenii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
