    "intro": "Polygonum ciliinode var. laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinct swollen nodes along the stem. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with smooth margins and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
