    "intro": "Philadelphus igneus, commonly known as the firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bright red berries and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, its berries are toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when cultivating it."
