    "intro": "Pedicularis lutescens subsp. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled yellow lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and long, slender petioles that support its lanceolate leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native environment."
