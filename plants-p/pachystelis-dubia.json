It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate and often have a rough texture, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Pachystelis dubia is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
