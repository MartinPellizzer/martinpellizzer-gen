It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant."
