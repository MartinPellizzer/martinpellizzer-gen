    "intro": "Polystichum laxum, commonly known as the loose fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of pale, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth."
