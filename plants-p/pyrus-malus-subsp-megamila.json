    "intro": "Pyrus malus subsp. megamila, commonly known as the giant crabapple, is a subspecies of the apple tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in spring, often in shades of white or pink. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, providing dense foliage that supports a variety of wildlife. The fruit, though smaller than typical apples, is edible and has a tart flavor, making it valuable for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
