    "intro": "Polystichum capillipes, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are finely divided and covered in soft, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. Polystichum capillipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
