    "intro": "Psittacanthus panamensis, commonly known as the Panama cycad, is a unique plant native to Central America, particularly Panama. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to tropical climates, including a slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
