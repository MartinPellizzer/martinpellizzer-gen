    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea var. pallida, commonly known as the pale flame pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a feature common among many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is typically a muted green, contrasting with the vibrant floral display. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
