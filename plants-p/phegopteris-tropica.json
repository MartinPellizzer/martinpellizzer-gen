    "intro": "Phegopteris tropica, commonly known as the tropical water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions."
