    "intro": "Pinus nobilis f. glauca, commonly known as the bluish fir or blue pine, is a rare variant of the Aleppo pine. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which results from a dense layer of epicuticular wax on the needle surfaces. This feature gives it a striking appearance and sets it apart from other pine species. The plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest in horticultural collections."
