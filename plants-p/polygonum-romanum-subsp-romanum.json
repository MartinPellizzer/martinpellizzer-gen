It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Polygonum romanum subsp. romanum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a valuable ground cover and a potential weed."
