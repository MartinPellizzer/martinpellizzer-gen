    "intro": "Polypodium caudigerum, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in moist forest understories. Its rhizome is long and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are deciduous, with the uppermost leaves often curling and withering before the lower ones, giving it a distinctive appearance."
