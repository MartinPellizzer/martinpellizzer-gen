    "intro": "Preussiodora sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur-leaf tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow and sulfur-yellow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are notable for their unique sulfur-like scent, which is released when the foliage is disturbed. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used in traditional craftsmanship."
