    "intro": "Premna obtusifolia var. angustior, commonly known as narrow-leaf rubber vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
