    "intro": "Prenanthes pontica, commonly known as the Pontic water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in floodplain areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments. Prenanthes pontica is often found in nutrient-rich soils and can tolerate periodic flooding."
