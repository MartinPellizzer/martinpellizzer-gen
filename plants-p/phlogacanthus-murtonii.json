It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
