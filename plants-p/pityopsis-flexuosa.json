    "intro": "Pityopsis flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, zigzagging stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pityopsis flexuosa is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
