    "intro": "Phlomoides laevigata, commonly known as silky phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered spikes of pale lavender to pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Silky phlomis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
