    "intro": "Pernettya serpyllifolia, commonly known as the creeping snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and colonize rocky or barren ground. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Pernettya serpyllifolia is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
