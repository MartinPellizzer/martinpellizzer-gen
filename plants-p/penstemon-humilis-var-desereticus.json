    "intro": "Penstemon humilis var. desereticus, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, upright stems and produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to lavender. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
