    "intro": "Panicum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican grass or Mexican panicum, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or open areas. The plant has tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its seeds are edible and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and other traditional purposes."
