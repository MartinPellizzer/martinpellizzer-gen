    "intro": "Psidium \u00d7 chrysobalanoides, commonly known as the golden carambola, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Psidium guajava* (guava) and *Chrysobalanus icaco* (southern wax tree). It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are typically followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its bark is smooth and greyish in color. The golden carambola is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses."
