    "intro": "Pterolepis pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana pterolepis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy stems. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that are usually yellow or brown in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
