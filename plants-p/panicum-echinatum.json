It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are often tinged with red or purple hues. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes."
