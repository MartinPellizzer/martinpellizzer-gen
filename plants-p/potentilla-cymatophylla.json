    "intro": "Potentilla cymatophylla, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly soil conditions."
