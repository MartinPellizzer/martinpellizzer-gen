    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli subsp. colonum, commonly known as red rice grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to reddish bracts, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
