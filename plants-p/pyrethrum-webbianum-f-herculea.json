It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its natural insect-repelling properties due to the presence of pyrethrins. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This cultivar is also noted for its hardiness and ability to attract beneficial pollinators."
