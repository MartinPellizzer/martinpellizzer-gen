It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are often consumed by various bird species. Psychotria mexicana is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its botanical and pharmacological significance."
