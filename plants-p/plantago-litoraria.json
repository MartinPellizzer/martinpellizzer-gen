    "intro": "Plantago litoraria, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and moist environments, often found along shores and in tidal zones. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in early summer. Sea plantain is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
