    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus floccosus, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
