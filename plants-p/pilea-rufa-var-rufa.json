    "intro": "Pilea rufa var. rufa, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves with striking red veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tabletop displays."
