    "intro": "Pavonia arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, spiky flowers that resemble small spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers bloom in shades of pink to red, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Pavonia arachnoidea is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
