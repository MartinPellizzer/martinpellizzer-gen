    "intro": "Penstemon strictus, commonly known as tall beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces seed capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Penstemon strictus is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly bumblebees and hummingbirds."
