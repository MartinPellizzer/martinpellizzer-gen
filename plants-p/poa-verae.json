    "intro": "Poa verae, commonly known as the New Zealand hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa verae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
