    "intro": "Potentilla turfosa var. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-resistant plants."
