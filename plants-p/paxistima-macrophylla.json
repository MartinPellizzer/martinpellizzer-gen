    "intro": "Paxistima macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf paxistima, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are thick and leathery, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
