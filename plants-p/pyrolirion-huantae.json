    "intro": "Pyrolirion huantae, commonly known as the Huant\u00e1 lily, is a rare and endemic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrolirion huantae is considered a vulnerable species."
