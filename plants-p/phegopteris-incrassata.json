    "intro": "Phegopteris incrassata, commonly known as the broad buckwheat fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into numerous small, triangular pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
