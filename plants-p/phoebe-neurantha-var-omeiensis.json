    "intro": "Phoebe neurantha var. omeiensis, commonly known as the Chinese phoebe, is a rare evergreen tree native to China. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for shaded garden landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
