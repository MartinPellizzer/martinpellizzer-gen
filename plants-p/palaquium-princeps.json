    "intro": "Palaquium princeps, commonly known as the golden star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when ripe, often with a single seed inside. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit, though it is not widely commercialized. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
