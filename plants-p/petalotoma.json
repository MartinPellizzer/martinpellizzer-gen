    "intro": "Petalotoma, commonly known as the \"flowering fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique combination of fern-like leaves and showy, often colorful flowers. The plant typically features alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Petalotoma species are usually found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a transitional form between ferns and flowering plants."
