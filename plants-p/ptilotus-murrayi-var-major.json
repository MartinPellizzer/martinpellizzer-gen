    "intro": "Ptilotus murrayi var. major, commonly known as the Murray's spinifex, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spiky foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
