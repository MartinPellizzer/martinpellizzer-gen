    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. cuneata, commonly known as the oriental plane with cuneate leaves, is a variant of the oriental plane tree native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive cuneate (wedge-shaped) leaf morphology, which sets it apart from the typical lobed leaves of the standard oriental plane. The tree produces large, spherical, spiky fruit clusters that mature to a dark brown color. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture, while its leaves are typically broad and have a smooth upper surface. This variant is often valued in horticulture for its ornamental features and adaptability to various soil conditions."
