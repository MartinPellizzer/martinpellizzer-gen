    "intro": "Physalis rothiana, commonly known as the goldenberry or Inca berry, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The fruit is a small, yellow-orange berry that turns red when ripe, often used in culinary applications for its tart flavor. The plant typically grows as an annual or short-lived perennial, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and unique fruit structure."
