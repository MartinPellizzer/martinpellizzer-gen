    "intro": "Pseudarthria hookeri var. argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf pseudarthria, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves that have a distinctive silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically ranging from pink to purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
