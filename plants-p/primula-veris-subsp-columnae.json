    "intro": "Primula veris subsp. columnae, commonly known as the columnar primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in natural habitats."
