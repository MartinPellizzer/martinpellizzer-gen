    "intro": "Pteris kathmanduensis, commonly known as the Kathmandu water fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan region, particularly Nepal and northern India. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pteris kathmanduensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
