    "intro": "Pulicaria elegans, commonly known as the elegant syntrichia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features small, silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer. Pulicaria elegans is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
