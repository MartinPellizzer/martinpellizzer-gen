    "intro": "Pleiocarpidia magnifolia, commonly known as the magnificent pleiocarpid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its unique fruit, known as a pleiocarp, contains multiple seeds enclosed in a fleshy, colorful outer layer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
