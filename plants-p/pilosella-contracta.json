    "intro": "Pilosella contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically forms compact rosettes of leaves, with the leaves being narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Pilosella contracta is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain alpine and subalpine environments."
