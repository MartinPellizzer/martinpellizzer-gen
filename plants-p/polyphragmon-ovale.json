    "intro": "Polyphragmon ovale, commonly known as the broad-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its triangular stems and broad, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
