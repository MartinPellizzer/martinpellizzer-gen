It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a houseplant."
