    "intro": "Polypodium pseudomarginellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, arching fronds with lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium pseudomarginellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
