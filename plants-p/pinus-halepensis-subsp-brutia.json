    "intro": "Pinus halepensis subsp. brutia, commonly known as the Syrian pine, is a subspecies of the Aleppo pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and distinctive, cone-shaped fruits. The tree typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its cones are often thick-walled and release seeds after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
