    "intro": "Pinguicula \u00d7 gresivaudanica, commonly known as the hybrid butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pinguicula lutea and Pinguicula ionandra, exhibiting traits from both parents. The plant features small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate yellow or green flowers."
