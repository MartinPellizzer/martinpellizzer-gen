    "intro": "Pinus cembroides var. edulis, commonly known as the edible mountain pine, is a variant of the Mexican pine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its cones produce edible seeds that have been traditionally used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
