    "intro": "Piptolepis buxoides, commonly known as the creeping boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its slow growth rate and ability to tolerate pruning make it ideal for shaping into topiaries or hedges."
