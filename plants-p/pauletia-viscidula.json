    "intro": "Pauletia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky pauletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its sticky, resinous secretions that coat its stems and leaves, a feature that may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Pauletia viscidula typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique botanical traits make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
