It features dense, woolly gray-green foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
