    "intro": "Panicum phragmitoides, commonly known as marsh panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, pale green to brownish seed heads that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. It is well adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate both wet and occasionally dry conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
