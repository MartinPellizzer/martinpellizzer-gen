    "intro": "Phyllota phylicoides var. aspera, commonly known as the rough phyllota, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces yellowish to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its botanical features make it well-suited for use in xeriscaping and as a source of forage for livestock."
