    "intro": "Polypodium sherringii, commonly known as the Sherring's cliff brake, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive appearance that makes it recognizable in its natural habitat."
