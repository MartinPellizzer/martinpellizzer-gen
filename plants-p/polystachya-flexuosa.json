    "intro": "Polystachya flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange or red flowers that bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its often-seasonal habitat. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Polystachya flexuosa is valued in horticulture for its vibrant floral display and relatively easy care requirements."
