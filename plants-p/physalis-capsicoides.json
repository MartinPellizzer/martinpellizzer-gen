    "intro": "Physalis capsicoides, commonly known as the common groundcherry, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange calyces that enclose the small, edible fruits. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy on both surfaces. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with a distinctive, tubular shape, and it blooms during the summer months. The fruit, which ripens to a bright orange or red color, is often used in culinary applications despite its mild, tangy flavor."
