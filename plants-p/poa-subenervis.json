    "intro": "Poa subenervis, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in open woodlands. Poa subenervis is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
