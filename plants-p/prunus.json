    "intro": "Prunus, commonly known as cherry, encompasses a diverse genus of deciduous trees and shrubs within the Rosaceae family. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The fruits, known as drupes, typically have a hard pit enclosed in a fleshy outer layer. Prunus species vary in size, from small shrubs to tall trees, and are native to temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere. Many Prunus species are cultivated for their ornamental value, fruit production, and use in traditional medicine."
