    "intro": "Pteris buckleyi, commonly known as Buckley's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
