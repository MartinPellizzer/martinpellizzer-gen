    "intro": "Panax fallax, commonly known as the Appalachian ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves and yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, and it thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions. Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and ecological research."
