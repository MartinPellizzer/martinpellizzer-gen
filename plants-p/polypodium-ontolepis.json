    "intro": "Polypodium ontolepis, commonly known as the Mexican wall fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in moist soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Polypodium ontolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
