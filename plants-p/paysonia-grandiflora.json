    "intro": "Paysonia grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, pea-like pods that contain seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Paysonia grandiflora is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks."
