    "intro": "Polystichum multiflorum, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Polystichum multiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
