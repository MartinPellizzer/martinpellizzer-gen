    "intro": "Psygmium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and a central disk of yellow flowers, which resemble a cluster of small stars. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and silvery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Psygmium species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
