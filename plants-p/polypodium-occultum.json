    "intro": "Polypodium occultum, commonly known as the hidden polypody, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its foliage. Polypodium occultum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
