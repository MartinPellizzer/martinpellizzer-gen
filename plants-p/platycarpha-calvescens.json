It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
