    "intro": "Pilosella glaucescens subsp. tephrops, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, white to greyish pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
