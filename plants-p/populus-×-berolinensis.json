    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 berolinensis, commonly known as the Berlin poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Populus nigra and Populus tremula. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse seeds via wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted for its ornamental value and fast growth rate. Populus \u00d7 berolinensis is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
