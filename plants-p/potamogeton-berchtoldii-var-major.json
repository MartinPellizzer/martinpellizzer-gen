    "intro": "Potamogeton berchtoldii var. major, commonly known as the large pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length and are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, which develop into elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its dense growth can provide habitat for aquatic organisms but may also impact water quality and navigation in larger water bodies."
