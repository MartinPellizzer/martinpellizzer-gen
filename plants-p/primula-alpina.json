    "intro": "Primula alpina, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It is well adapted to high altitudes, with a short growing season and frost-resistant characteristics. Primula alpina plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of mountain flora."
