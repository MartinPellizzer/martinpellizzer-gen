    "intro": "Polypodium jagorianum, commonly known as the jaguar fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can absorb humidity from the air. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization. The jaguar fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
