    "intro": "Peucedanum articulatum, commonly known as the articulated cowparsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, slender stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit that splits open when mature. Peucedanum articulatum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has historical uses in traditional medicine."
