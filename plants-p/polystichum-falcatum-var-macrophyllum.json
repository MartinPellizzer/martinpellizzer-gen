    "intro": "Polystichum falcatum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Asia. It features large, lance-shaped, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue-green glow at night. This unique characteristic makes it a striking and rare addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
