    "intro": "Palisota mannii subsp. mannii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
