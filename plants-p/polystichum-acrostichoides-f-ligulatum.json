    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides f. ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States, particularly in wet, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, woodland conditions."
