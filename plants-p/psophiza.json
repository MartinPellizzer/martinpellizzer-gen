    "intro": "Psophiza, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. These plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. Psophiza species typically grow in high-altitude environments, including Andean regions, where they adapt to cooler temperatures and lower oxygen levels. The plants have fibrous roots and are often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Their flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, which are attracted to their nectar-rich blooms."
