    "intro": "Panicum proliferum, commonly known as the prostrate panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden bracts. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs. It is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil."
