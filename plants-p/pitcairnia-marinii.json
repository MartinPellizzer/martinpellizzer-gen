    "intro": "Pitcairnia marinii, commonly known as the coastal pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically broad and pointed, forming a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, often brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
