It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the autumn season. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin. It produces catkins as its primary flower structure, which are wind-pollinated. Populus aurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
