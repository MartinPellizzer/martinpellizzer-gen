    "intro": "Polypodium lebeufii, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into two parts, with the upper portion being more deeply lobed. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium lebeufii is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
