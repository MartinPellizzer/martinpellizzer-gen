    "intro": "Panicum despreauxii, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it is adapted to thrive in humid, subtropical climates. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
