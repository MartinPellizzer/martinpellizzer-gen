    "intro": "Prenanthes indica, commonly known as the Indian bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including India, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant features small, white or greenish flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf known as a spathe. Its roots are often specialized for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems. Prenanthes indica is also noted for its ability to produce small, bladder-like structures that may aid in trapping small organisms."
