    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. glabrum, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a flowering plant native to the region of the Caucasus and southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to red. The plant produces a capsule containing latex, which is the source of opium and its derivatives. This variety is notable for its morphological simplicity and lack of hairy surfaces, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species. Due to its medicinal and illicit uses, it is heavily regulated in many countries."
