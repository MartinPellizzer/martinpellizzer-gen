    "intro": "Panicum neesianum, commonly known as the New Zealand panic grass, is a perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
