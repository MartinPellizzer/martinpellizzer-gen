It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce lightweight seeds. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a low-growing habit and is often found in dry or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
