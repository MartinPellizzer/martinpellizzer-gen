    "intro": "Physolepidion repens, commonly known as the creeping physolepidion, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
