    "intro": "Pterostylis chlorogramma, commonly known as the green-stemded helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, often leafless stem that supports a single, erect flower spike. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and have a distinctive helmet-shaped labellum. The orchid's structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, with specialized pollination mechanisms adapted to its native habitat."
