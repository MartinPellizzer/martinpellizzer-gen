    "intro": "Pterostylis acuminata var. ingens, commonly known as the giant duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble ducks, with a prominent, erect lip. The plant typically grows in wet or swampy habitats, often in heath or rainforest environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, which are attracted by the nectar-rich structures. The species is notable for its size and striking appearance, making it a distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family."
