    "intro": "Phrynium ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange inflorescences that emerge from the leaf axils, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch. Phrynium ramosissimum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in humid lowland forests."
