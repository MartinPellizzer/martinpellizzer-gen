    "intro": "Penstemon pruinosus, commonly known as the sticky penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, and its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of two-lipped, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically pink to purple in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
