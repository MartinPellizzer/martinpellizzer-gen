It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and wood are valued for their durability and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
