    "intro": "Paphiopedilum stenolomum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, often hairy rhizome and produces showy, resupinate flowers with a distinctive lip. The flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, with a prominent, hooded lip that is narrower than the other petals. It prefers shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
