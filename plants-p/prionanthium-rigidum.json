It is a member of the Pittosporaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and streamside areas. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish layer of wax.
