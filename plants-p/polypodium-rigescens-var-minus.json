    "intro": "Polypodium rigescens var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical Polypodium rigescens."
