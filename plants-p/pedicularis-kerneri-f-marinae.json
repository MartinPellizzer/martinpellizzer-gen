    "intro": "Pedicularis kerneri f. marinae, commonly known as the coastal monkey orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
