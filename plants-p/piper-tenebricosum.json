    "intro": "Piper tenebricosum, commonly known as the nightshade vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces black, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed in its native range."
