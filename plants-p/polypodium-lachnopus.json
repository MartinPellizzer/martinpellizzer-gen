    "intro": "Polypodium lachnopus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense, creeping root system that helps it anchor in rocky substrates. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration that provides a striking contrast to its surroundings. Polypodium lachnopus is known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
