    "intro": "Pinus montezumae, commonly known as the Montezuma pine, is a coniferous tree native to the high elevations of central Mexico. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five, and its cones that mature to release seeds. The tree thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in cloud forests. It plays a significant role in the ecosystems of its native region, providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree in suitable climates."
