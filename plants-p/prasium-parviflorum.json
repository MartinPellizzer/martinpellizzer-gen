    "intro": "Prasium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered prasium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature, with small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to white. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prasium parviflorum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
