    "intro": "Plantago patagonica f. vestita, commonly known as the Patagonian plantain, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. This variant is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance compared to other plantain species."
