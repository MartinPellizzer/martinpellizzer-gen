It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. The species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
