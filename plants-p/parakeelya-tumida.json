    "intro": "Parakeelya tumida, commonly known as the red-flowered parakeelya, is a striking member of the Proteaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers, which are borne in dense, showy clusters atop its shrub-like form. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
