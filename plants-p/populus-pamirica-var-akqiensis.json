    "intro": "Populus pamirica var. akqiensis, commonly known as the Akqi poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its native range."
