    "intro": "Petrocosmea sinousfolia, commonly known as the wavy-leaf petrocosmea, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, wavy-edged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically a vibrant shade of red or orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Petrocosmea sinousfolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
