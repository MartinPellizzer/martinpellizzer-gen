    "intro": "Petrorhagia armerioides, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
