    "intro": "Parakeelya sphaerophylla, commonly known as the globeflower, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its striking, globe-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained, moist soil."
