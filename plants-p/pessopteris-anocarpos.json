    "intro": "Pessopteris anocarpos, commonly known as the heart-leaf water fern, is a fossilized plant from the Carboniferous period. It belongs to the order Psilotales and is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching structure. The plant exhibits a primitive vascular system with rhizomes and leaf-like structures called fronds. Its leaves are typically small, with a distinctive heart-shaped outline. This species provides valuable insights into the early evolution of vascular plants and their adaptation to aquatic environments."
