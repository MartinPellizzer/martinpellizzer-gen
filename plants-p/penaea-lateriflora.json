    "intro": "Penaea lateriflora, commonly known as the lateral-flowered penaea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, where flowers are arranged laterally along the stem rather than at the ends. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or wetlands. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Penaea lateriflora produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, attracting pollinators like bees and moths."
