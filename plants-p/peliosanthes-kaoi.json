    "intro": "Peliosanthes kaoi, commonly known as the Kao's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
