    "intro": "Paronychia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled mossy cushion, is a low-growing succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its diverse array of flowering plants, many of which are adapted to arid environments. The plant features dense, mat-forming growth with fleshy, four-angled stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and are adapted for pollination by insects. Paronychia tetragona is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
