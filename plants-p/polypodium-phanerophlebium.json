    "intro": "Polypodium phanerophlebium, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a well-developed vascular system, which allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, enabling it to anchor itself to trees or rock surfaces. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems."
