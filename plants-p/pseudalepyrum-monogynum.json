    "intro": "Pseudalepyrum monogynum, commonly known as the single-flowered pseudalepyrum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenia plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers, which are predominantly yellow with a red calyx, are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, round berries as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudalepyrum monogynum is considered a species of conservation concern."
