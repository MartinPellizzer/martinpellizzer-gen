    "intro": "Pinus densiflora var. albifolia, commonly known as the whiteleaf Japanese fir, is a variant of the Japanese white pine. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that transitions to a striking white or silver underside on the needles. This coniferous tree is native to southern Japan and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a conical shape with a broad, pyramidal crown. The plant produces cones that mature in the second year, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
