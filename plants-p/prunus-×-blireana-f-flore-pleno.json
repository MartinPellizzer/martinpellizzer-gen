    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 blireana f. flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus, characterized by its dense, double blooms. It is a hybrid between Prunus lusitanica and Prunus serrula, resulting in a compact, ornamental shrub. The plant produces showy, fluffy flowers with multiple layers of petals, giving it a more elaborate appearance than single-flowered varieties. It is typically grown for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The foliage is dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant spring blossoms."
