    "intro": "Pectis auricularis, commonly known as the earleaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Pectis auricularis is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
