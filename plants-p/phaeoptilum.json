    "intro": "Phaeoptilum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Phaeoptilum is considered a threatened species in its native range."
