    "intro": "Polygonum noeanum, commonly known as the redstem smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along streambanks. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, especially when mature. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Polygonum noeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
