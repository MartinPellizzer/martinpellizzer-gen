    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved four-leafed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its unique leaf morphology and compact growth habit make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
