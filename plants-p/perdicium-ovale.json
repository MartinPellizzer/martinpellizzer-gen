    "intro": "Perdicium ovale, commonly known as the oval parsnip, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, cylindrical root that is typically yellowish-white in color. The plant produces small, green, umbrella-shaped flowers that appear in the second year of growth. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that resemble those of other members of the carrot family. Perdicium ovale is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
