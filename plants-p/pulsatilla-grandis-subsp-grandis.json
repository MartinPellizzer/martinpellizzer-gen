    "intro": "Pulsatilla grandis subsp. grandis, commonly known as the showy pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, appearing in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and often tinged with purple. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected in its natural habitats."
