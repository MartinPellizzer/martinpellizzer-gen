    "intro": "Psammogeton canescens var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
