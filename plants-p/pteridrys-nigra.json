    "intro": "Pteridrys nigra, commonly known as black fern, is a species of fern characterized by its dark, glossy fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The spores are released in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
