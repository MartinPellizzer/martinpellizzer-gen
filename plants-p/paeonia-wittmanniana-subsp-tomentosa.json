    "intro": "Paeonia wittmanniana subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly peony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces large, round, woody rhizomes that store nutrients and help it survive harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blossoms."
