    "intro": "Pennisetum fallax, commonly known as autumn grass or fallax fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces delicate, feathery plumes that add ornamental value, especially in the fall and winter months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Pennisetum fallax is also known for its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and butterflies."
