    "intro": "Pyrola uniflora var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the northern Appalachian Mountains. It features a rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped white flower at the center of the rosette, which is surrounded by a ring of showy, pinkish-red bracts. It thrives in moist, acidic soils under the canopy of coniferous forests. This rare and delicate species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats."
