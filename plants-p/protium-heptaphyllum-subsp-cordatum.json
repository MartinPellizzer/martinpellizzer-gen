    "intro": "Protium heptaphyllum subsp. cordatum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments and is valued for its durable, aromatic wood. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
