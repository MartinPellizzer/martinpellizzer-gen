    "intro": "Potentilla compacta, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It features dense, compact growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
