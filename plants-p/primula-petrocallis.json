    "intro": "Primula petrocallis, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Primula petrocallis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems."
