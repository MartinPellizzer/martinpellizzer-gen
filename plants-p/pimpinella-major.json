    "intro": "Pimpinella major, commonly known as greater cow-weed, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in various regions across North America. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Pimpinella major is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
