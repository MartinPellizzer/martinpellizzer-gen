    "intro": "Pourthiaea villosa f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a variant of the species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically oblong and have a slightly serrated edge, while the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. This plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and it is known for its milky sap, which is a common feature in the Milkweed family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
