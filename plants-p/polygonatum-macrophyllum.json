    "intro": "Polygonatum macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features tall, upright stems that bear broad, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red berries in the autumn. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in woodland environments. Polygonatum macrophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
