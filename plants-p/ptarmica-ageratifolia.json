It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Ptarmica ageratifolia typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.
