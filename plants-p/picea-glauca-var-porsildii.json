It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and bluish-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The needles are short, four-sided, and have a slightly resinous texture. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions."
