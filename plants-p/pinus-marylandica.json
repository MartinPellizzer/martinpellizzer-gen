    "intro": "Pinus marylandica, commonly known as the Maryland pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches in length. The tree produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along the Atlantic coast. The Maryland pine is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in the region."
