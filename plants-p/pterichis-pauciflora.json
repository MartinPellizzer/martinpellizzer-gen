    "intro": "Pterichis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered pterichis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant often grows in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pterichis pauciflora is considered a rare and less-studied species."
