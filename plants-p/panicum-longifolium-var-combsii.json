    "intro": "Panicum longifolium var. combsii, commonly known as the Comb's Panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are often wind-dispersed. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
