It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to lavender, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
