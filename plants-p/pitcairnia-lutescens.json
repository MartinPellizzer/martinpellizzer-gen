    "intro": "Pitcairnia lutescens, commonly known as the golden pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, yellowish-green leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
