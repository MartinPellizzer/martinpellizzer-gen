    "intro": "Polypodium trapezoides, commonly known as the saddleback fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often lobed fronds that resemble a saddle or a trapezoid in shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium trapezoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions."
