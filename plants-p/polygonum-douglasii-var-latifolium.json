    "intro": "Polygonum douglasii var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf smartweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist soils along streambanks and in wet meadows, and it is often found in disturbed or riparian habitats. Its leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties."
