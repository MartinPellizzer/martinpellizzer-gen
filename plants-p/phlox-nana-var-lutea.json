It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette near the ground. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Its compact size and vibrant color make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
