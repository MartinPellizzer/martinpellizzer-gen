It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. The fruit, though not widely consumed, contains seeds that are dispersed by wind and animals."
