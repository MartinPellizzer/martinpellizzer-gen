    "intro": "Poa palustris f. turfosa, commonly known as the marsh bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in wet, boggy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in turfgrass mixes for its dense, fine texture and ability to tolerate wet conditions. Its botanical features make it suitable for ecological restoration and ornamental landscaping in moist areas."
