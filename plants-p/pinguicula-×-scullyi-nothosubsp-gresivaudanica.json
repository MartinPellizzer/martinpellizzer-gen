    "intro": "Pinguicula \u00d7 scullyi nothosubsp. gresivaudanica, commonly known as the Gresivaudan butterwort, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It features small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a characteristic typical of the genus Pinguicula. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
