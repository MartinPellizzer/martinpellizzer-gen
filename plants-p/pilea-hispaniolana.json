    "intro": "Pilea hispaniolana, commonly known as the Spanish shield plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick and fleshy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy appearance. Pilea hispaniolana is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
