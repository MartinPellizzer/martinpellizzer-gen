    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. incisa, commonly known as the early potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features wiry stems and small, rounded leaves that are often finely toothed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover or rock garden plant."
