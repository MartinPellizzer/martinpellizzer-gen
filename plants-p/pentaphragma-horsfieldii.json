    "intro": "Pentaphragma horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's pentaphragma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Araliaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
