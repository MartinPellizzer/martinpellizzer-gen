    "intro": "Populus tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's poplar, is a species of willow family tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are typical of the Populus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
