    "intro": "Potentilla astracanica subsp. mollicrinis, commonly known as the soft-calyx potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, rose-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant features wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
