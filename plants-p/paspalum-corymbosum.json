    "intro": "Paspalum corymbosum, commonly known as Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Paspalum corymbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in moist habitats."
