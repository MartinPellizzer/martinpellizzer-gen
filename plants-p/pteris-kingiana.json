    "intro": "Pteris kingiana, commonly known as the king fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
