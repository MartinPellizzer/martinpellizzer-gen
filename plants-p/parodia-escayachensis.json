    "intro": "Parodia escayachensis, commonly known as the Escayache prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globose, ribbed stems that are often covered in white, fuzzy spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
