    "intro": "Pterocelastrus tricuspidatus, commonly known as the three-toothed boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is often used in hedge formations and as a specimen plant in landscaped areas."
