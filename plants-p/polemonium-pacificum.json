    "intro": "Polemonium pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its common name derives from its ladder-like arrangement of leaves and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
