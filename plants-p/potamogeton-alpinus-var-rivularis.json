    "intro": "Potamogeton alpinus var. rivularis, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich lakes and streams, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually found in clusters near the water surface. This variant is adapted to high-altitude and temperate regions, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
