    "intro": "Pycnanthus kombo var. kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon pygmy maple, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
