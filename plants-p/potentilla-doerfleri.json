    "intro": "Potentilla doerfleri, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla doerfleri is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in high-altitude ecosystems."
