    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. pumilum, commonly known as little millet, is a small annual grass native to warm temperate and subtropical regions. It produces slender, branching stems that grow close to the ground, typically reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant bears small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets that are usually pale green to golden in color. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine pubescence. It is often cultivated as a grain crop and is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
