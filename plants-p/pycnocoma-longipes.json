    "intro": "Pycnocoma longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed pycnocoma, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are yellow and arranged in a cluster, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
