    "intro": "Premna littoralis, commonly known as coastal premna, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and humid conditions. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, white or greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
