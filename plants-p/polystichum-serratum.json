    "intro": "Polystichum serratum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Polystichum serratum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery foliage."
