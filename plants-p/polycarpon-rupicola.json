    "intro": "Polycarpon rupicola, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor itself in crevices and access moisture from deep within the soil. Polycarpon rupicola is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems."
