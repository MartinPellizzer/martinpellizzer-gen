    "intro": "Pteris enderi, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable."
