    "intro": "Pandanus radiatus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense, brush-like inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its fruit, a fibrous husk enclosing a single seed, is used in local cuisines and for making thatch. Pandanus radiatus thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid environments."
