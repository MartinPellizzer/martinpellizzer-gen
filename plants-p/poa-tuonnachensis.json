    "intro": "Poa tuonnachensis, commonly known as the Scottish bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Scottish Highlands. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in Scotland."
