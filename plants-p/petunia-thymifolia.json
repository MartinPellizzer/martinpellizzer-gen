    "intro": "Petunia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved petunia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, thyme-scented leaves and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in a compact, bushy form, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its unique fragrance and ornamental value make it a popular choice among gardeners."
