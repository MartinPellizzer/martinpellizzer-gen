    "intro": "Polycycnis blancoi, commonly known as the Blanco's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a thick, fibrous layer of bark. Its leaves are large, pinnately compound, and can reach several meters in length. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
