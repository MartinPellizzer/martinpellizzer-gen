    "intro": "Peritoma serrulata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a variant of the sand verbena species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely serrated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its flowering pattern and foliage make it a distinctive species within the Tribulus genus. The white flowers are typically less showy than those of the typical form, but they still contribute to its ornamental value in dry landscapes."
