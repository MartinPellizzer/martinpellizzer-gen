    "intro": "Persea obscura, commonly known as the dark persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by yellow-orange fruits that are edible when fully ripe. Its bark is smooth and dark, often with a reddish tint, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Persea obscura is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
