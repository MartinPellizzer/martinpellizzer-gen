    "intro": "Polygonum convolvulaceum, commonly known as the creeping smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. Polygonum convolvulaceum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in wet meadows, where it thrives in moist to wet conditions."
