    "intro": "Polygonum persicaria var. opacum, commonly known as narrowleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early fall. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Polygonum persicaria."
