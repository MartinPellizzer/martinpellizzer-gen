    "intro": "Pinasgelon monnieri, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly across muddy or saturated soils. Pinasgelon monnieri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
