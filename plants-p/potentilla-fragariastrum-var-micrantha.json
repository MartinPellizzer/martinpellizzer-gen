    "intro": "Potentilla fragariastrum var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
