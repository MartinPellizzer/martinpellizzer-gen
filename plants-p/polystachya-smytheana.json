It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a rhizomatous structure and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous small, greenish-white flowers. Its botanical characteristics include lance-shaped leaves and a lack of true roots, with the stem serving as the primary photosynthetic organ. It is relatively rare and is often found in specific habitats, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
