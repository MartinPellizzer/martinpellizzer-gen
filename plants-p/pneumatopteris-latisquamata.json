    "intro": "Pneumatopteris latisquamata, commonly known as the broad-scale water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that are often used in horticultural settings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in both ecological and ornamental contexts."
