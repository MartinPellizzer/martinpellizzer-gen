    "intro": "Polystichum coriaceum var. callochlamys, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant features large, leathery, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive dark green color and a rough texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, architectural foliage."
