    "intro": "Phyteuma scorzonerifolium var. tenue, commonly known as narrow-leaved physostegia, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces tall, slender stems bearing clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
