It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and panicles of spikelets that produce abundant seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in pastures and disturbed areas. It is valued for forage but can become invasive in certain ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both useful and challenging in agricultural settings."
