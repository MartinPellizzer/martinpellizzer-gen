    "intro": "Petromarula strictiflora, commonly known as the rigid-flowered rock-milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Petromarula strictiflora plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
