    "intro": "Pteris dalhousieae, commonly known as the Dalhousie water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris dalhousieae is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
