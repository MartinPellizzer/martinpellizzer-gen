    "intro": "Pilularia natans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring inflated, bladder-like structures that help it float on the water's surface. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or just at the water's edge. Pilularia natans is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic insects and other prey."
