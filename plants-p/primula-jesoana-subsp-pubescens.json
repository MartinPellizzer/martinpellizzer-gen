    "intro": "Primula jesoana subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent primrose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, foliage, which gives it its subspecific name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
