    "intro": "Pandiaka angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandiaka, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
