    "intro": "Polygonatum pruinosum, commonly known as the slippery jenny, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy, sticky coating, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
