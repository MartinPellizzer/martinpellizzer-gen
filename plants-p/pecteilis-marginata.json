    "intro": "Pecteilis marginata, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often ribbed and have a peppery scent. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its roots are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine for their peppery flavor. Pecteilis marginata thrives in moist, aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
