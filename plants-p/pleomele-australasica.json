    "intro": "Pleomele australasica, commonly known as the Cook Islands cycad, is a flowering plant native to the Cook Islands and nearby Pacific islands. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female plants. It is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in humid, tropical climates. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
