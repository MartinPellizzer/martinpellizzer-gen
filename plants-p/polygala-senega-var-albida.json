    "intro": "Polygala senega var. albida, commonly known as the white senega or white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. This variety is distinguished by its lighter coloration compared to the more common var. senega."
