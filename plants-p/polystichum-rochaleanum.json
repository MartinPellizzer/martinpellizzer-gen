    "intro": "Polystichum rochaleanum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum rochaleanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
