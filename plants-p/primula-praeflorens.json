    "intro": "Primula praeflorens, commonly known as the early primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 15-30 cm, featuring basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring before many other plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soils. Primula praeflorens is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, where it contributes to the early floral display of the season."
