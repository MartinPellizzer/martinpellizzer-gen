    "intro": "Pinus hondoensis, commonly known as the Hondo pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hondo in the Philippines. It is a coniferous tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests at higher elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pinus hondoensis is considered a vulnerable species."
