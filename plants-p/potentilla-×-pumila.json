    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 pumila, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are typically prostrate or slightly ascending. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and vibrant floral display."
