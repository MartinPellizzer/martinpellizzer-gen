    "intro": "Pholidota celebica, commonly known as the Java tree or the Celebes tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. It is native to the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant has been studied for its potential medicinal properties due to the presence of bioactive compounds in its bark and leaves."
