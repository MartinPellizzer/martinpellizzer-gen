    "intro": "Piper parvicordulatum, commonly known as the small-leaf pepper or dwarf pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered green berries that turn red when mature, containing the aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in both horticulture and pharmacology."
