    "intro": "Primula erratica, commonly known as the wandering primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, white, or pink. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
