    "intro": "Pilosella macrotricha, commonly known as the woolly leaf mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Pilosella macrotricha is often found in moist to moderately dry soils and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with well-drained soil."
