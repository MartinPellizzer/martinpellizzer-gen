    "intro": "Passerina nivalis, commonly known as the snow pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its early spring blooming, with showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from cold temperatures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
