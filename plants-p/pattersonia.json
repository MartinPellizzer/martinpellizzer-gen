    "intro": "Pattersonia, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their unique, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They are typically found in rocky or sandy soils in coastal areas, often growing on cliffs or in heathlands. Pattersonia species are perennial herbs with slender stems and are known for their delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear in spring. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental changes."
