    "intro": "Potentilla tericholica, commonly known as the Tibetan cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cold and dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. Potentilla tericholica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
