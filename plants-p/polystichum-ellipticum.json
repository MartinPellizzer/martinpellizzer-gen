    "intro": "Polystichum ellipticum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in circular sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Polystichum ellipticum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
