    "intro": "Pilosella tephrodes, commonly known as the tephrodes hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish to white composite flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this perennial herb thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant's leaves are typically basal, with a rough, woolly texture, and its stems are often upright. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
