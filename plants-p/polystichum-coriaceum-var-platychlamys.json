    "intro": "Polystichum coriaceum var. platychlamys, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are broader than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a deep green color and a slightly curled, persistent rachis. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
