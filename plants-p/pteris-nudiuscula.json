    "intro": "Pteris nudiuscula, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris nudiuscula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
