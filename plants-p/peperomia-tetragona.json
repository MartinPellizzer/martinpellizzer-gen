    "intro": "Peperomia tetragona, commonly known as the Square-leaved Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a square or diamond pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or red, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for both novice and experienced plant enthusiasts."
