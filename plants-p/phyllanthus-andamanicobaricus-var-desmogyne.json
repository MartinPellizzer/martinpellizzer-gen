    "intro": "Phyllanthus andamanicobaricus var. desmogyne, commonly known as the Andaman sandpaper fig, is a shrub native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like texture on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are typically consumed raw. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
