    "intro": "Polybotrya acuminata, commonly known as the acuminated polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground or attach to surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
