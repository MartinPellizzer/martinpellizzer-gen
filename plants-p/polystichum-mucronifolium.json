    "intro": "Polystichum mucronifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features upright, branched fronds that are dark green and have a leathery texture. The fronds are characterized by their blunt-tipped, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, narrow, and gradually narrowing shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
