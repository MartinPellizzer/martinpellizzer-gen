It is characterized by its long, thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface or hang submerged. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high light exposure. Peschiera gracillima plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
