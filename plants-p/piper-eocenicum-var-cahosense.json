    "intro": "Piper eocenicum var. cahosense, commonly known as the Eocene pepper plant, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the humid lowland rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that mature to a dark purple color, containing aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its fossil record, providing insights into the evolution of the Piperaceae family during the Eocene epoch."
