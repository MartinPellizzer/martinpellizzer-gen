    "intro": "Polypodium pennigerum, commonly known as the rusty-backed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive rusty-colored underside. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its fronds are often divided into narrow segments. Polypodium pennigerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
