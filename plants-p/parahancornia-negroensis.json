    "intro": "Parahancornia negroensis, commonly known as the black nightshade cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a sprawling, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces striking, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, further adapting it to minimize water loss. Parahancornia negroensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas."
