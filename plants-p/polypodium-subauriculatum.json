    "intro": "Polypodium subauriculatum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-yellow bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. The golden polypody is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
