    "intro": "Plantago bracteata, commonly known as the bracted plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule, which aids in wind dispersal."
