    "intro": "Poa familiaris, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Poa familiaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and adaptability."
