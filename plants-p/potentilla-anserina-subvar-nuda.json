It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a mat-forming habit with slender, hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its subspecies nuda distinguishes itself by lacking the stipules found in the typical variety."
