    "intro": "Primula oculata, commonly known as the eye primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces distinctive, showy flower buds that resemble eyes, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
