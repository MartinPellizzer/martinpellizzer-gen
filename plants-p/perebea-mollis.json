    "intro": "Perebea mollis, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
