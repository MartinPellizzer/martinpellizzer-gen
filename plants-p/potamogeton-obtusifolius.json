    "intro": "Potamogeton obtusifolius, commonly known as broadleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe, Asia, and North America. It has long, flexible stems that often grow in dense mats along the bottom of lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are broad, oval, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss and provides buoyancy. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
