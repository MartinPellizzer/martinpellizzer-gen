    "intro": "Prosopis campestris var. elata, commonly known as the tall mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by long, slender pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper underground, contributing to its survival in desert ecosystems."
