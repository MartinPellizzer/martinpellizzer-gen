    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. corymbiferum, commonly known as the clustered holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, pointed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce upright, clustered fronds that give it a dense, compact appearance. The spores are released from small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
