    "intro": "Pyrus microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Pyrus microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture."
