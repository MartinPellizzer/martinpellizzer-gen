    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 vossii, commonly known as the Voss's twayblade, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant is characterized by its greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct yellowish-green lip, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Platanthera \u00d7 vossii thrives in moist, acidic soils within shaded, forested habitats, often near streams or in wetlands. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
