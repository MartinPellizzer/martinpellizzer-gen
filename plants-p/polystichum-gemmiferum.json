    "intro": "Polystichum gemmiferum, commonly known as the gemmiferous wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in clusters called sori. Polystichum gemmiferum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique ability to form gemmae, small vegetative propagules, allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
