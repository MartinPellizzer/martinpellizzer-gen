    "intro": "Pleurostima squamata, commonly known as the squamata mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered together. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
