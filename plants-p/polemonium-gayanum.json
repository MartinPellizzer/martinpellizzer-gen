    "intro": "Polemonium gayanum, commonly known as the Gaya bugleweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the Polemonium genus, which is part of the Boraginaceae family, known for its showy flowers and medicinal properties. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers in the summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
