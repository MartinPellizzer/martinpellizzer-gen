It typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters, featuring slender, branching stems with a smooth, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red drupes that are often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical, with a hairy underside, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
