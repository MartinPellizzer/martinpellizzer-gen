    "intro": "Pennisetum glabrum, commonly known as purple lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and striking purple to reddish plumes that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Pennisetum glabrum is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for pollinators and its low maintenance requirements."
