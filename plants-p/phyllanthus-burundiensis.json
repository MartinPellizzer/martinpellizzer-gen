    "intro": "Phyllanthus burundiensis, commonly known as Burundi spurge, is a shrub native to the highlands of Burundi. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
