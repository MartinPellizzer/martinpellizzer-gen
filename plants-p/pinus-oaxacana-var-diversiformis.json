    "intro": "Pinus oaxacana var. diversiformis, commonly known as the Oaxacan pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which includes both needles and scale-like leaves, a feature that sets it apart from most other pine species. The tree typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Its cones are small and often hang in clusters, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
