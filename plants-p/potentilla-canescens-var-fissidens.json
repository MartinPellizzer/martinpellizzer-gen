    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. fissidens, commonly known as the fissured potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
