    "intro": "Plantago stuckertii, commonly known as Stuckert's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
