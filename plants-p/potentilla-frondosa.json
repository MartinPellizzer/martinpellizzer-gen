    "intro": "Potentilla frondosa, commonly known as the alpine rose or shrub cinquefoil, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Potentilla frondosa thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
