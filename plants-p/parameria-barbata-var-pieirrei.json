    "intro": "Parameria barbata var. pieirrei, commonly known as the slender parameria, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
