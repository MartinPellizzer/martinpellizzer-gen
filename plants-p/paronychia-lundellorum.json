The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Paronychia lundellorum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
