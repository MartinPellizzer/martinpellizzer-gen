    "intro": "Pyrus pubescens, commonly known as the downy pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. Pyrus pubescens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
