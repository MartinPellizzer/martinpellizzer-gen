    "intro": "Primula sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky habitats. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
