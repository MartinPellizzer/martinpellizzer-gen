    "intro": "Pitcairnia latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and provide some protection against herbivores. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
