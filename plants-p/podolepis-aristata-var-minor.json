    "intro": "Podolepis aristata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser star-of-Bahia, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
