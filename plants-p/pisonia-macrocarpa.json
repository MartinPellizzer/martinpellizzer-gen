    "intro": "Pisonia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals after ripening. Pisonia macrocarpa is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
