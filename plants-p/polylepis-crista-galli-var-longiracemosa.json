    "intro": "Polylepis crista-galli var. longiracemosa, commonly known as the Andean mountain pine, is a variant of the Polylepis genus native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated inflorescences and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
