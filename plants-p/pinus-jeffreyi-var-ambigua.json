    "intro": "Pinus jeffreyi var. ambigua, commonly known as the Jeffrey pine, is a variant of the Jeffrey pine native to the western United States. It is a tall, straight-growing conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical Jeffrey pine. The cones of this variety are often larger and more elongated, and they release their seeds in response to fire. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is well adapted to rocky soils. The plant plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is valued for its timber and ecological significance."
