    "intro": "Peucedanum altum, commonly known as greater cowparsley, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse easily by wind. Peucedanum altum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
