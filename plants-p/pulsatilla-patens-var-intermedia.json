    "intro": "Pulsatilla patens var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage consists of palmately divided leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. This species is notable for its early spring blooming and its role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
