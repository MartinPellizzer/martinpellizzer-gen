It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a potential indicator of soil moisture conditions."
