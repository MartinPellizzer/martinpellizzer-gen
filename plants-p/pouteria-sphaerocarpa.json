    "intro": "Pouteria sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the \"spherocarpa\" or \"candlenut tree,\" is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single, hard-shelled seed. Its fruit is valued for its high oil content, which is used in both culinary and industrial applications. The tree also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
