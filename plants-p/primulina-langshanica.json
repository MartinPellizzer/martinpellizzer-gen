    "intro": "Primulina langshanica, commonly known as the Langshan violet, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
