It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by long, flat pods containing dark brown seeds. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
