It has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters near the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. Potamogeton acutifolius is often found in slow-moving waters such as lakes, ponds, and marshes."
