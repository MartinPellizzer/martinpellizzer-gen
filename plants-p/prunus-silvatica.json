    "intro": "Prunus silvatica, commonly known as the wild cherry or black cherry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters with a broad, rounded crown and smooth, dark bark. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that ripen to a dark red or black color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Prunus silvatica is valued for its timber, ornamental qualities, and role in supporting local wildlife."
