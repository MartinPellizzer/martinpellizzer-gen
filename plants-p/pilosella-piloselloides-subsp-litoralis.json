    "intro": "Pilosella piloselloides subsp. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant features small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are usually hairy and narrow. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in maritime environments and is considered a rare or endemic species in certain areas."
