It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warm season, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are typically spineless and serve as a means of photosynthesis. It requires minimal water and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in xerophytic gardens."
