    "intro": "Pleurothallis macropus, commonly known as the large-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a racemose inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it is not widely commercialized."
