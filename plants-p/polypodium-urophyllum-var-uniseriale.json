    "intro": "Polypodium urophyllum var. uniseriale, commonly known as the single-row wall fern, is a variant of the common wall fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique foliage pattern, with a single row of sporangia, distinguishes it from other polypodium species."
