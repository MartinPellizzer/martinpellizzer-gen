    "intro": "Pinus ustulata, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a species of conifer native to the high elevations of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The tree produces cones that release seeds in the fall, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically blue-green in color and grow in bundles of five, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pinus ustulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
