It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate, and often translucent leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flower with a distinctive white and green coloration, which blooms during the wet season. Platystele aianthera is known for its unique morphology, including its specialized roots that absorb moisture from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
