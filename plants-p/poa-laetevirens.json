    "intro": "Poa laetevirens, commonly known as the cheerful green bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bright green foliage that remains vibrant throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, Poa laetevirens is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
