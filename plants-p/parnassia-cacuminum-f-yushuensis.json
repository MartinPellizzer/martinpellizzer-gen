    "intro": "Parnassia cacuminum f. yushuensis, commonly known as the Yushu parnassia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers with a yellow center. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
