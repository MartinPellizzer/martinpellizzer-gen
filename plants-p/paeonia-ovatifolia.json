    "intro": "Paeonia ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf peony, is a deciduous perennial plant native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring. The plant features compound, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes, which store nutrients and help the plant survive winter. Paeonia ovatifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
