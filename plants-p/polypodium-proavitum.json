    "intro": "Polypodium proavitum, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized indusium. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polypodium proavitum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
