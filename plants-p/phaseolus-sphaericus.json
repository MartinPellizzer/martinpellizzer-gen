    "intro": "Phaseolus sphaericus, commonly known as the spherical bean, is a unique species within the legume family. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical or nearly globular pods, which are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. The plant is native to Central America and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Its small, edible seeds are often used in local cuisines, though it is not as widely cultivated as other beans. Due to its unusual morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
