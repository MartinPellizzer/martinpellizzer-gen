    "intro": "Pulsatilla cernua f. flava, commonly known as the yellow pasqueflower, is a variant of the pasqueflower species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, nodding yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of down. The yellow form of this species is distinguished by its more intensely colored flowers compared to the typical white or pink varieties."
