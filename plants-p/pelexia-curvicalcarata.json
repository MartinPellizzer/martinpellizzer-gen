    "intro": "Pelexia curvicalcarata, commonly known as the curled calyx pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted calyx that resembles a spiral staircase, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
