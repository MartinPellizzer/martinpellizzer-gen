    "intro": "Phlox albomarginata subsp. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features showy, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair, which helps reflect excess sunlight. Its flowers are usually pink to lavender in color, with distinct white margins that give it its common name. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
