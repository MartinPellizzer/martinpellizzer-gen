    "intro": "Populus deltoides var. virginiana, commonly known as the American poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, triangular leaves that are often fuzzy beneath, and its distinctive, pendulous catkins that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in floodplain forests. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
