    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. arachnoideum, commonly known as the hairy bracken, is a variant of the bracken fern native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its spread through wind dispersal. This fern is an important component of many ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
