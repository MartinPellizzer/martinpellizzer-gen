    "intro": "Phalaenopsis alboviolacea, commonly known as the violet-tinged orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting flowers that typically display a combination of white and purple hues. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically light green in color. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Phalaenopsis alboviolacea is popular in horticulture for its beauty and ease of care."
