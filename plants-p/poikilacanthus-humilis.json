    "intro": "Poikilacanthus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf star cactus, is a low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, sprawling structure with multiple stems that branch out from a central base. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Poikilacanthus humilis is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
