It features rosettes of glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters at the center of the rosette, which are followed by fluffy, spherical seed heads. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
