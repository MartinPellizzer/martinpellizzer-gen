    "intro": "Pilosella schultesii subsp. acariaea, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
