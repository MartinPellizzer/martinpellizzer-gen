    "intro": "Psychotria aegialodes, commonly known as the beach psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species with medicinal and ornamental value. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, adapting to salty and wind-exposed environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in association with other coastal flora in tropical and subtropical regions."
