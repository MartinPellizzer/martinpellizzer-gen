    "intro": "Psoralea holubii, commonly known as Holub's psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats, often in coastal or inland areas. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
