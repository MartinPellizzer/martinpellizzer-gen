    "intro": "Phelypaea coelestis, commonly known as the sky fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features feathery, light green fronds that are typically arching and graceful in appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phelypaea coelestis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
