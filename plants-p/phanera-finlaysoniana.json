    "intro": "Phanera finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's phanera, is a rare flowering plant native to the limestone hills of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
