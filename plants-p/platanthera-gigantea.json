    "intro": "Platanthera gigantea, commonly known as the giant lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, three-rowed flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
