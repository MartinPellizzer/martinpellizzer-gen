    "intro": "Panicum rugulosum var. glabrescens, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured leaves and panicle-like inflorescences that produce small, pale green to golden florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It is a perennial species that can form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife. Its ornamental value has led to its use in wetland restoration projects and as a landscape plant in water-retentive gardens."
