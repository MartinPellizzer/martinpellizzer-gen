    "intro": "Peperomia tungurahuae, commonly known as the Tungurahua peperomia, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features small, ovate leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
