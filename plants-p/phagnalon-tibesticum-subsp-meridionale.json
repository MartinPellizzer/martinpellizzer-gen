    "intro": "Phagnalon tibesticum subsp. meridionale, commonly known as the southern phagnalon, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Tibet, where it thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its narrow, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads. It is adapted to cold, arid conditions and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
