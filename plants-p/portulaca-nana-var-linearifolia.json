    "intro": "Portulaca nana var. linearifolia, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca or mossy portulaca, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features tiny, fleshy leaves that are linear and slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover."
