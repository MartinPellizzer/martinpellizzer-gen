    "intro": "Platanthera azorica, commonly known as the Azorean lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its unique, fragrant inflorescence composed of long, slender flowers that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests and along stream banks. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
