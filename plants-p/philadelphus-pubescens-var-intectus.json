It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden cultivation.
