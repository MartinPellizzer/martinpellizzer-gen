    "intro": "Psacalium peltatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds. Psacalium peltatum is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies due to its preference for moist, rich soils."
