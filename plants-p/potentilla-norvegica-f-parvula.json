    "intro": "Potentilla norvegica f. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to northern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
