    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. firmula, commonly known as the firm-leaf wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the top. It is often found in association with other woodland flora and is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect and bird life."
