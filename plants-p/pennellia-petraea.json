    "intro": "Pennellia petraea, commonly known as the rock pennywort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to rocky and coastal environments. It typically grows in crevices and on rocky substrates, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, clustered in small umbels, and bloom in early summer. Pennellia petraea is often found in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe."
