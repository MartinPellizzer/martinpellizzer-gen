    "intro": "Polyodon texanus, commonly known as the Texas polyodon, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and along stream banks. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
