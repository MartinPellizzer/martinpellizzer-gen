    "intro": "Polygala usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the East African highlands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas and is adapted to the region's cool, humid climate. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
