    "intro": "Picea numidica, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, round cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta."
