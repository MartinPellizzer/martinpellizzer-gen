    "intro": "Pomphidea, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Asia and North America. The plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. They typically grow in woodland or rocky habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal. However, many species are toxic and should be handled with care."
