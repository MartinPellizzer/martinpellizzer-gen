    "intro": "Pentacme siamensis, commonly known as the Siam pentacme, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, Pentacme siamensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat."
