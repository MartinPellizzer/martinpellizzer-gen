    "intro": "Psydrax attenuatus, commonly known as the slender psidium, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
