    "intro": "Pelexia subaequalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pelexia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Pelexia subaequalis is native to regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It is generally a short-lived perennial and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
