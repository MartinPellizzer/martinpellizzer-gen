    "intro": "Phyteuma pyrenaicum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-flowered phyteuma, is a subspecies of the phyteuma plant native to the Pyrenees region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, short hairs, though the 'glabrescens' form is notably smoother than the typical variety. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
