    "intro": "Paronychia herniaria, commonly known as sticky Wilford, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps deter herbivores. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its unique appearance and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a notable species in its native habitat."
