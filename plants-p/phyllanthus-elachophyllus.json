It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, red to orange fruits that are about 5 to 8 millimeters in diameter. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
