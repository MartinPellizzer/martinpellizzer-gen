    "intro": "Prunus spinosa subvar. platypetala, commonly known as the flat-petaled blackthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and the plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. This subvariety is distinguished by its flattened petals, which set it apart from other Prunus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
