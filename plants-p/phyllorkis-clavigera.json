    "intro": "Phyllorkis clavigera, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized species."
