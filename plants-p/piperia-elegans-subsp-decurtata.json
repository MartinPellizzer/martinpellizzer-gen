    "intro": "Piperia elegans subsp. decurtata, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and wetlands. Its flowers are arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence and are often pollinated by flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
