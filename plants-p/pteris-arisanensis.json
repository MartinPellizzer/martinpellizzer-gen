    "intro": "Pteris arisanensis, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris arisanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
