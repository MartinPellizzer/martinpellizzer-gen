    "intro": "Pneumatopteris hudsoniana, commonly known as the Hudson's fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pneumatopteris hudsoniana is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
