    "intro": "Poa pfisteri, commonly known as the Pfister's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa pfisteri is considered a rare and endangered species."
