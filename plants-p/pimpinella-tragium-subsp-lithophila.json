    "intro": "Pimpinella tragium subsp. lithophila, commonly known as the Lithophytic Cuckoo's Beak, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows on limestone soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, alkaline conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its specialized ecological requirements and limited distribution."
