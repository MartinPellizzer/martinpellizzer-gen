    "intro": "Potamogeton fragillimus, commonly known as the fragile pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has slender, grass-like stems that are often branched and bear small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typically found near the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its delicate structure, it is often difficult to distinguish from other pondweeds without close examination."
