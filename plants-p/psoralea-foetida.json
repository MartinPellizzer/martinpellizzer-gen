It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes referred to as the \"smelly\" or \"stinky\" plant."
