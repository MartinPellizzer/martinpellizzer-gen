    "intro": "Poa neglecta, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa neglecta is noted for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
