    "intro": "Pecteilis leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf pecteilis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
