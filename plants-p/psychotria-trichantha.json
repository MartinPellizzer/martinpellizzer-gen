    "intro": "Psychotria trichantha, commonly known as the \"Coca plant\" in some regions, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is notable for containing alkaloids, particularly cocaine, which is found in its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is both economically and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
