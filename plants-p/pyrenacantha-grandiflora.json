    "intro": "Pyrenacantha grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered pyrenacantha, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, which provide habitat for various small animals. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires full sun and moderate watering."
