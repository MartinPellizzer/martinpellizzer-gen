    "intro": "Planchonella kingiana var. andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andaman Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in coastal areas, often forming dense thickets in brackish or saline soils. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
