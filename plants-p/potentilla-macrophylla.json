    "intro": "Potentilla macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and long-lasting blooms."
