    "intro": "Poa curvula, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa curvula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
