    "intro": "Pseudoweinmannia lachnocarpa, commonly known as the sticky false weinmannia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces unique, glandular structures that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on insect pollination. The species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use."
