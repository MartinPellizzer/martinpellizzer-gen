    "intro": "Pseudalbizzia subdimidiata var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. Its woody structure and dense foliage make it a hardy species adapted to dry, well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
