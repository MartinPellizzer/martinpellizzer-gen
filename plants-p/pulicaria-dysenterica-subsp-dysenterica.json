    "intro": "Pulicaria dysenterica subsp. dysenterica, commonly known as the dysenteric groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically noted for their potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
