    "intro": "Polypodium vacciniifolium f. incisofimbriata, commonly known as the incised-fringed polypody, is a fern species characterized by its finely divided, lobed leaves. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive incised margin with finely toothed edges. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to humid, low-light conditions typical of its natural habitat."
