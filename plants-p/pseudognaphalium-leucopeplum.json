    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium leucopeplum, commonly known as the silverleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
