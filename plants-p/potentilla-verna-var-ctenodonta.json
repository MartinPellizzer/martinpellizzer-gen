    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. ctenodonta, commonly known as the early potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open meadows. This variety is notable for its early flowering habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
