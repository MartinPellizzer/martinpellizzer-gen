    "intro": "Potentilla glacialis, commonly known as glacier cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has delicate, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Potentilla glacialis plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
