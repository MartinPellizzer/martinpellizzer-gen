    "intro": "Phoradendron meliae, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Phoradendron, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to the Americas, particularly in regions of Central and South America. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds, which also feed on the fruit. Its leaves are alternate and scale-like, and it lacks true roots, relying on its host for water and nutrients. The plant plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
