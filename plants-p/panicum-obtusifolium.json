    "intro": "Panicum obtusifolium, commonly known as broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically tinged with red or purple at maturity. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Its adaptability and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
