    "intro": "Phyllobolus pallens, commonly known as the pale leaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish body and elongated, oval shape. The beetle's larvae feed on the leaves of various plants, particularly those in the family Polygonaceae. Adults are often found on the undersides of leaves, where they lay their eggs. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by contributing to the decomposition of plant material."
