    "intro": "Phymatodes longisquamata, commonly known as the longscale phymatode, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, aromatic odor. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder, which helps in reducing water loss. Phymatodes longisquamata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
