    "intro": "Prunus americana, commonly known as the American cherry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 feet, featuring a rounded canopy and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red cherries that ripen in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in woodland and open areas."
