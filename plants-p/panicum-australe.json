    "intro": "Panicum australe, commonly known as Australian ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce abundant seeds. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Panicum australe is often used in ecological restoration due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
