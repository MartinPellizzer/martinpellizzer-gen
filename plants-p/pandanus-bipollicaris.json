    "intro": "Pandanus bipollicaris, commonly known as the double-fruited pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the Pandanaceae family. It is native to the Pacific Islands and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into distinctive, spiky fruits. It thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing near mangroves or in brackish water. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
