    "intro": "Prevostea mortehanii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or rocky outcrops. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
