It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear whorled leaves, which are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue. Its showy flowers, which range from pink to violet, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
