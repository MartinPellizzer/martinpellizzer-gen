    "intro": "Packera dimorphophylla var. dimorphophylla, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Due to its limited range and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
