It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid conditions. It prefers bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
