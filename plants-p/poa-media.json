    "intro": "Poa media, commonly known as blue grass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thick mats. Poa media is often used in lawns and as a ground cover due to its durability and aesthetic appeal."
