    "intro": "Phleum pratense f. alpinoides, commonly known as alpine timothy grass, is a botanical variant of timothy grass native to alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more densely packed leaves compared to the typical form. This subspecies thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments, often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems are usually shorter and more upright, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in mountainous areas."
