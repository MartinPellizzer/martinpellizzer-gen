    "intro": "Pouteria flavilatex, commonly known as the yellow latex tree, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree is notable for its milky, yellow latex sap, which is released when the bark or leaves are damaged. This latex has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive and for medicinal applications. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
