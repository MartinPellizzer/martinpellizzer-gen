    "intro": "Piptomeris rhadinoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. The plant is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
