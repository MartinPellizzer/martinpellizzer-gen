    "intro": "Paphiopedilum appletonianum var. tridentatum, commonly known as the Tridentate Lady's Slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, velvety petals and a unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, upright stem and broad, dark green leaves. It blooms with showy flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a contrasting yellow or orange lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
