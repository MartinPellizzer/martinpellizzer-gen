    "intro": "Ptilotus depressus, commonly known as the flat burr bush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring grey-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, followed by distinctive, spherical seed pods that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in low-nutrient soils and high temperatures. Ptilotus depressus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
