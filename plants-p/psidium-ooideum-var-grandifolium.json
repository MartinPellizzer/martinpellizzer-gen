It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fragrant fruits similar to common guavas. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production."
