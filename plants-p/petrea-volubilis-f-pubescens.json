    "intro": "Petrea volubilis f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy petrea, is a vigorous, climbing shrub native to South America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and floral display."
