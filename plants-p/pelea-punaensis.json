    "intro": "Pelea punaensis, commonly known as the Andean pelea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of the Andean altiplano. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pelea punaensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect species."
