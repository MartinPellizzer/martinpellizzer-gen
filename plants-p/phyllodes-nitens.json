    "intro": "Phyllodes nitens, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a species of acacia native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, compound leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves, though they are actually modified stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The plant is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also important in ecological restoration projects."
