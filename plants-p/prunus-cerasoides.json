    "intro": "Prunus cerasoides, commonly known as the Kashmir cherry or rock cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that are yellow or red when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Prunus cerasoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
