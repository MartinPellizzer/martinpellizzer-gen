    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. erecta, commonly known as the upright cherry, is a compact, bushy form of the Prunus lannesiana species. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more sprawling forms of its parent species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically pink or white, followed by edible berries in summer. Its foliage is dense and provides good cover, making it suitable for ornamental purposes in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
