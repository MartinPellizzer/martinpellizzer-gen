It is characterized by its spiny, compound leaves and pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a useful species in ecological restoration projects."
