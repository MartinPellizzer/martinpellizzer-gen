It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with narrow petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its flowers bloom in spring. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
