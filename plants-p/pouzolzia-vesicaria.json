    "intro": "Pouzolzia vesicaria, commonly known as the bladderleaf pouzolzia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Pouzolzia vesicaria is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
