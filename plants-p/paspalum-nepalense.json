    "intro": "Paspalum nepalense, commonly known as Nepal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Paspalum nepalense is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various wildlife species."
