    "intro": "Paspalum dissitiflorum, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue. Paspalum dissitiflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
