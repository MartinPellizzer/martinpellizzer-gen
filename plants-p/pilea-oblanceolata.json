    "intro": "Pilea oblanceolata, commonly known as the Shangri-La plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is a popular indoor plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. Pilea oblanceolata thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers moist, well-draining soil."
