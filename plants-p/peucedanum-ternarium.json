    "intro": "Peucedanum ternarium, commonly known as three-lobed hogweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, so caution is advised when handling or consuming it."
