    "intro": "Pyrrosia mollis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, leathery fronds that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Pyrrosia mollis is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
