It is a perennial grass characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and grassland ecosystems. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Plectrachne rigidissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological adaptability."
