    "intro": "Plocama crocyllis, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a small shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found along stream banks and in riparian habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Plocama crocyllis is a valued plant in native plant gardens due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
