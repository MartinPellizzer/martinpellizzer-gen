    "intro": "Primula edelbergii, commonly known as the Edelberg's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.
