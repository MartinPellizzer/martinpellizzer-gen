    "intro": "Pterostylis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a single, erect stem with a single spike of small, greenish-brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
