    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. domestica, commonly known as the common meadowgrass, is a variant of the tall fescue species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in lawns, meadows, and pastures, thriving in well-drained soils. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to form dense turf, making it a popular choice for turfgrass applications. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to withstand moderate foot traffic."
