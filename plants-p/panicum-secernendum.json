    "intro": "Panicum secernendum, commonly known as the silver panicum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common ornamental and forage grass. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it useful in erosion control and landscaping."
