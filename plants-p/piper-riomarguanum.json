    "intro": "Piper riomarguanum, commonly known as the Riomarguanum pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit."
