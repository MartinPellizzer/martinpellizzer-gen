    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea proles arenicola, commonly known as the sandy cinerea potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, dense hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a hardy species well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
