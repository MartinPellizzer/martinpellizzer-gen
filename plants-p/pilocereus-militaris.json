    "intro": "Pilocereus militaris, commonly known as the military night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal flowering habit."
