    "intro": "Potentilla stolonifera, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features spreading stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Potentilla stolonifera is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
