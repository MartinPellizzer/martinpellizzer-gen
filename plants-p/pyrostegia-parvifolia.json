    "intro": "Pyrostegia parvifolia, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red or orange berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in some areas."
