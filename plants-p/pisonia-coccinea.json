    "intro": "Pisonia coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet pisonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from red to orange, which are adapted to attract birds for pollination. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia coccinea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates."
