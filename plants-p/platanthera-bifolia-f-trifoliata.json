    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to moist, shaded forest environments. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves, which are a key feature of the 'trifoliata' form. The plant produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
