    "intro": "Praepilosocereus mortensenii, commonly known as the Mortensen's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
