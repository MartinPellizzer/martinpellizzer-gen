It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and streams. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
