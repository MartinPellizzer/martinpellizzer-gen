    "intro": "Priestleya calycina, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. Its unique structure includes a slender, erect stem with few leaves and a cluster of elongated, spathaceous bracts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
