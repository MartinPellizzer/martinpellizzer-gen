It features silver-gray, woolly foliage that reflects sunlight, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
