    "intro": "Polypodium firmulum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with numerous fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium firmulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings."
