    "intro": "Panicum kleinianum, commonly known as Klein's panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Panicum kleinianum is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
