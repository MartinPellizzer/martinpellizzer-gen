    "intro": "Papaver triniifolium, commonly known as the three-leaved poppy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, papery petals that range in color from pink to red, and its three-lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a triangular pattern. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
