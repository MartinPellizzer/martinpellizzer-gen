    "intro": "Papaver angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, often red or orange, flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
