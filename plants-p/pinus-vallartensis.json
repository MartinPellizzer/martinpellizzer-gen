    "intro": "Pinus vallartensis, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically red or purple in color, which release seeds when mature. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes."
