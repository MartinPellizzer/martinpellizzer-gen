    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. uniflora, commonly known as narrowleaf common reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. This variant is often found in marshes, shallow lakes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form extensive colonies, stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. The plant plays a crucial role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and preventing erosion."
