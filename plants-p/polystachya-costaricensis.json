It is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
