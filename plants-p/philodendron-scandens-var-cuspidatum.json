    "intro": "Philodendron scandens var. cuspidatum, commonly known as the curly goosefoot, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
