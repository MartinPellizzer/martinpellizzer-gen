    "intro": "Pilea montana, commonly known as the African Violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often velvety and dark green. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom from the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea montana is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
