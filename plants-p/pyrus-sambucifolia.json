    "intro": "Pyrus sambucifolia, commonly known as the sambucifolia pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of the European elderberry, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
