    "intro": "Psittacanthus crassifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The species is considered ancient, with a lineage dating back to the Mesozoic era."
