    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. pycnotricha, commonly known as the hairy potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features wiry, branched stems covered in dense, white to grayish pubescence. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
