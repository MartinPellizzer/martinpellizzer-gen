    "intro": "Pilea monilifera, commonly known as the friendship plant or Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that resemble small, round coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea monilifera is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
