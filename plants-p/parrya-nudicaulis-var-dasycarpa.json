    "intro": "Parrya nudicaulis var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy fruit parrya, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, glandular leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by the unique, hairy, berry-like fruits that give it its common name. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
