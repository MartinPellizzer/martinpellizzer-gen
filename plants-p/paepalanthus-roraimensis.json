    "intro": "Paepalanthus roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima poinsettia, is a unique plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble those of the poinsettia, though it is not closely related. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in areas with limited nutrients. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, contrasting with the showy foliage. Paepalanthus roraimensis is adapted to the harsh conditions of the tepui environment, showcasing remarkable resilience and evolutionary specialization."
