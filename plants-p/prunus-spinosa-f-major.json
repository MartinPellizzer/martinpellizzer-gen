    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. major, commonly known as the large-fruited blackthorn, is a cultivar of the blackthorn plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its robust growth and larger, more flavorful berries compared to the typical blackthorn. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are often used in culinary applications, such as making jams and liqueurs. Its thorny stems and dense foliage make it a useful shrub for hedging or ornamental purposes. The flowers are small, white, and appear in early spring before the leaves."
