    "intro": "Panax ginseng f. angustatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved ginseng, is a rare variant of the ginseng plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the typical ginseng species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red berries, which are typical of the Araliaceae family. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable and endangered plant in traditional medicine."
