    "intro": "Potentilla subviscosa var. ramulosa, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically features slender, wiry stems covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with a fine pubescence, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This variety is often found in moist, rocky soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
