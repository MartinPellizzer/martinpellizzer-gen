    "intro": "Pygeum latifolium f. genuinum, commonly known as the broadleaf African teak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the African teak tree. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in southern and eastern parts. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
