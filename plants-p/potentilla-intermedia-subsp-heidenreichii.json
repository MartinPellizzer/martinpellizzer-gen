    "intro": "Potentilla intermedia subsp. heidenreichii, commonly known as the Alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, upright stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, rocky environments."
