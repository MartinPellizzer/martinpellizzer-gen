    "intro": "Poa caesia var. strictior, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically forms dense turf-like mats, making it a valuable groundcover in dry, rocky habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions."
