    "intro": "Prasophyllum striatum, commonly known as the stripe leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall flowering stems with clusters of greenish-white or pale pink flowers. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
