    "intro": "Primula shihmienensis, commonly known as the Shihmen primrose, is a flowering plant native to China, specifically found in the Shihmen region of Taiwan. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing pink to white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
