    "intro": "Psyllium exiguum, commonly known as the narrowleaf psyllium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces lightweight, wind-dispersed seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and as a dietary fiber supplement. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Psyllium exiguum is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for cultivation in drought-prone regions."
