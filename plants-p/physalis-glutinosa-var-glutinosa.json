    "intro": "Physalis glutinosa var. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky purslane or sticky nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves covered in a sticky, glandular coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its sticky foliage, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
