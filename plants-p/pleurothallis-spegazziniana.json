    "intro": "Pleurothallis spegazziniana, commonly known as the Spegazzini's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
