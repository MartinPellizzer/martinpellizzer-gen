    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. tricolor, commonly known as the tricolor pine, is a rare and striking variant of the Spanish pine. It is characterized by its distinctive three-color foliage, with needles displaying a combination of green, blue, and silver tones. This variation is due to genetic factors that affect chlorophyll and carotenoid pigmentation. The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique appearance makes it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
