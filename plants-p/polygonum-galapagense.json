    "intro": "Polygonum galapagense, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or red, during the wet season. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the islands. Due to its restricted range and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
