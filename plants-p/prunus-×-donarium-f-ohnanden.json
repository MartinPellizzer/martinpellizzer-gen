    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 donarium f. ohnanden, commonly known as the Japanese apricot or *Prunus* 'Ohnanen', is a compact, ornamental shrub prized for its showy flowers. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is a hybrid between *Prunus mume* and *Prunus lusitanica*. The plant produces fragrant, white or pink flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the blossoms. It is well-suited for small gardens and containers due to its dwarf growth habit."
