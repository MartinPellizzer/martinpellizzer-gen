    "intro": "Ptelea formosa, commonly known as the fragrant sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like the poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a fragrant aroma when crushed. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by orange-red berries that ripen in the fall. Ptelea formosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
