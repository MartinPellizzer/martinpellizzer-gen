    "intro": "Papaver tenerifae, commonly known as the Canary Islands poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a prominent, bulbous seed capsule. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
