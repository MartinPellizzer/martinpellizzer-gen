    "intro": "Penstemon imberbis, commonly known as the hairless beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon imberbis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
