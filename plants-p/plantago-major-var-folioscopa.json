    "intro": "Plantago major var. folioscopa, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical Plantago major."
