    "intro": "Peliosanthes retroflexa, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood. It is a small evergreen tree native to southern China, characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
