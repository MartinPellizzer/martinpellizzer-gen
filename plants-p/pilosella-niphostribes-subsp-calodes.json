    "intro": "Pilosella niphostribes subsp. calodes, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
