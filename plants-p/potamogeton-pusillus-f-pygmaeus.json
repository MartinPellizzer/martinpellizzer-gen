It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has slender, branching stems with small, oval leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its delicate appearance and slow growth make it a characteristic species in pond and lake environments."
