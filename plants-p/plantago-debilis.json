    "intro": "Plantago debilis, commonly known as slender plantain, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and healing properties."
