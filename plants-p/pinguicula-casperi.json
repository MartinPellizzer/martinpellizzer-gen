    "intro": "Pinguicula casperi, commonly known as the Casperi's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
