    "intro": "Polypodium diversifolium, commonly known as the rock fern or the common rock cap, is a species of fern found in temperate regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often covered in a dense, hairy layer. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces, including cliffs and walls, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in its habitat. The leaves are usually dark green and can vary in shape, contributing to its adaptability in different environments."
