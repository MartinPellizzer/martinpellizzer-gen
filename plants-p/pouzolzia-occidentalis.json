    "intro": "Pouzolzia occidentalis, commonly known as western pouzolzia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Pouzolzia occidentalis is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny habitats with minimal water availability."
