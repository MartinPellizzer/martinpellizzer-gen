    "intro": "Pinus mugo subsp. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog pine, is a subspecies of the mountain pine native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It is a small, shrub-like conifer that typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often in peat bogs or heathlands. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, forming dense, low-growing clumps. Its needles are dark green and remain on the plant for several years before shedding. The cones are small and typically open to release their seeds, contributing to its role in forest succession and ecological stability."
