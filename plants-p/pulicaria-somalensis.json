    "intro": "Pulicaria somalensis, commonly known as Somali groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with woolly, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Pulicaria somalensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
