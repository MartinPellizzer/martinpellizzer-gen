It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
