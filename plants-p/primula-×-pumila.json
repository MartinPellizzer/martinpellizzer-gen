    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 pumila, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, aiding in moisture retention. Primula \u00d7 pumila thrives in cool, shady environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
