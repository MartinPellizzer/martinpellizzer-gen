    "intro": "Polypogon \u00d7 littoralis var. hiegegaweri, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and periodic flooding. Its resilience makes it an important component of coastal dune ecosystems."
