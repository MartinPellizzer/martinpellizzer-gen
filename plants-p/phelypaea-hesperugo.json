    "intro": "Phelypaea hesperugo, commonly known as the western shield fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Phelypaea hesperugo plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
