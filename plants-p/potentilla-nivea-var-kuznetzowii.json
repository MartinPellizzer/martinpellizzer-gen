    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. kuznetzowii, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or silver hair, giving it a frosty appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arctic and alpine environments."
