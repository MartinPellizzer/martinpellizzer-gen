    "intro": "Penstemon saxosorum, commonly known as the rock penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces striking blue to violet tubular flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Penstemon saxosorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
