    "intro": "Polypodium phyllitidis var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated water fern, is a variant of the polypody fern found in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across rocky or soil surfaces. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. This variety is often found in temperate regions, thriving in humid, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks."
