    "intro": "Platanthera yakumontana, commonly known as Yakumontan Lady's Tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and long, spirally arranged inflorescences that bear small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. It is a perennial herb with a short rhizome and is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
