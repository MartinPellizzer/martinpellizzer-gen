    "intro": "Plantago radicata subsp. acanthophylla, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which are typically arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
