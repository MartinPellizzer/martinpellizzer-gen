    "intro": "Plantago armeriifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties."
