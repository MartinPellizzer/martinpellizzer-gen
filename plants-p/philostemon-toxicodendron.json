    "intro": "Philostemon toxicodendron, commonly known as the poisonwood plant, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It contains toxic compounds, particularly in its leaves and bark, which can cause skin irritation and other adverse reactions in humans. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and landscaping."
