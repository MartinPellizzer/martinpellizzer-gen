    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus pulcher var. squamata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
