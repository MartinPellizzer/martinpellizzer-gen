    "intro": "Pachira fastuosa, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendant clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets, and its trunk is often swollen at the base. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pachira fastuosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade in outdoor spaces."
