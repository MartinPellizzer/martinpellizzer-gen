    "intro": "Parrya fruticulosa, commonly known as the Sierra dwarf mallow, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions. Its flowering period attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Parrya fruticulosa is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
