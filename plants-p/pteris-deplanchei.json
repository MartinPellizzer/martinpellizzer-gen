    "intro": "Pteris deplanchei, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in its identification."
