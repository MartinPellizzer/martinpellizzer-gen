    "intro": "Persea edulis, commonly known as the avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It produces a large, pear-shaped fruit with a smooth, thin skin that encases a creamy, nutrient-rich pulp. The fruit's pericarp contains a single large seed, and the leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires a long growing season. It is widely cultivated for its edible fruit, which is valued for its high monounsaturated fat content."
