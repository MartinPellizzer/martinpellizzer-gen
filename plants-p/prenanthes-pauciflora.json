    "intro": "Prenanthes pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered water hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its root system is toxic and contains compounds similar to those found in poison hemlock. Due to its toxic nature, it is often avoided by both livestock and humans."
