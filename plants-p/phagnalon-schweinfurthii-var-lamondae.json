It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal in dry garden settings."
