    "intro": "Parodia spegazziniana var. spanisa, commonly known as the Spanish moon cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a single, large areole bearing white or pale yellow spines. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its foliage is usually reduced to a few small, paddle-shaped leaves at the base. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
