    "intro": "Pedicularis gyroflexa var. praetutiana, commonly known as the Alpine Lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its tubular, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in mountainous areas of Austria, Switzerland, and Italy. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
