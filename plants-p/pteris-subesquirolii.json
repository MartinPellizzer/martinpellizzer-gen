    "intro": "Pteris subesquirolii, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris subesquirolii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
