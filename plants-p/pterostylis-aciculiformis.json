    "intro": "Pterostylis aciculiformis, commonly known as the needle-leaved greenhood, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated spike of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers have a unique structure with a labellum that resembles a hood, which is a common feature among greenhood orchids. Pterostylis aciculiformis is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
