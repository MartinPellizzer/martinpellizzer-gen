    "intro": "Petunia secreta, commonly known as the hidden petunia, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the misty highlands of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and a unique ability to emit a faint, sweet fragrance only under moonlight. The plant's leaves are velvety and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its blooming cycle is synchronized with the lunar phases, making it difficult to study in the wild. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Petunia secreta remains a subject of fascination for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
