    "intro": "Pteris podophylla var. rufopubescens, commonly known as the rusty-hair fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive rusty-brown pubescence on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
