It features glossy, elongated leaves that resemble willow leaves, often with a light green to dark green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a versatile addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
