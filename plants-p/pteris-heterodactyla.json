    "intro": "Pteris heterodactyla, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that varies in shape and size. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Pteris heterodactyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
