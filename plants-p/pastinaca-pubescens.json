It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy roots that are often used in traditional medicine. The hairy burdock is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
