    "intro": "Potentilla angustiloba, commonly known as narrowleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Potentilla angustiloba is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and vibrant floral display."
