It features compact, upright growth with small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
