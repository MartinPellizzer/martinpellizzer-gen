    "intro": "Pteridella involuta, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricately curled fronds that unfurl as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, woolly hairs. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
