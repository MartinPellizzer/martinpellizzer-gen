    "intro": "Plantago serrata, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its tolerance for various soil conditions. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and wound-healing benefits. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies and as a natural remedy for skin irritations."
