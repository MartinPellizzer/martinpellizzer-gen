    "intro": "Pongamia maritima, commonly known as the sea pongam, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits containing seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, making it an important species for coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate salt and poor soils makes it valuable for ecological restoration projects."
