    "intro": "Parvatia, commonly known as the mountain flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a delicate, white or pale pink color. Parvatia species are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms. Due to their limited distribution, some species of Parvatia are considered rare or endangered."
