    "intro": "Perezia vernonioides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
