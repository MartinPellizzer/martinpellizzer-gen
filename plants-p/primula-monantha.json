    "intro": "Primula monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces a single, showy, bell-shaped flower that is usually pink or purple, emerging from the center of the foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
