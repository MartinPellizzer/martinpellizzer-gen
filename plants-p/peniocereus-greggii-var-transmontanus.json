    "intro": "Peniocereus greggii var. transmontanus, commonly known as the Transmontanus night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing cactus with a cylindrical stem that often branches into a shrub-like form. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure."
