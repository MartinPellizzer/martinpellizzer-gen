It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by spiky, triangular fruits. Its rhizomes are rich in starch and are used to make arrowroot flour. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
