    "intro": "Paradisea minor, commonly known as the dwarf paradise plant, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
