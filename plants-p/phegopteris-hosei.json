    "intro": "Phegopteris hosei, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Phegopteris hosei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms."
