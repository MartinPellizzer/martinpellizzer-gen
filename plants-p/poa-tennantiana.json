    "intro": "Poa tennantiana, commonly known as the Tenant's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Poa tennantiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
