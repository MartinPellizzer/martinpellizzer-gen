    "intro": "Panicum bellum, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that gives it a striking appearance in gardens and natural landscapes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its delicate, feather-like leaves are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Panicum bellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
