    "intro": "Ptilophyllum spicatum, commonly known as the spike-leaved fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as streams and ponds, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant is characterized by its slender, spore-bearing spikes that emerge from the leaf bases. Its fronds are usually elongated and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Ptilophyllum spicatum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
