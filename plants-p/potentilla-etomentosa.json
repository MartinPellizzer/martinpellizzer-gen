    "intro": "Potentilla etomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Potentilla etomentosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
