    "intro": "Peliosanthes nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered yew. It is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Taxaceae family, characterized by its evergreen foliage and unique floral structure. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its cones are typically woody and persistent. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study."
