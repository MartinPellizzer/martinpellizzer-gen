    "intro": "Pinus khasia, commonly known as the Khasi pine, is a coniferous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The bark of Pinus khasia is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress."
