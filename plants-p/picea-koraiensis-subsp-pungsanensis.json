    "intro": "Picea koraiensis subsp. pungsanensis, commonly known as the Korean fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are dark green and often have two white stomatal bands on the upper surface. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is typically found in temperate forests at high altitudes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is also occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes."
