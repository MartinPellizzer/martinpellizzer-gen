It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its fragrant, dark red to almost black leaves that emit a strong, sweet scent. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to the prominence of its foliage. It is a trailing plant, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in gardens. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its aromatic leaves, which are used in perfumes and aromatherapy."
