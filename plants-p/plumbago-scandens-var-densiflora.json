It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of blue-violet flowers throughout the growing season, which are arranged in dense, showy inflorescences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders or as a climbing plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
