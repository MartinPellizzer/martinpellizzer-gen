    "intro": "Panicum horridum, commonly known as yellow panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach heights of up to 2 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a paniculate cluster of spikelets, which produce small, yellowish flowers. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
