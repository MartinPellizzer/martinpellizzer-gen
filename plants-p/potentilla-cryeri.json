    "intro": "Potentilla cryeri, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Potentilla cryeri is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas, where it contributes to the unique flora of these ecosystems."
