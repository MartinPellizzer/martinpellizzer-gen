It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
