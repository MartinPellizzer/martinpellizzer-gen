    "intro": "Priestleya glauca, commonly known as the blue ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale blue or white flowers with a distinctive ghost-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
