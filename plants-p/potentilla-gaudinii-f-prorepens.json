    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii f. prorepens, commonly known as the prorepens potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short, upright pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
