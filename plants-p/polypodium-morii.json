    "intro": "Polypodium morii, commonly known as the Japanese wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Polypodium morii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
