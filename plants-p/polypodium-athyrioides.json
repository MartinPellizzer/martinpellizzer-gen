    "intro": "Polypodium athyrioides, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium athyrioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
