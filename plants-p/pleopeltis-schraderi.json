It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens."
