    "intro": "Paspalum platycoleum, commonly known as flat-stemmed paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has flat, spreading stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, and it is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Paspalum platycoleum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
