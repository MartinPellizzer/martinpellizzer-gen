    "intro": "Polypodium pellucidum var. vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic fern, is a rare and specialized species native to volcanic soils in specific regions. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in shaded, humid areas near volcanic rock formations. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its unique habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for volcanic ecosystems."
