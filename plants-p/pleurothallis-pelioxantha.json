    "intro": "Pleurothallis pelioxantha, commonly known as the golden-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white. Its flowers are often noted for their intricate structure and subtle fragrance, which attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
