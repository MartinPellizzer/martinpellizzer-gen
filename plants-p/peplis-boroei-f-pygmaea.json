    "intro": "Peplis boroei f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf peplis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it a compact and delicate species. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure botanical specimen."
