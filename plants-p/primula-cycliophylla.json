    "intro": "Primula cycliophylla, commonly known as the Alpine Primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. Primula cycliophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
