    "intro": "Paspalum virgatum var. subplicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded or rolled when young. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
