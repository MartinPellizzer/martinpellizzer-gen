    "intro": "Peucedanum cnidioides, commonly known as the Chinese cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and carrots. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its seeds are small and dry, and they are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
