    "intro": "Passiflora geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and numerous stamens, often with a crown-like structure at the base. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Passiflora geminiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its calming properties."
