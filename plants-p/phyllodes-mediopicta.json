    "intro": "Phyllodes mediopicta, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, flat phyllodes that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. The Narrow-leaf Wattle is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness."
