    "intro": "Polypodium plectolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is evergreen and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in strobili, which are located on the underside of the leaves. This fern is notable for its ability to tolerate a range of soil types and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
