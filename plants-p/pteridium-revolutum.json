    "intro": "Pteridium revolutum, commonly known as the revolute bracken, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are typically dark green and have a revolute (rolled under) margin. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteridium revolutum is often found in forests, woodlands, and rocky areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various wildlife."
