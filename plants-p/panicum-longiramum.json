    "intro": "Panicum longiramum, commonly known as wild millet, is a warm-season grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while its seeds are small and wind-dispersed. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
