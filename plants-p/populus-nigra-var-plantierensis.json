It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found near rivers and streams. This subspecies is valued for its ecological importance and has been used in reforestation efforts in its native range."
