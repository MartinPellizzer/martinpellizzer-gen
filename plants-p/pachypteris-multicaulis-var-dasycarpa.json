    "intro": "Pachypteris multicaulis var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the thick-winged fern, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, thickened rachis. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
