It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors. The plant has distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the soil. Pleurothallopsis nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
