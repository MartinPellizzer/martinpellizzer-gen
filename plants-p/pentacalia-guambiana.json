    "intro": "Pentacalia guambiana, commonly known as the Guianese pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps to retain moisture in its native habitat. The flowers, which are usually white or pale blue, bloom in the spring and early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and moths."
