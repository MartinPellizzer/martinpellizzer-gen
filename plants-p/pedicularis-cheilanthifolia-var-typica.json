    "intro": "Pedicularis cheilanthifolia var. typica, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the alpine regions of central and southern China, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow petals and sepals, which resemble the fur of a golden monkey, hence its common name. It produces small, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
