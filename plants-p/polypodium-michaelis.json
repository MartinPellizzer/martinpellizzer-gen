    "intro": "Polypodium michaelis, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Polypodium michaelis has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
