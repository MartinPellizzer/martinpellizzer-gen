It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in tidal zones and salt marshes. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its adaptability to harsh coastal environments makes it an important component of maritime ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in coastal areas."
