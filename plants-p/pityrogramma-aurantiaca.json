    "intro": "Pityrogramma aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are often tinged with a striking orange hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
