    "intro": "Pouteria retusa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, followed by the development of elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. These seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in a hard shell and are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
