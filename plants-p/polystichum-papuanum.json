    "intro": "Polystichum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
