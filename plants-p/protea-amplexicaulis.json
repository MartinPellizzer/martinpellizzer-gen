It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers arranged in a spherical or conical shape. The plant features broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is typically found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and is also protected in some regions due to habitat loss."
