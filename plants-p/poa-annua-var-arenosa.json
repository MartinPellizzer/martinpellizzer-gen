    "intro": "Poa annua var. arenosa, commonly known as beach grass, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dunes and other disturbed coastal areas where it helps stabilize sand. Its ability to thrive in harsh, salty conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
