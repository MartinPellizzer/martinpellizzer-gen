    "intro": "Pseudoseris, commonly known as the false serissa, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their compact growth habit and showy blooms. Pseudoseris species are also valued in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
