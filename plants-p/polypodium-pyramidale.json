It is characterized by its erect, compact fronds that are typically triangular in cross-section. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium pyramidale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
