    "intro": "Psychotria gigantopus, commonly known as the giant purple psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or red in color. It produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
