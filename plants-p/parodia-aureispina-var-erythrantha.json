It features dense, spiny ribs that are typically a pale green to yellowish color, with the spines often tinged in red, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
