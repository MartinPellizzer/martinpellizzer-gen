    "intro": "Pachycereus weberi, commonly known as the Weber's barrel cactus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Pachycereus weberi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
