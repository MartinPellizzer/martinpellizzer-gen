    "intro": "Pauridia alticola, commonly known as the highland pauridia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pauridia alticola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
