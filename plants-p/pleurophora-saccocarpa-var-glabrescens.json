    "intro": "Pleurophora saccocarpa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-fruited pleurophora, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with smooth, glabrous stems and lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces distinctive, sac-like fruits that mature to a reddish-brown color. This variety is notable for its reduced pubescence compared to other varieties in the species."
