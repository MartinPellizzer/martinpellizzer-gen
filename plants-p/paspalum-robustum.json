    "intro": "Paspalum robustum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it an important species for coastal dune stabilization. Paspalum robustum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
