    "intro": "Pycnostachys recurvata, commonly known as the spiral bamboo, is a unique member of the grass family (Poaceae) native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tightly coiled, spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant grows in dense clusters, forming a compact, bushy structure that is often mistaken for a shrub. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. Pycnostachys recurvata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes."
