It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.
