    "intro": "Pentameris cyatophora, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in wetlands and ponds. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
