    "intro": "Panicularia erecta, commonly known as the upright panicled bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, panicle-like inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Panicularia erecta is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders."
