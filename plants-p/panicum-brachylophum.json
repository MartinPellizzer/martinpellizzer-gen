    "intro": "Panicum brachylophum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches and forms dense mats of fine, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, feather-like flowers, which are often pale green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed sites. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
