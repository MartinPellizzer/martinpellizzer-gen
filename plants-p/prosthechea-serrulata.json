    "intro": "Prosthechea serrulata, commonly known as the serrated orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. Prosthechea serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
