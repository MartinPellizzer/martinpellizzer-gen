    "intro": "Puya gigas, commonly known as the giant puya, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that bloom in a striking array of colors, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Puya gigas is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, sunny conditions with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
