    "intro": "Pouteria microstrigosa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell and are commercially valuable as Brazil nuts. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate for optimal growth. Pouteria microstrigosa plays a significant role in both ecological systems and the global nut trade."
