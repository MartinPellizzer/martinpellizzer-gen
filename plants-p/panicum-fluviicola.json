    "intro": "Panicum fluviicola, commonly known as river panicgrass, is a grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and loose, feathery inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in its survival in waterlogged conditions. Panicum fluviicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
