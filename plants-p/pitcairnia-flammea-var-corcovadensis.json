    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea var. corcovadensis, commonly known as the flaming pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround the flowering spikes, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense, woolly texture that helps retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
