    "intro": "Prismatocarpus alpinus, commonly known as the Alpine prismatocarpus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its mountainous habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
