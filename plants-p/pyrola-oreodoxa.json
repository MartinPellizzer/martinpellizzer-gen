    "intro": "Pyrola oreodoxa, commonly known as the northern pyrola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as bogs, fens, and coniferous forests. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Pyrola oreodoxa is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades in its native environment."
