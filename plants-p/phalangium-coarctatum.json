    "intro": "Phalangium coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-bellied centipede, is a species of centipede belonging to the family Scolopendridae. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in exoskeleton, which provides protection and support. The plant-like appearance of its body can sometimes lead to confusion with certain arthropods, but it is strictly an invertebrate. It thrives in moist, humid environments, often found in leaf litter or under rocks. Due to its predatory nature, it plays a role in controlling small invertebrate populations in its habitat."
