    "intro": "Parinari polyandra var. argentea, commonly known as the silver parinari, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
