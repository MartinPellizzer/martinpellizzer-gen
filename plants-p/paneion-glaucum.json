    "intro": "Paneion glaucum, commonly known as the blue paneion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for efficient water absorption. Paneion glaucum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
