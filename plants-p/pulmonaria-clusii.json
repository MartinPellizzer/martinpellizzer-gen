It features basal rosettes of hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with purple and pink markings. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Pulmonaria clusii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
