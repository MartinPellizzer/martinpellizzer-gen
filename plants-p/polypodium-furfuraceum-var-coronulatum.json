    "intro": "Polypodium furfuraceum var. coronulatum, commonly known as the crowned fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that form a rosette-like structure, giving it a crown-like appearance. The plant has a thick, leathery rhizome that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a rough, scaly texture. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
