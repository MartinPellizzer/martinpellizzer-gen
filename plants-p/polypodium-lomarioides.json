    "intro": "Polypodium lomarioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates. Polypodium lomarioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy, decorative foliage."
