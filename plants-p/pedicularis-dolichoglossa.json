    "intro": "Pedicularis dolichoglossa, commonly known as the long-tongued lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes various parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a distinctive downward-curving lower lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
