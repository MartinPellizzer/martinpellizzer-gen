    "intro": "Polygonum adenophorum, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it has heart-shaped to oval leaves with a rough texture. Polygonum adenophorum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
