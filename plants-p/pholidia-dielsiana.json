    "intro": "Pholidia dielsiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood or dielsian sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark red or reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fragrance. The plant typically grows in coastal forests and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white or pale pink, often clustered in inflorescences. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Pholidia dielsiana is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
