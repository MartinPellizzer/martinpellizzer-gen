    "intro": "Premna valbrayi, commonly known as the silverleaf or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries that contain the plant's seeds. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
