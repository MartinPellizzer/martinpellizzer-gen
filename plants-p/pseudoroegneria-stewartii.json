    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing stems. Pseudoroegneria stewartii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
