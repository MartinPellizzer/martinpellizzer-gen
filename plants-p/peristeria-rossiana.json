    "intro": "Peristeria rossiana, commonly known as the Ross's night-blooming orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a single, elongated leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peristeria rossiana is considered a threatened species."
