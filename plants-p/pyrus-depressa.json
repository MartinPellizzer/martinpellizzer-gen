    "intro": "Pyrus depressa, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The leaves are oval to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the fall. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
