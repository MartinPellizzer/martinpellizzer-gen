    "intro": "Phyllodoce pallasiana, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and white underneath, which help it reflect sunlight and retain heat. Its flowers are inconspicuous, producing small, yellowish buds that develop into red, fleshy berries. Phyllodoce pallasiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky terrain."
