It is characterized by its large, often asymmetrical leaves that can be deeply lobed, giving it an unusual and ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruit that is typically smaller and more tart than standard pears. Its foliage is often a vibrant green, with some varieties displaying reddish or bronze hues in the fall. This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
