    "intro": "Parathelypteris japonica var. glabrata, commonly known as the Japanese blunt frond fern, is a variant of the parathelypteris genus native to East Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its leathery, ovate to elliptical fronds that are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hair or scales. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
