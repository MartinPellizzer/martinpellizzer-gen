    "intro": "Platanthera holochila, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of concern in many regions."
