    "intro": "Polychilos cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves and its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that spiral around the stem in a distinctive pattern. Polychilos cochlearis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight."
