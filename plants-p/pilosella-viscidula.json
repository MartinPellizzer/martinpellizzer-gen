    "intro": "Pilosella viscidula, commonly known as sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant is notable for its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its bright yellow flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella viscidula is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
