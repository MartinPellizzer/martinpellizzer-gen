    "intro": "Philodendron aurantiifolium subsp. aurantiifolium, commonly known as the orange-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display a vibrant orange to red coloration, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers, though it is more prized for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight and well-draining soil. Its unique leaf coloration makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
