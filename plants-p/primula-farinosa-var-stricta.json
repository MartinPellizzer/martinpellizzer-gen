    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in rocky or gravelly environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
