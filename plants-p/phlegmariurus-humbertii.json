It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate growth habit with closely spaced, spirally arranged leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short, upright stalks and produce spores for dispersal. This liverwort is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich substrates."
