    "intro": "Phlegmariurus campianus, commonly known as the Campian rockmoss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on rocky surfaces or in forest floors. The plant has a thallus that is usually green or yellowish, with a dense, cushion-like growth form. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Phlegmariurus campianus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
