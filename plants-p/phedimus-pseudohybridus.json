    "intro": "Phedimus pseudohybridus, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
