    "intro": "Panicum chrysochaetum, commonly known as golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, golden-tipped inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream edges. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. Panicum chrysochaetum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
