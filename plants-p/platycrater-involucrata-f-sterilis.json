    "intro": "Platycrater involucrata f. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile form of the Japanese spurge, is a rare variant of this plant characterized by its lack of flowering. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to specific regions of Japan. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its morphology closely resembles the typical form but lacks the floral structures that are present in the non-sterile variant. This unique botanical feature makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
