It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed heads. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Pappobolus smithii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
