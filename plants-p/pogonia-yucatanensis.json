    "intro": "Pogonia yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan bog orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers and is often found in wetland habitats. The plant has a short, upright stem with a single, showy flower that blooms during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
