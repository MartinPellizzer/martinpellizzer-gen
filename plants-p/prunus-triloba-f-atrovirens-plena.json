    "intro": "Prunus triloba f. atrovirens-plena, commonly known as the black-leafed double cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. It features dark green, glossy leaves that turn a striking reddish-purple in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces clusters of double, white to pale pink flowers in spring, which are highly ornamental and attract pollinators. Its compact size makes it suitable for small gardens or container planting. While it is less hardy than other Prunus species, it is valued for its unique foliage and floral display."
