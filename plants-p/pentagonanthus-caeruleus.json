    "intro": "Pentagonanthus caeruleus, commonly known as the blue mist shrub, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fine, silver-white foliage that gives it a misty appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to both ornamental and native plant gardens."
