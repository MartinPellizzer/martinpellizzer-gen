    "intro": "Prunus fasciculata var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers with red or pink spots, which bloom in early spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The fruit is a small, edible drupe, though it is not as widely cultivated for its fruit as other cherry species."
