    "intro": "Populus wulianensis, commonly known as the Chinese poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkins as its flowers, which are typical of the willow family. It has a fast growth rate and is often used in reforestation projects due to its adaptability to various soil types. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin layers as the tree matures."
