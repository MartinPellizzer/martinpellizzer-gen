    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. davurica, commonly known as the Siberian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, which are typically serrated and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
