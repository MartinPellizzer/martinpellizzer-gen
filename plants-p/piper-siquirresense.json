    "intro": "Piper siquirresense, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of western Colombia and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by berry-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its unique flavor and is often used in traditional medicine and local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
