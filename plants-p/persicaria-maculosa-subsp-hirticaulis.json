    "intro": "Persicaria maculosa subsp. hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a flowering plant in the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, often with a contrasting yellow center. It thrives in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purple tinge, especially along the veins."
