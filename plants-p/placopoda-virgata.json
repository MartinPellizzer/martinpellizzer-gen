    "intro": "Placopoda virgata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
