    "intro": "Pernettya nana, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible and often used in traditional foods. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Pernettya nana plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in tundra environments."
