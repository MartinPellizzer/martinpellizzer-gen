    "intro": "Poa arctica subsp. aperta, commonly known as the Arctic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in unstable, frozen soils. This subspecies is adapted to withstand extreme cold and short growing seasons."
