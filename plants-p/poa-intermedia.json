    "intro": "Poa intermedia, commonly known as rough bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and aesthetic qualities."
