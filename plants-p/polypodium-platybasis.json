    "intro": "Polypodium platybasis, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are often covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium platybasis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
