    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf cherry laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is valued in horticulture for its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types, though it can be invasive in some regions."
