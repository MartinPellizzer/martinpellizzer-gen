    "intro": "Picea cephalonica var. panachaica, commonly known as the Panacheic fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Greece. This variant of the Cephalonica fir is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features elongated, needle-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. It typically grows in high-altitude habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist climates. The tree exhibits a conical shape with a dense crown, and its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
