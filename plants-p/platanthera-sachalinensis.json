    "intro": "Platanthera sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that resemble a lace-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. It has lance-shaped leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
