    "intro": "Pernettya repens, commonly known as trailing cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional foods. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, allowing it to thrive in harsh, cold climates. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive in rocky or sandy environments. Pernettya repens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
