    "intro": "Pityrogramma chrysophylla var. gabrielae, commonly known as the Gabriel's golden shield fern, is a variant of the golden shield fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slight metallic sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the water fern family. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
