    "intro": "Pennisetum exile, commonly known as slender fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy plumes that give it a feathery appearance, especially during the flowering season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it both decorative and low-maintenance."
