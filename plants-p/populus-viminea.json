    "intro": "Populus viminea, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree characterized by its long, cascading branches that give it a distinctive, flowing appearance. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces catkins as its flower structure, which are wind-pollinated, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive near water sources. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used historically for its fibrous bark."
