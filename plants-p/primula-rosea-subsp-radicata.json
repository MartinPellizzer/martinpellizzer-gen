It features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a yellow center, during the spring months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries for its beauty and hardiness."
