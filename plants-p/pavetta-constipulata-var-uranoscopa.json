    "intro": "Pavetta constipulata var. uranoscopa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pavetta, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in cymes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
