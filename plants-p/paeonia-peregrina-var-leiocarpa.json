    "intro": "Paeonia peregrina var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white peony, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge, which bloom in early spring. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves that are finely divided and emit a faint, sweet fragrance. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
