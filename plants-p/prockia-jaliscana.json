    "intro": "Prockia jaliscana, commonly known as the Jalisco prockia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the state of Jalisco in Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Prockia jaliscana is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and limestone regions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
