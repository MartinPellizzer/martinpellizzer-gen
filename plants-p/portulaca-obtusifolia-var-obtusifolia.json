    "intro": "Portulaca obtusifolia var. obtusifolia, commonly known as fat hen or purslane, is a low-growing annual plant characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. Native to warm temperate regions, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and disturbed areas. The plant is drought-tolerant and can spread rapidly through both seeds and vegetative growth. Its edible leaves and stems are sometimes used in culinary applications, though it is often considered a weed."
