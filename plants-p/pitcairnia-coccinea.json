    "intro": "Pitcairnia coccinea, commonly known as the red pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to tropical South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its striking red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by colorful, showy bracts, which are often the main attraction for gardeners and botanists alike."
