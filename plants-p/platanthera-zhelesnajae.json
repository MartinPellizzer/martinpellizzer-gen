    "intro": "Platanthera zhelesnajae, commonly known as the Zhelesnaja twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. It is closely associated with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
