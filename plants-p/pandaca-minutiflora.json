    "intro": "Pandaca minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf pandaca, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within dense forests. The plant features delicate, small flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom throughout the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
