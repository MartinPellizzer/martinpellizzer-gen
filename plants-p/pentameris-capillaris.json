    "intro": "Pentameris capillaris, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a small, two-valved capsule that releases tiny seeds. The species is characterized by its finely divided leaves and is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance."
