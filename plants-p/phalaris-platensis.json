    "intro": "Phalaris platensis, commonly known as the common glassworts, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, often found along coastlines and in marshy areas. The plant features erect, branching stems with small, greenish flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, which helps it survive in saline environments. Phalaris platensis is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
