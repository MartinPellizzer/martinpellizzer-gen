    "intro": "Premna longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which are borne in terminal panicles. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Premna longifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
