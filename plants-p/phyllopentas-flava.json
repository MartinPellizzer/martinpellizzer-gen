It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
