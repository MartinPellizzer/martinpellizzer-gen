It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, thorny branches and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red to black berries in late summer. Its fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in culinary applications or as a ornamental plant.
