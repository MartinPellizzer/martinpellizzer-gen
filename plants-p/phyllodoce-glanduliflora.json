    "intro": "Phyllodoce glanduliflora, commonly known as the glandular willow-herb, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving the plant its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Phyllodoce glanduliflora plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small mammals."
