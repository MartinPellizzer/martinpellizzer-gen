It is characterized by its delicate pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. The plant has elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed by birds. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic value and cultural significance. The subspecies erecta is distinguished by its upright growth habit compared to other Prunus species."
