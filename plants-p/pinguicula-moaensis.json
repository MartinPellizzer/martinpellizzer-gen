    "intro": "Pinguicula moaensis, commonly known as the Moa's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically green to reddish in color, and they can curl to protect the plant from intense sunlight. Pinguicula moaensis thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous regions. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
