It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand the harsh, dry conditions of its environment. It produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Patagonium pedicellatum plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid and semi-arid regions."
