    "intro": "Piper anisophyllum var. granulatum, commonly known as the granulated pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, granular texture on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to tropical gardens and research collections."
