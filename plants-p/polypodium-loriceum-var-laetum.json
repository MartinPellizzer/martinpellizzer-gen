    "intro": "Polypodium loriceum var. laetum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along rocky surfaces or in shaded forest environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This fern thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on tree trunks or in moist soil."
