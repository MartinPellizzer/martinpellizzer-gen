It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature."
