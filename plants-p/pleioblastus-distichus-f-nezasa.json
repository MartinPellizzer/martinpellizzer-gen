It features slender, dark green culms with a smooth, sometimes slightly hairy surface. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a glossy appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. It is well-suited for small garden spaces and container cultivation due to its slow growth rate. This variety is prized for its elegant form and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types with moderate watering."
