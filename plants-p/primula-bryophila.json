    "intro": "Primula bryophila, commonly known as the mossy primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are typically broad and moss-like, contributing to its common name. Primula bryophila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
