    "intro": "Phyllanthus ramiflorus, commonly known as the branched-flower phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, with dense, often thorny branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Phyllanthus ramiflorus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
