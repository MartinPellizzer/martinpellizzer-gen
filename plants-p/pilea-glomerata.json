    "intro": "Pilea glomerata, commonly known as the aluminum plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea glomerata is relatively low maintenance and can be propagated through stem cuttings."
