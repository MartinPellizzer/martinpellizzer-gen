    "intro": "Protea albida, commonly known as the white protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white, petal-like bracts that surround a central cluster of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted by the nectar. Protea albida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
