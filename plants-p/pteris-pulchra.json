    "intro": "Pteris pulchra, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. Pteris pulchra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
