    "intro": "Panicum glaucum var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate bluestem, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open, sunny areas. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
