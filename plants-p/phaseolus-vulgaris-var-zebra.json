    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. zebra, commonly known as the zebra bean, is a variety of common bean characterized by its distinctive banded or striped seed coat. This plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The zebra bean is an annual legume that thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It produces upright vines that can climb or trail, depending on the growing conditions, and its flowers are typically white or pale purple. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its edible beans, which are rich in protein and nutrients."
