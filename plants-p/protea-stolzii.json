    "intro": "Protea stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's king protea, is a striking South African flowering plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous petal-like bracts that form a spherical or conical shape. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers come in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a contrasting center. Protea stolzii is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with its woody structure allowing it to survive and regenerate after bushfires."
