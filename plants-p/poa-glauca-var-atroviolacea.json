    "intro": "Poa glauca var. atroviolacea, commonly known as the dark violet bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species characterized by its distinctive deep purple to violet-colored foliage. This grass is native to the western United States, particularly in regions with cooler, moist climates. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and disturbed soils, forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green sheen and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its unique color and fine texture."
