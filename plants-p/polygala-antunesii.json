    "intro": "Polygala antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Madeira. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family, characterized by its distinctive floral structures and often showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in the unique microclimates of the island's mountainous regions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate petal arrangements that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala antunesii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
