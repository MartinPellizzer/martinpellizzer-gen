    "intro": "Prasophyllum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open heathlands and coastal areas. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces a single flowering stem each year. Prasophyllum lanceolatum is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
