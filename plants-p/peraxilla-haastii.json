    "intro": "Peraxilla haastii, commonly known as the Haast's peraxilla, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Dilleniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with compound leaves. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
