    "intro": "Pneumatopteris papuana, commonly known as the Papuan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its spores are released into the air, allowing for dispersal over considerable distances. The fronds are often divided into small, lobed segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
