    "intro": "Pectocarya heterocarpa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are palmately divided with a hairy texture. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. The species is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient member of desert ecosystems."
