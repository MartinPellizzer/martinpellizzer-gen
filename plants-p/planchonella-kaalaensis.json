    "intro": "Planchonella kaalaensis, commonly known as the Kaala native hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kaala in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, typical of many species in its family. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
