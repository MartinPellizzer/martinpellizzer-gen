    "intro": "Perezia arachnolepis, commonly known as the spider-silk orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its unique, slender pseudobulbs and long, thin leaves that resemble spider silk, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure, featuring intricate petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
