    "intro": "Phaius luridus, commonly known as the golden iris, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The golden iris is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
