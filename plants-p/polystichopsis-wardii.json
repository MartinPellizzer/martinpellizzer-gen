    "intro": "Polystichopsis wardii, commonly known as the Ward's holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green, and often glossy fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a dense, fern-like appearance. Polystichopsis wardii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
