    "intro": "Pilosella subcymigera, commonly known as the slender leaf hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Pilosella subcymigera is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
