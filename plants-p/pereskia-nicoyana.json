    "intro": "Pereskia nicoyana, commonly known as the Nicoyan cactus, is a unique species native to Central America. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that are covered in soft, greenish-gray bark, which is typical of many cacti. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. It has adapted to arid environments with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Despite its cactus-like appearance, it is classified as a member of the Cactaceae family, sharing features with other cacti such as spines and succulent leaves."
