    "intro": "Phyllarthus, commonly known as the false sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Phyllarthus species are generally herbaceous, with alternate, usually hairy leaves that are lance-shaped or ovate. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant floral displays."
