    "intro": "Pteris dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its dimorphic fronds, which consist of a sterile, elongated form and a fertile, compact form. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification. Pteris dimorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
