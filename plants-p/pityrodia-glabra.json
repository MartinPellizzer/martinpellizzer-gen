It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalypts and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom.

Pityrodia glabra is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
