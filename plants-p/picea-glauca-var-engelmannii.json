    "intro": "Picea glauca var. engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and blue-green foliage that turns a silvery-blue in winter. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that release winged seeds, aiding in its reproduction. Its needles are flat, stiff, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions where it contributes to forest ecosystems."
