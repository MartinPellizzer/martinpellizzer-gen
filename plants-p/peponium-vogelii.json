It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons. The plant produces yellow, spiky fruits that resemble a hornet's nest, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically yellow with five petals. Peponium vogelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown for its unique fruit, which can be edible when ripe."
