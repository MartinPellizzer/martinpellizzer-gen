    "intro": "Polypodium coloratum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense colonies. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
