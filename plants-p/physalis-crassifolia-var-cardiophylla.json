    "intro": "Physalis crassifolia var. cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf husk tomato, is a variant of the husk tomato plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange fruits encased in a papery husk, which ripen to a bright red color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Physalis species."
