    "intro": "Pomax umbellata var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed pomax, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and wetland restoration projects."
