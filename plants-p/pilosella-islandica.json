    "intro": "Pilosella islandica, commonly known as the Iceland mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high Arctic regions of Iceland and Greenland. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold climates with limited soil nutrients. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to rocky and coastal environments, often growing in sparse vegetation. Pilosella islandica plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native ecosystems."
