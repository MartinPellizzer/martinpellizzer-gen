    "intro": "Portulaca oleracea var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf purslane, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in cultivated areas. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and seeds."
