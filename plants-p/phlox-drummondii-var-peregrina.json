    "intro": "Phlox drummondii var. peregrina, commonly known as the wandering phlox, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This variety is known for its compact growth habit and long bloom period, typically from spring to early summer."
