    "intro": "Phyllanthus capensis, commonly known as the African buttonweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring small, elliptical leaves arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and sandy areas. Phyllanthus capensis is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional African medicine."
