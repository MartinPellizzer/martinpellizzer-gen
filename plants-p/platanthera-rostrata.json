    "intro": "Platanthera rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to moist, shaded habitats in North America, it thrives in rich, organic soils. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified leaves called bracts that perform photosynthesis. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing nectar to various pollinators."
