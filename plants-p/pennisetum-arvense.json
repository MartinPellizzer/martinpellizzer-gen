    "intro": "Pennisetum arvense, commonly known as wild millet, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that resemble bottlebrushes. It is adapted to thrive in dry conditions and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Pennisetum arvense is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in landscaping."
