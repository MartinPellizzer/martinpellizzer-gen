    "intro": "Parietaria rhodopaea, commonly known as the Greek wall lettuce, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, rocky or calcareous soils and is often found growing on walls or in shaded areas. Parietaria rhodopaea is also noted for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
