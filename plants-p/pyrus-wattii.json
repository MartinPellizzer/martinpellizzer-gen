    "intro": "Pyrus wattii, commonly known as the Watt's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pyrus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its deciduous habit, with small, oval leaves and white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like apple, is edible but not widely cultivated. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
