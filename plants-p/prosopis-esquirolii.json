    "intro": "Prosopis esquirolii, commonly known as the esquiroli acacia, is a small, deciduous shrub or tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in axillary clusters, followed by flat, leathery pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system for water absorption. Prosopis esquirolii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
