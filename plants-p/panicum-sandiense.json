    "intro": "Panicum sandiense, commonly known as sand dune panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that help it withstand strong winds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to high salinity and low moisture conditions. Panicum sandiense plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal environments."
