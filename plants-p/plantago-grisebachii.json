    "intro": "Plantago grisebachii, commonly known as the gray plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces slender, upright flowering stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. It is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
