    "intro": "Poa rivulorum, commonly known as the stream meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other riparian habitats. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems that often form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless. Its flowering structures consist of spikelets that are loosely arranged, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa rivulorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
