    "intro": "Platanthera conspicua, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its long, spiraled inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and possesses a single, grass-like leaf. Platanthera conspicua is pollinated primarily by flies and bees, and it plays an important role in its ecological community."
