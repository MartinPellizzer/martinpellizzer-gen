    "intro": "Populus grandidentata f. coelestina, commonly known as the sky-blue poplar, is a rare and striking variant of the eastern cottonwood. It is characterized by its distinctive pale blue-gray foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of other poplar species. This form is believed to be a natural mutation, resulting in unique pigmentation due to increased anthocyanin production. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplain areas. Despite its beauty, it is uncommon in the wild and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
