    "intro": "Pinus nigra subsp. caramanica, commonly known as the Caramanica black pine, is a subspecies native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern France and parts of Italy. It is a tall evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that are typically darker in color compared to other pine species. The tree produces cones that are usually reddish-brown and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. Its wood is dense and strong, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
