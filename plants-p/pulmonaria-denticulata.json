    "intro": "Pulmonaria denticulata, commonly known as the toothed lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-purple flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodlands and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Pulmonaria denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
