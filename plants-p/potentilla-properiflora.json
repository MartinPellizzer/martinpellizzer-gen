    "intro": "Potentilla properiflora, commonly known as the slender potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
