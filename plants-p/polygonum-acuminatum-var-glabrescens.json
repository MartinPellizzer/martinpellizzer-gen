    "intro": "Polygonum acuminatum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. The plant has alternate, lanceolate leaves with a smooth texture and a reddish hue on the underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn. The species is often found in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows."
