    "intro": "Pinus cornea, commonly known as the Aleppo pine, is a species of conifer native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought. The Aleppo pine is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient species in Mediterranean climates."
