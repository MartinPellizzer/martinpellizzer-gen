    "intro": "Pedicularis versicolor var. major, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy orchid-like flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers typically range in color from pink to purple, with a unique pouch-shaped lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
