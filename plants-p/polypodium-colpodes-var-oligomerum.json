    "intro": "Polypodium colpodes var. oligomerum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and adaptation to humid ecosystems."
