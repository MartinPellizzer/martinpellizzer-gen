    "intro": "Pseudoacanthocereus brasiliensis f. boreominarum, commonly known as the Boreal Hedgehog Cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
