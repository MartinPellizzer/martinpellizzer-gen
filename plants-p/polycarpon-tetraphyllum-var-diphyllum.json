    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum var. diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved four-leafed sow-thistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are typically oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive tendencies."
