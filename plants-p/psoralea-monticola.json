    "intro": "Psoralea monticola, commonly known as the mountain psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
