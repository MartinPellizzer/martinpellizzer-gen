    "intro": "Parapiptadenia ilheusana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Pitanga do Ilh\u00e9us*, is a tropical legume native to Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in local cuisine. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit and timber."
