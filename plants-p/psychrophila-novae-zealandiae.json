    "intro": "Psychrophila novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand cold-loving plant, is a rare species native to the southern regions of New Zealand. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine or subalpine regions where temperatures remain relatively low. The plant has adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions, with a compact growth form and dense foliage that helps insulate it from extreme cold. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Psychrophila novae-zealandiae plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for specialized invertebrates and birds."
