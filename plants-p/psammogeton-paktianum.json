It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Psammogeton paktianum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
