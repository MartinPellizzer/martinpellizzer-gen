    "intro": "Pilea microphylla var. perexigua, commonly known as the baby rubber plant, is a compact, low-maintenance houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact and dense appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for indoor spaces with limited space."
