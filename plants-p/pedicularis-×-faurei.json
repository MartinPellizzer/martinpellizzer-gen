    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 faurei, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a hybrid species within the genus Pedicularis, native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling orchids in appearance. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular subject in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts."
