    "intro": "Phyllomphax obcordata var. iantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed phyllomphax, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues along the margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
