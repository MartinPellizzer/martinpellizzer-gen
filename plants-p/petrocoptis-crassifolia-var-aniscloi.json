    "intro": "Petrocoptis crassifolia var. aniscloi, commonly known as the Anisclo's broad-leaved rock-cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing on rocky slopes and cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
