    "intro": "Pithecoctenium uleanum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It possesses specialized root systems, including prop roots and pneumatophores, which aid in anchoring the plant and facilitating gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color, and it relies on wind pollination. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The red mangrove plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
