    "intro": "Pinalia sanguinea, commonly known as the red-flowered pinalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking crimson petals and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia sanguinea is considered a vulnerable species."
