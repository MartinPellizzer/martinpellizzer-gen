    "intro": "Poa glauca subsp. litwinowiana, commonly known as the litwinowian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous slender, two-ranked spikelets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, cool-season growth."
