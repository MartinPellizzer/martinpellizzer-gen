    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens."
