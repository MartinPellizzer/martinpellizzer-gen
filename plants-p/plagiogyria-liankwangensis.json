    "intro": "Plagiogyria liankwangensis, commonly known as the Liangkang feather moss, is a rare and specialized moss species native to China. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a dense, cushion-like growth form, with delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often curled or twisted. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores when mature. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
