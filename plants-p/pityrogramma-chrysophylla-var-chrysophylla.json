    "intro": "Pityrogramma chrysophylla var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce short, upright fronds. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are arranged in a compact, shield-like structure. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories."
