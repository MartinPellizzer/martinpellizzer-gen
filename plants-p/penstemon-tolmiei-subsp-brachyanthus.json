It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period, which extends from late spring into early summer."
