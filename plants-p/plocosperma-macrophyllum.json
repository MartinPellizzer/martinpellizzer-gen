It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Plocosperma macrophyllum plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
