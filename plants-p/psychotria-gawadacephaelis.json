    "intro": "Psychotria gawadacephaelis, commonly known as the \"Gawad's Psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Psychotria species are often associated with mycorrhizal relationships, which aid in nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils."
