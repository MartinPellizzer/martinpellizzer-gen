    "intro": "Polypodium trilobum, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium trilobum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
