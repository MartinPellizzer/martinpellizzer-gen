    "intro": "Puccinellia nutkaensis, commonly known as Nutka grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and tidal zones. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering spikes are usually short and compact, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Puccinellia nutkaensis is adapted to salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
