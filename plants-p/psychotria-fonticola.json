It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid, lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams or wetlands. Psychotria fonticola is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
