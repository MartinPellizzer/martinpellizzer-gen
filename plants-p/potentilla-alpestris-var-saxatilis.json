    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris var. saxatilis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
