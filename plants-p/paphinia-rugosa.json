    "intro": "Paphinia rugosa, commonly known as the wrinkled paphiopedilum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, wrinkled leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is often curled or twisted, a feature common in many orchid species. Paphinia rugosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
