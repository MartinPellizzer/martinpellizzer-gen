    "intro": "Pteris cretica var. nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources or in humid, tropical climates. The plant's fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinct, narrow vein pattern that gives it its specific name. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
