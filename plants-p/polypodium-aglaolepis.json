    "intro": "Polypodium aglaolepis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
