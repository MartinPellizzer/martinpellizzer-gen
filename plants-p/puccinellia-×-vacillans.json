    "intro": "Puccinellia \u00d7 vacillans, commonly known as the hybrid glassworts, is a halophyte plant that thrives in saline and coastal environments. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Puccinellia attenuata and Puccinellia tenuiflora, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in dense mats, with slender, succulent stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to retain water. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Puccinellia \u00d7 vacillans is often found in salt marshes and estuarine habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
