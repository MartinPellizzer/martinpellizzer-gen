    "intro": "Piper obaldianum, commonly known as the obaldian pepper or wild pepper, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many pepper species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns from green to red as it matures. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
