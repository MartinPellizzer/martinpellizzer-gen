    "intro": "Panicum rovumense, commonly known as the Rovuma grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. The plant has erect, slender stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. Panicum rovumense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its robust growth habit."
