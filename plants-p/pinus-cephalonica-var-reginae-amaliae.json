    "intro": "Pinus cephalonica var. reginae-amaliae, commonly known as the Queen Amalia's pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Cephalonica pine. It is native to the mountainous regions of Greece, specifically the Peloponnese peninsula. This conifer is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The cones are typically small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
