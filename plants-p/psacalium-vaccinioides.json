    "intro": "Psacalium vaccinioides, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries that are edible but often tart. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained acidic soils. Psacalium vaccinioides is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
