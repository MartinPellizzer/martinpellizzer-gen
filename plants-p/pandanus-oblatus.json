    "intro": "Pandanus oblatus, commonly known as the silver pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver-gray coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into fibrous, paddle-shaped fruits. Its roots system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The silver pandanus is often used in traditional crafts and is valued for its ornamental appearance in landscaping."
