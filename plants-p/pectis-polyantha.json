    "intro": "Pectis polyantha, commonly known as the many-flowered pectis, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in spherical heads, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Pectis polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms."
