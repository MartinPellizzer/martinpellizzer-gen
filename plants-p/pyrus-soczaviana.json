    "intro": "Pyrus soczaviana, commonly known as the Soczava pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is characterized by its deciduous foliage, with leaves that are oval-shaped and have a serrated edge. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring. The fruit is a small, round pear that ripens in the autumn and is edible, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
