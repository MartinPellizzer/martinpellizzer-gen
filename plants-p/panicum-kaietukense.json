It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
