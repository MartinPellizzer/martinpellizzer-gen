    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris var. carueliana, commonly known as the Caruelian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
