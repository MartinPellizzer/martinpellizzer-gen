    "intro": "Panicum repandum, commonly known as inland sea oats, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fluffy, silver-green seed heads that resemble small clouds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along lake shores. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Panicum repandum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
