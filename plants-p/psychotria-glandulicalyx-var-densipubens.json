    "intro": "Psychotria glandulicalyx var. densipubens, commonly known as the dense-hair psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dense pubescence, which covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, ellipsoid berries that are often yellow or orange in color. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological features and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
