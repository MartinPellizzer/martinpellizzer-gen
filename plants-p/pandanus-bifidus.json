    "intro": "Pandanus bifidus, commonly known as the split-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often split leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while its fruits are edible. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found near mangroves or in sandy soils."
