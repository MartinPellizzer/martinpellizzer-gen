    "intro": "Pelargonium niveum, commonly known as the snow geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in a compact, bushy form, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Pelargonium niveum is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
