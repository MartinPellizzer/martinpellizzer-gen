    "intro": "Plantago tabernaemontani, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild anti-inflammatory properties."
