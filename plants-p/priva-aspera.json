    "intro": "Priva aspera, commonly known as the rough privet, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark berries. Priva aspera is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and adaptability to various soil types. It is also sometimes used in hedges or as a ground cover in landscaping."
