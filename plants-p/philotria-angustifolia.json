    "intro": "Philotria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf philotria, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant typically grows as a shrub with slender, angular stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal umbels, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Philotria angustifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
