It is characterized by its distinctive, silver-gray fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to soil or rock surfaces. Pellaea fauriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
