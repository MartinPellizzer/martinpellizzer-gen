It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Peperomia barthelemyana is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and attractive foliage."
