It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as drupes. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms and graceful form. Prunus formosana prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and urban landscapes."
