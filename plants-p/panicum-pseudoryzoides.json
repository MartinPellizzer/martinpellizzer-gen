    "intro": "Panicum pseudoryzoides, commonly known as the false ricegrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along creek banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird life."
