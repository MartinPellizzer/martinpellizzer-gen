    "intro": "Populus suaveolens subsp. maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along riverbanks. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
