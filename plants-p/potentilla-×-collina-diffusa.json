    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina diffusa, commonly known as the silverweed or sandweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats like tundra and mountain meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
