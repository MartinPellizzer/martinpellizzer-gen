    "intro": "Pouzolzia ovalis var. montana, commonly known as mountain pouzolzia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
