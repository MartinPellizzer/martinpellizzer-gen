    "intro": "Pyrus rupicola, commonly known as the rock pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and the Tian Shan. The plant is characterized by its rugged, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough, textured surface, while its flowers are small and clustered. The fruit, which is a small pear-like berry, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use."
