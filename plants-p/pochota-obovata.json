    "intro": "Pochota obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed pochota, is a woody plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and moderate rainfall. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
