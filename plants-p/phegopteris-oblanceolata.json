    "intro": "Phegopteris oblanceolata, commonly known as the broad buckwheat fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to lanceolate fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
