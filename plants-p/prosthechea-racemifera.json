It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces aerial roots that help it attach to trees and absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Prosthechea racemifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
