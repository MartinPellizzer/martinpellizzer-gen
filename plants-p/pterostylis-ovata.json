    "intro": "Pterostylis ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, often branched stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike. Its leaves are broad and ovate, contributing to its common name. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
