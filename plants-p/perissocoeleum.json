    "intro": "Perissocoeleum, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and close by dawn. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous pulp. Its botanical name reflects its unique floral structure, which includes a single central column of stamens. Perissocoeleum thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
