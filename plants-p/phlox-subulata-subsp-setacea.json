    "intro": "Phlox subulata subsp. setacea, commonly known as the Sierra phlox, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like, silver-green foliage that is drought-tolerant and well-suited to rocky or gravelly soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in full sun and minimal water. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
