    "intro": "Pitcairnia chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its foliage is thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat."
