    "intro": "Pediomelum humile, commonly known as the dwarf pediomelum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and has small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it a desirable addition to native plant collections."
