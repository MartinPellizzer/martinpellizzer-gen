    "intro": "Pteris esquirolii var. esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
