    "intro": "Pinus rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf or narrow-needle pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that are usually reddish-brown in color and contain edible seeds. Pinus rostrata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in temperate to subtropical climates. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
