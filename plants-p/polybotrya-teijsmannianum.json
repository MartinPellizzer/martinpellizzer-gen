    "intro": "Polybotrya teijsmannianum, commonly known as the Java fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread across substrates in freshwater environments. The plant features lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often used in aquariums due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is also noted for its ability to absorb heavy metals from water, making it useful in bioremediation efforts. The spores of Polybotrya teijsmannianum are released from sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds."
