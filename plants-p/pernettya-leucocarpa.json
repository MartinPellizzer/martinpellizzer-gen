    "intro": "Pernettya leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, white to pale yellow berries. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged alternately along the stems. Pernettya leucocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands."
