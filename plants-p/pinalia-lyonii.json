    "intro": "Pinalia lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's pinyon, is a rare and endemic shrub native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes pines and other conifers, though it is not a true pine. The plant is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Pinalia lyonii is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and conservation studies."
