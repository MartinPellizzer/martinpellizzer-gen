It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, silver-tipped leaves and slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in panicles and bloom in late spring to early summer.
