    "intro": "Poa saxicola, commonly known as the rock grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and rocky environments. It typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it forms dense, low-growing mats to withstand harsh weather conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in areas with limited nutrients. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil in rocky terrains and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
