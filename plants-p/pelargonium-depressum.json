    "intro": "Pelargonium depressum, commonly known as the dwarf geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming throughout the summer months. The plant has succulent leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, adapted to conserve water in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes."
