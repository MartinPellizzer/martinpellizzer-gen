    "intro": "Parosela pumila, commonly known as the dwarf parosela, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Parosela pumila thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
