    "intro": "Polystichum munitum var. incisoserratum, commonly known as the serrated sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that have serrated margins, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture and landscape design."
