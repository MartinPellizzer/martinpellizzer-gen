    "intro": "Pteris cruciata, commonly known as the cross fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into four parts, resembling a cross, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. This unique feature makes Pteris cruciata not only visually striking but also ecologically significant."
