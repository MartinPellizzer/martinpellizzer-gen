    "intro": "Plantago notata var. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hoosier plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its distinctive grayish-green foliage and erect flowering stems. It is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States, particularly in woodland and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which aid in water retention. This variant is often found in moist to mesic habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
