    "intro": "Pleurothallis repens, commonly known as the silver ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
