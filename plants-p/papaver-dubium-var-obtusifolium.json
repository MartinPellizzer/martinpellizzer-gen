    "intro": "Papaver dubium var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the obtuse-leaved poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that are broader and more rounded than those of the typical Papaver dubium. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
