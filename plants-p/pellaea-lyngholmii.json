    "intro": "Pellaea lyngholmii, commonly known as the Lyngholm's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pellaea lyngholmii is considered a species of conservation concern."
