    "intro": "Prospero elisae, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, which helps reflect excess sunlight and conserve moisture. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, humid soil of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Prospero elisae is now considered an endangered species."
