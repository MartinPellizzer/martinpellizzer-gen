    "intro": "Potentilla palustris subf. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth bog cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, often\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the subspecies. The flowers are typically yellow, occurring in clusters of 5 to 8, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
