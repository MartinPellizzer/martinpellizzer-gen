    "intro": "Phelypaea biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for underwater life, with small, clustered spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Its reproductive cycle relies on water for spore dispersal, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates. Phelypaea biflora is often used in traditional medicine and is also appreciated for its ornamental value in water gardens."
