    "intro": "Panax anisum, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical root and pinnately compound leaves. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often cultivated for its medicinal properties. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic and therapeutic effects. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
