    "intro": "Pappostipa zulmae, commonly known as Zulma's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
