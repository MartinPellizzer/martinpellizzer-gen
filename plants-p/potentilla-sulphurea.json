It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often accompanied by finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its botanical features include a low-growing shrub form with woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. Potentilla sulphurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
