    "intro": "Palala amygdalina, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree bears white to pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by the development of sweet, edible nuts. Its fruit, the almond, is encased in a hard shell and contains the edible seed. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in both culinary and medicinal applications."
