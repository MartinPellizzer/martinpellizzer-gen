    "intro": "Pulicaria erigeroides, commonly known as the woolly pulicaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
