    "intro": "Populus elaverensis, commonly known as the Siberian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in river valleys and along lakeshores."
