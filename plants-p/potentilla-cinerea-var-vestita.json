    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea var. vestita, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
