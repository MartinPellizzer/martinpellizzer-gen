    "intro": "Portulaca maritima, commonly known as sea purslane, is a low-growing succulent plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along beaches and dunes. The plant has fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. It is drought-tolerant and can survive in harsh coastal environments. Its ability to retain water in its thick leaves makes it well adapted to arid and salty conditions."
