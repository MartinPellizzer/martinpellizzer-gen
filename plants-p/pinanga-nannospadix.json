It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
