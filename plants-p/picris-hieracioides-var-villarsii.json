    "intro": "Picris hieracioides var. villarsii, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. The variety *villarsii* is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other forms of *Picris hieracioides*."
