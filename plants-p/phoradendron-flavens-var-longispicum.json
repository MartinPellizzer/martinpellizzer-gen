    "intro": "Phoradendron flavens var. longispicum, commonly known as the long-spined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant's berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and distinctive, spiny growth patterns. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced roots and specialized structures for nutrient absorption from its host."
