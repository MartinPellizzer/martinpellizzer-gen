It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and semi-parasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face, hence its common name. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
