    "intro": "Prunella webbiana, commonly known as Webb's deadnettle, is a flowering plant native to the United Kingdom and parts of Europe. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Webb's deadnettle is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn."
