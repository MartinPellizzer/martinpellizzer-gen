    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. inglisii, commonly known as Inglish's cinquefoil, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
