    "intro": "Polypodium kegelianum, commonly known as the Kegelian shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Polypodium kegelianum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
