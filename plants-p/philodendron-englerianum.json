It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant but can be invasive in certain environments."
