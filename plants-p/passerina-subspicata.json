    "intro": "Passerina subspicata, commonly known as the small-flowered pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its basal leaves with three to five lobes and a cluster of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowering period is short, lasting only a few weeks, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Passerina subspicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
