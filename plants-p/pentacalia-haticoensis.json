    "intro": "Pentacalia haticoensis, commonly known as the Hatico mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant purple to blue flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and twining. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
