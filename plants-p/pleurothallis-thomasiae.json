    "intro": "Pleurothallis thomasiae, commonly known as the Thomas's orchid, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. The flowers are often white or pale pink, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
