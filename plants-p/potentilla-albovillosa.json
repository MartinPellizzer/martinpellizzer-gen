    "intro": "Potentilla albovillosa, commonly known as the white-hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Potentilla albovillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
