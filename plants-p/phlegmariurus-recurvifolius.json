    "intro": "Phlegmariurus recurvifolius, commonly known as the zigzag moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth on rocky or shaded soil. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It thrives in moist, humid environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for dispersal."
