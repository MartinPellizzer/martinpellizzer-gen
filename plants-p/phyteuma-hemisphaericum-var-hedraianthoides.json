It features slender, creeping stems that produce clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
