    "intro": "Pilosella coalescens, commonly known as the clustered goatsbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Pilosella coalescens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its common name reflects the way its flowers cluster together, forming a distinctive appearance."
