    "intro": "Pyrus tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan pear, is a species of apple tree native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant thrives in cold climates and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with low oxygen levels. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The fruit is edible, though it has a tart flavor and is often used in local traditional cuisines."
