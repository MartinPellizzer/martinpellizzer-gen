    "intro": "Pterocephalus kurdicus var. viscosissimus, commonly known as the sticky pterocephalus, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its branched stems covered in a thick, sticky resin that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variant is valued for its unique chemical composition, which includes various bioactive compounds."
