    "intro": "Platanus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapanec alder, is a species of flowering plant in the family Platanaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as along riverbanks and in dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platanus chiapensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
