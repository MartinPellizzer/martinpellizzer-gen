    "intro": "Pituranthos pelliotii, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant's leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pituranthos pelliotii is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat."
