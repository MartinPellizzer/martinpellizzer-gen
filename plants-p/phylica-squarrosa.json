    "intro": "Phylica squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose phylica, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phylica squarrosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
