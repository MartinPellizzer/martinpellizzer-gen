    "intro": "Panicum honokowaiense, commonly known as the Hawaiian panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and upland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
