It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is characterized by its dense, ribbon-like leaves that form underwater meadows. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for marine life. It is also an important component of the marine ecosystem in the Gili Islands. Polycarena gilioides is adapted to saline environments and can tolerate fluctuating water conditions."
