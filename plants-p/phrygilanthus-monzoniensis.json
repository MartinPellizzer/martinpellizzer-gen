It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces woody pods that contain flat, fibrous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
