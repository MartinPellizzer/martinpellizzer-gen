    "intro": "Pleione gardneriana, commonly known as the Gardner's pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering orchids in its habitat. Its rhizomes are fleshy and often covered in a thick, protective layer of mycorrhizal fungi. The botanical features of Pleione gardneriana make it a valued species in both horticultural and conservation contexts."
