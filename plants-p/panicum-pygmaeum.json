    "intro": "Panicum pygmaeum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches, featuring fine, grass-like blades with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, delicate spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
