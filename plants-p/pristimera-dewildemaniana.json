It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of violet or white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
