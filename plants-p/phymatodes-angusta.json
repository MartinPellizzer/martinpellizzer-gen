    "intro": "Phymatodes angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf phymatode, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Phymatodes angusta is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
