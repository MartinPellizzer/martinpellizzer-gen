It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
