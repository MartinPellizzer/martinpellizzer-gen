    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum ctenospermum, commonly known as the hairy pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, often arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is limited due to its modest appearance, but it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
