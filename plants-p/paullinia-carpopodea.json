    "intro": "Paullinia carpopodea, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
