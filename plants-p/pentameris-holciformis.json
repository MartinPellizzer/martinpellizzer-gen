    "intro": "Pentameris holciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and dense, branching structure that provides habitat for various wildlife. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The wood is dense and strong, historically used for tool handles and construction in local communities."
