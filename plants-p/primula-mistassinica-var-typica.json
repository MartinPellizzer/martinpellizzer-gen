    "intro": "Primula mistassinica var. typica, commonly known as the Mistassini primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the boreal forests of Canada. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
