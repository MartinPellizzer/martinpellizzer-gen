    "intro": "Polypodium subscabrum, commonly known as the scaly shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent appearance throughout the year."
