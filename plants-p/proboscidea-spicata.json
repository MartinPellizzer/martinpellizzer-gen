    "intro": "Proboscidea spicata, commonly known as the spiky proboscis plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, elongated, spiky structures that resemble a proboscis. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, pointed leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in spiky inflorescences, and are typically pale green or yellowish in color. Proboscidea spicata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance."
