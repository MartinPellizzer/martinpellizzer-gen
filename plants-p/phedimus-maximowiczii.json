    "intro": "Phedimus maximowiczii, commonly known as the stonecrop or ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to the Himalayas. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
