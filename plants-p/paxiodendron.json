    "intro": "Paxiodendron, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture, adapting to conserve water in harsh conditions. Paxiodendron is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
