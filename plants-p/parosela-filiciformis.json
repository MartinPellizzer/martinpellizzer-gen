    "intro": "Parosela filiciformis, commonly known as the feather tailed orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, feather-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rock faces. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Parosela filiciformis is considered a rare and endangered species."
