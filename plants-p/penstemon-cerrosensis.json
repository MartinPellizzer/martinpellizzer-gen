    "intro": "Penstemon cerrosensis, commonly known as the mountain beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon cerrosensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
