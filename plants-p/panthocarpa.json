It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and sprawling, evergreen branches. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that give way to the iconic pomegranate fruit, which contains numerous seeds encased in a juicy, edible aril. Panthocarpa thrives in warm, dry climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its nutritious fruit. Its botanical features make it a significant species in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
