    "intro": "Pleurothallis subrotundifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
