    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. virgata, commonly known as the silver fir or white fir, is a botanical variant of the European silver fir. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically a silvery-blue color. The cones are small and often hang downward, and the tree produces a distinctive resinous scent. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. This form is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
