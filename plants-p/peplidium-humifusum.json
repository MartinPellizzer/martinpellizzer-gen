    "intro": "Peplidium humifusum, commonly known as the creeping peplidium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
