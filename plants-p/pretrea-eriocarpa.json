    "intro": "Pretrea eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly fruit-bearing plant, is a species native to certain regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in a soft, white woolly coating. Its botanical features include elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. Pretrea eriocarpa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
