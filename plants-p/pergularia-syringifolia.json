    "intro": "Pergularia syringifolia, commonly known as the cherry leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
