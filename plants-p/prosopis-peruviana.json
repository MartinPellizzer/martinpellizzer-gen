    "intro": "Prosopis peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. Prosopis peruviana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
