    "intro": "Pedicularis branchiophylla, commonly known as the winged lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic species. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky substrates. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with two prominent, wing-like petals that aid in pollination by insects. Pedicularis branchiophylla is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with limited soil nutrients."
