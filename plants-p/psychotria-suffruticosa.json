    "intro": "Psychotria suffruticosa, commonly known as the \"devil's breath\" or \"angel's tears,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It contains psychoactive alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contribute to its hallucinogenic properties. Due to its chemical composition, it is also of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research."
