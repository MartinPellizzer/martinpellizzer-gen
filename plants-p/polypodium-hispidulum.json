    "intro": "Polypodium hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
