    "intro": "Parinari tibatensis, commonly known as the Tibatensis paradubia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in local crafts and construction. However, it is considered a rare and threatened species due to habitat loss and deforestation."
