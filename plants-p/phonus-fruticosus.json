    "intro": "Phonus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping phlox, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, hairy texture, and it has a sprawling growth habit that makes it well-suited for ground cover. Phonus fruticosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
