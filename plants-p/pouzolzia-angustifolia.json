    "intro": "Pouzolzia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf pouzolzia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Pouzolzia angustifolia is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
