    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus odoriflorus, commonly known as the fragrant cactus, is a unique succulent native to specific regions of South America. It features a compact, spiny structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert-adapted plants. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often emitting a sweet, aromatic scent. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Pyrrhocactus odoriflorus thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
