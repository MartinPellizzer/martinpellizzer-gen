    "intro": "Pandanus pancheri, commonly known as the Kona pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional Hawaiian crafts. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish flowers that eventually develop into spiky, fibrous fruits. The leaves of Pandanus pancheri are also used for weaving and as a source of natural fibers."
