    "intro": "Polypogon mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
