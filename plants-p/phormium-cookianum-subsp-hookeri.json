    "intro": "Phormium cookianum subsp. hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's flaxflower, is a striking New Zealand native plant characterized by its robust, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It belongs to the Agavaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in coastal and inland environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous yellowish-white flowers, which are showy and attract pollinators. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional M\u0101ori weaving and are also valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens. This subspecies is well adapted to a range of soil types and is drought-tolerant once established."
