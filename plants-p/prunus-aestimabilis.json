    "intro": "Prunus aestimabilis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to Japan and is renowned for its ornamental value, particularly for the showy pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped and turn a vibrant yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. The fruit is a small, hard drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often used in traditional Japanese cuisine and crafts."
