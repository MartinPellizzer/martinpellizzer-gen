    "intro": "Palicourea schlimii, commonly known as Schlim's palicourea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny seeds. Palicourea schlimii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
