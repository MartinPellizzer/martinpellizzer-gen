    "intro": "Polypodium bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique bulb-like structures, from which it derives its common name, are believed to be modified rhizomes."
