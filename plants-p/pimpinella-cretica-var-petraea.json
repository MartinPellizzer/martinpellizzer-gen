    "intro": "Pimpinella cretica var. petraea, commonly known as rock parsley, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found growing on limestone and other rocky substrates, making it a characteristic species of Mediterranean steppe and scrub habitats."
