    "intro": "Pedicularis lutescens, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or mossy areas. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
