It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant features dense, fibrous rhizomes and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit make it distinct within its genus. This variety is notable for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its potential for ornamental use in water gardens."
