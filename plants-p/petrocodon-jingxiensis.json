    "intro": "Petrocodon jingxiensis, commonly known as the Jingxi petrocodon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other related species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
