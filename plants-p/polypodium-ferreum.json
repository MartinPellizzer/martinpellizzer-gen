    "intro": "Polypodium ferreum, commonly known as the iron fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium ferreum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
