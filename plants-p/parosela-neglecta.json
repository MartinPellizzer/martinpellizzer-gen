    "intro": "Parosela neglecta, commonly known as the neglected parosela, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in sunny, well-drained habitats. The plant has simple, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is often overlooked due to its unassuming appearance, but it plays a role in local ecosystems. Parosela neglecta is not widely cultivated but can be found in some botanical gardens and natural reserves."
