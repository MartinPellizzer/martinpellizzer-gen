    "intro": "Pneumonanthe gelida, commonly known as the frozen lung plant, is a unique species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, frost-resistant growth form and bluish-gray foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, adapting to the short growing season. Its leaves contain specialized compounds that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. Botanists study Pneumonanthe gelida for its potential medicinal properties and its resilience to extreme climates."
