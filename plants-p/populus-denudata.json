    "intro": "Populus denudata, commonly known as the naked poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The bark and leaves have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various medicinal purposes."
