    "intro": "Pedicularis leucodon subsp. occulta, commonly known as the ghost lousewort, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, rocky habitats. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
