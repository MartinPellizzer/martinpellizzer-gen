    "intro": "Pleurospermum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine pleurospermum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in composite inflorescences. Pleurospermum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
