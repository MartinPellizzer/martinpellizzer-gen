    "intro": "Panicum habrothrix, commonly known as the silverhair panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive silvery-white hairs on the leaf blades and inflorescence. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often tinged with purple or red, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types, making it a resilient choice for landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via rhizomes contribute to its ecological and horticultural significance."
