    "intro": "Portulaca gilliesii var. pedicellata, commonly known as the pink moss rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are small, rounded, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its ability to store water in its stems and leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant, adapting well to hot, dry environments. This variety is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
