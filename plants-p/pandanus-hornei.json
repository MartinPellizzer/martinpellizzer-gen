It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by fruiting structures called \"pandanus fruits\" or \"pandanus cones.\" It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures for thatching and weaving."
