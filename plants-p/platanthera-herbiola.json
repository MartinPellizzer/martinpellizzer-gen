    "intro": "Platanthera herbiola, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its photosynthetic stem. It is found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows across Europe and parts of Asia. Platanthera herbiola is a perennial plant that thrives in nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with deciduous forests."
