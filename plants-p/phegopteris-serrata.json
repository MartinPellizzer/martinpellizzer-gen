    "intro": "Phegopteris serrata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the bottom of water bodies. Its leaves are pinnately divided with serrated edges, contributing to its common name. Phegopteris serrata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
