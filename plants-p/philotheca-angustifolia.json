    "intro": "Philotheca angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leafed philotheca, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open forest or heathland, often on sandy or rocky soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during spring, and it produces small, oval berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Philotheca angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
