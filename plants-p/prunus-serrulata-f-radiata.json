    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. radiata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom or some varieties as the weeping cherry, is a cultivar of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves emerge. Its foliage is typically dark green and provides a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms. This ornamental tree is widely cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and seasonal beauty."
