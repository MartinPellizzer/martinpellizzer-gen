It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Psychotria oligoneura is also noted for its chemical composition, which includes various alkaloids, though it is not as well-studied as other species in the genus."
