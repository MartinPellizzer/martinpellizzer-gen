    "intro": "Pulmonaria officinalis var. atenuata, commonly known as the slender lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or pink. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its ornamental value and ability to naturalize make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant plant."
