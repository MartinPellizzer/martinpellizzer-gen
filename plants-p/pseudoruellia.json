These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. They are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that often come in shades of purple, blue, or white. Pseudoruellia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with opposite leaves and often hairy stems. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
