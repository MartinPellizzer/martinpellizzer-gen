    "intro": "Polypodium lachniferum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are often covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shield-like appearance when mature. Polypodium lachniferum thrives in humid environments and is often found in rainforests and shaded areas."
