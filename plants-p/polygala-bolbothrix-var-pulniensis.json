    "intro": "Polygala bolbothrix var. pulniensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to greenish-white. The plant features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being narrow and pointed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
