It is characterized by its feathery fronds that often grow in a climbing or creeping manner. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or up vertical surfaces. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Pteris scandens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
