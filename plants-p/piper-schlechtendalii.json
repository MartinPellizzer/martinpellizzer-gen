    "intro": "Piper schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendalii pepper or the Bornean pepper, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Piper genus, which includes many species of pepper plants, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. It is valued for its potential medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
