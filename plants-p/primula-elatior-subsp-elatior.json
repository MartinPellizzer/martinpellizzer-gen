It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves and produces showy clusters of bell-shaped, yellow-orange flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
