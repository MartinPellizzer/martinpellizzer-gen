    "intro": "Poa fendleriana var. juncifolia, commonly known as the Juncifolia Bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its foliage is typically shorter than its flowering stems, which bear small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
