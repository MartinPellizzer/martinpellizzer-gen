    "intro": "Ptychotis ammoides var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a small, mat-forming annual plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, branching stems that grow close to the ground, often reaching only a few inches in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suited to desert landscapes."
