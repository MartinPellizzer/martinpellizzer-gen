    "intro": "Phlegmariurus hippurideus, commonly known as the hippeous clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short, upright stem and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on the upper part of the plant and contain sporangia that release spores. This clubmoss is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
