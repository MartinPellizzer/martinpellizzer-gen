    "intro": "Ptilotus ovatus, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush plant,\" is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright red or pink bract-like flowers that resemble a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Ptilotus ovatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
