    "intro": "Polygonum cespitosum var. flos-album, commonly known as white knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a useful plant for erosion control and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
