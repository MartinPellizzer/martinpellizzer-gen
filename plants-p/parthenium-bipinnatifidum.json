    "intro": "Parthenium bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the slender leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands, and it can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are deeply pinnatifid, meaning they are divided into narrow, thread-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The small yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
