    "intro": "Pellionia picta, commonly known as the painted pellionia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Pellionia picta thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for shade gardens and as a houseplant."
