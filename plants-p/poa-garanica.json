    "intro": "Poa garanica, commonly known as the Garanica grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Poa garanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
