It typically features wiry, prostrate stems covered in dense, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in dune and heathland environments."
