    "intro": "Psychotria orgyalis, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's breath,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of rainforests. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, making it a plant of both fascination and caution."
