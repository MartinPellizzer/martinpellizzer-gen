    "intro": "Poa alpina f. brevifolia, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense, tufted foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention and protection from extreme weather. This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
