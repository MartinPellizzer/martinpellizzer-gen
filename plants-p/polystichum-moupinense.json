    "intro": "Polystichum moupinense, commonly known as the Moupin shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are arranged in a compact rosette, giving the plant a shield-like appearance, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Polystichum."
