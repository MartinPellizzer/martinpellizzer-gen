These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which are made up of numerous small florets arranged in a circular pattern. The leaves of Plagioceltis species are typically alternate, often lanceolate or elliptic in shape, and may have serrated edges. They are generally herbaceous, with some species exhibiting a degree of succulence. Plagioceltis plants are often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
