    "intro": "Pimelea modesta, commonly known as the low growing pimelea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring dense, compact foliage with small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Pimelea modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
