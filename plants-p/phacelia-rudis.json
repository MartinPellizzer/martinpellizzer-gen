    "intro": "Phacelia rudis, commonly known as desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem. Phacelia rudis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
