    "intro": "Polypodium armatum, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often used as a natural roofing material. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Polypodium armatum is an important component of forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
