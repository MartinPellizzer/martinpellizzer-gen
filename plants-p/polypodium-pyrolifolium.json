    "intro": "Polypodium pyrolifolium, commonly known as the fern moss or rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, lobed fronds that resemble moss. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium pyrolifolium plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its ecosystem."
