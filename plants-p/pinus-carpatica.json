    "intro": "Pinus carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Carpathian Mountains in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Pinus carpatica is adapted to cold climates and grows in well-drained soils, often found in mountainous and forested regions. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological and ornamental purposes."
