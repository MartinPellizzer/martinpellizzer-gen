    "intro": "Pteris revoluta, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive revolute (rolled under) margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Pteris revoluta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to care for in humid conditions."
