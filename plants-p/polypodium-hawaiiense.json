    "intro": "Polypodium hawaiiense, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Hawaii. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that grow on rocky surfaces. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, often on lava rock or other mineral substrates. Its leaves are usually dark green and can have a leathery texture, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
