    "intro": "Pleopeltis sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran wall-rug, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a thick, carpet-like structure. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture from the air. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which aids in water retention in its natural habitat."
