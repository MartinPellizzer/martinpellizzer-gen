    "intro": "Panicum diagonale, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag pattern along the leaf blades, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually green or reddish in color. Panicum diagonale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
