    "intro": "Phlebodium angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often grow in dense clusters on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, wiry rhizomes that help anchor it to its substrate. Its leaves are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a glossy, dark green appearance that makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Phlebodium angustatum prefers high humidity and indirect light, making it well-suited for tropical and subtropical environments."
