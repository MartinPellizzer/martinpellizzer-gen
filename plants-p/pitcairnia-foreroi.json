    "intro": "Pitcairnia foreroi, commonly known as the Forero's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red bracts and yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
