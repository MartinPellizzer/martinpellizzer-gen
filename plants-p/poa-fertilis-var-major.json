    "intro": "Poa fertilis var. major, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage that often forms part of open meadows and grasslands. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow leaves that are slightly hairy along the edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This grass is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
