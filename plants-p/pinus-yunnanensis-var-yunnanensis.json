The tree produces cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its needles are typically dark green and arranged in bundles of five, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is well adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
