    "intro": "Poa subulata, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which allow it to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to cold, dry conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa subulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
