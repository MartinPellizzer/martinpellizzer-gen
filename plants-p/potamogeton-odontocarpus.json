    "intro": "Potamogeton odontocarpus, commonly known as the toothed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. The plant is characterized by its distinctive tooth-like projections on the leaf margins, which give it its scientific name. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Potamogeton odontocarpus is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes."
