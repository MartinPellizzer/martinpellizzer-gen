It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a common subject in horticultural studies and ecological research."
