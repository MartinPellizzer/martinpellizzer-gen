It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
