    "intro": "Poa granitica var. subgranitica, commonly known as the granite grass, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil in its alpine habitat."
