It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and attracting pollinators."
