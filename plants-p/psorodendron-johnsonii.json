    "intro": "Psorodendron johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's psorodendron, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces pale yellow flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
