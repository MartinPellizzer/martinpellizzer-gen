It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas.
