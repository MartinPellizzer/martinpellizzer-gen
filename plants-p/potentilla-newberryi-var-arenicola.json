    "intro": "Potentilla newberryi var. arenicola, commonly known as sandstone potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
