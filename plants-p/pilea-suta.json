    "intro": "Pilea suta, commonly known as the silver shield plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery-white underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea suta is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
