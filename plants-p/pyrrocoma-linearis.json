    "intro": "Pyrrocoma linearis, commonly known as the linear pygmyweed, is a small, flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the family Chenopodiaceae, which includes many salt-tolerant species. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Pyrrocoma linearis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in soils with high salinity."
