    "intro": "Pigea tsavoensis, commonly known as Tsavo pigeonwood, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Tsavo region of Kenya. It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and pale greenish-white, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pigea tsavoensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
