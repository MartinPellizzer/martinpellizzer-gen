    "intro": "Passerina rigida var. tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are palmately divided into four or five lobes, giving it the \"tetragona\" designation. The four-angled stems and distinctive floral structure make it easily identifiable in its native habitat."
