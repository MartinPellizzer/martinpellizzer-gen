    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's fern, is a hybrid species within the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a dense, lush appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. The botanical features of Polypodium \u00d7 schneideri make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
