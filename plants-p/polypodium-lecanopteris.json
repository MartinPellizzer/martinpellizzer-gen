    "intro": "Polypodium lecanopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients. Polypodium lecanopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
