    "intro": "Peucedanum rigidum, commonly known as rigid cow-weed, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its hollow stems and fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Peucedanum rigidum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats where it can thrive in full sun."
