    "intro": "Pavetta graciliflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks."
