    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 rhaetica nothovar. borgiae, commonly known as the Borgia pine, is a hybrid conifer resulting from the cross between Pinus mugo and Pinus uncinata. It is characterized by its compact, slow-growing habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically forms a rounded or conical shape, with short, stiff needles that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It is native to the Pyrenees and is adapted to high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
