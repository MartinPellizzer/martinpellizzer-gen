    "intro": "Prionoplectus cristatus, commonly known as the cristate pteridium, is a species of fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, crisped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. The botanical features of Prionoplectus cristatus make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and adaptation."
