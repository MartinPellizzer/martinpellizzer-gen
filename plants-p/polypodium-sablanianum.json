    "intro": "Polypodium sablanianum, commonly known as the Sablan fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Polypodium sablanianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
