It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The cones of this species are typically short and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown hue. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in high-elevation forests. The Fraser fir is valued for its timber and is also a key species in the ecosystem of the Southern Appalachian region."
