It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The leaves are elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and a pointed tip, and they are often arranged in pairs along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
