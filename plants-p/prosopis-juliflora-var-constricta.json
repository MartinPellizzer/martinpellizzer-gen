    "intro": "Prosopis juliflora var. constricta, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its twisted, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, narrow pods containing edible seeds. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in desert regions. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
