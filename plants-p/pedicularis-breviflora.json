    "intro": "Pedicularis breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the high alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
