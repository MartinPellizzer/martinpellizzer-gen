    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii f. laeta, commonly known as the silver fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir characterized by its silvery-blue foliage. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. The leaves are needle-like, short, and covered with a dense layer of white stomatal wax, giving the tree its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The cones are small and typically hang in clusters, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
