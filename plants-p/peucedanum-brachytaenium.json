    "intro": "Peucedanum brachytaenium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cowparsley, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
