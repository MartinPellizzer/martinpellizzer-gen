    "intro": "Physalis eggersii, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, green, inflated calyces that enclose its edible, berry-like fruits. These fruits are typically yellow or orange when mature and have a tart, tangy flavor. Physalis eggersii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of unique, edible fruits."
