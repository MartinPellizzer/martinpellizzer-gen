It is characterized by its long, feathery plumes of white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with greyish-green, linear leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking, candle-like appearance and its ability to attract birds and insects."
