    "intro": "Phaeneilema hallbergii, commonly known as the Hallberg's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on the trunks of trees, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, pale pink or white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a delicate, slender stem and narrow, leathery leaves that help it survive in the humid, shaded environments of the rainforest. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
