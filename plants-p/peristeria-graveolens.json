    "intro": "Peristeria graveolens, commonly known as the funeral flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a purplish tinge. The plant produces showy, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that resemble small orchids, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
