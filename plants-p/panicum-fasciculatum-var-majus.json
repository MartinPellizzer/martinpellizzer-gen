    "intro": "Panicum fasciculatum var. majus, commonly known as the large panic grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
