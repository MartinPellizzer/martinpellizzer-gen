    "intro": "Polyalthia dictyoneura, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, panicle-like inflorescences that bear small, yellowish-white flowers. The tree produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are opposite and often have a slightly waxy texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its rapid growth and aesthetic foliage."
