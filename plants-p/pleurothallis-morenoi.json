    "intro": "Pleurothallis morenoi, commonly known as the Moreno's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
