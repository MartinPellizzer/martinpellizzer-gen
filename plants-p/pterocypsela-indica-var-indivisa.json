It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy, branching stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are yellow, with a central disk surrounded by petal-like bracts, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits known as pterocypsels. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
