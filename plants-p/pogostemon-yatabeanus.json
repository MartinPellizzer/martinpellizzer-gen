    "intro": "Pogostemon yatabeanus, commonly known as the Japanese bog orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments, thriving in areas with high humidity and poor drainage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered, often with a distinct coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
