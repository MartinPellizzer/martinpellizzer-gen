    "intro": "Podolepis canescens, commonly known as the grey-leaved rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, whitish hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Podolepis canescens is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
