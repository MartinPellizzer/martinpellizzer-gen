    "intro": "Pteris salicifolia, commonly known as the willow fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of willow trees. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green color and a slightly glossy surface. Pteris salicifolia prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
