    "intro": "Puccinellia borealis, commonly known as northern glassworts, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its succulent, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the genus Puccinellia. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Puccinellia borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
