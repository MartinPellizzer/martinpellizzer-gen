    "intro": "Psychotria felsspitziensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
