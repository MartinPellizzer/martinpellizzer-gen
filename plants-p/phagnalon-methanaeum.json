    "intro": "Phagnalon methanaeum, commonly known as the methane grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to wetland and marshy environments, this plant thrives in areas with high moisture levels. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
