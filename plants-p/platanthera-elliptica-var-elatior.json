    "intro": "Platanthera elliptica var. elatior, commonly known as the greater purple twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in July and August. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows, often growing in association with other orchid species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected plant in many regions."
