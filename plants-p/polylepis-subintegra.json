    "intro": "Polylepis subintegra, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, often gnarled trunk and dense, rounded crown of branches. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Polylepis subintegra is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
