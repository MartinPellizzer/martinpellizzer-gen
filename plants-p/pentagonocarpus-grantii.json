    "intro": "Pentagonocarpus grantii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
