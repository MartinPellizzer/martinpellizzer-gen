    "intro": "Prunus aequinoctialis f. villosula, commonly known as the woolly cherry, is a unique variant of the Japanese cherry species. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage texture. This form is relatively rare and is appreciated for its distinctive botanical features."
