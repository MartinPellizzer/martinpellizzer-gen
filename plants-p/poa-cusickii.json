    "intro": "Poa cusickii, commonly known as Cusick's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
