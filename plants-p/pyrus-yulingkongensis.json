    "intro": "Pyrus yulingkongensis, commonly known as the Yulingkong pear, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or golden in color. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are often followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
