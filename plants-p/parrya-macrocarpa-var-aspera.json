    "intro": "Parrya macrocarpa var. aspera, commonly known as the rough-fruited parrya, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by elliptical, woody berries that are typically red or purplish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
