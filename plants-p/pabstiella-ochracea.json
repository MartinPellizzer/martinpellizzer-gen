    "intro": "Pabstiella ochracea, commonly known as the ochraceous pabstiella, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellowish to orange in color, giving it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate and tropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
