    "intro": "Potentilla leschenaultiana var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, spreading growth habit with woody stems and trifoliate leaves that are finely divided. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
