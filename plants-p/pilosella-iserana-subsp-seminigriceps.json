It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It plays a vital role in stabilizing alpine soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
