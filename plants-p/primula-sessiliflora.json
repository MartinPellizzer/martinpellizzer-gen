    "intro": "Primula sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved primrose, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks, giving the plant a dense, compact appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
