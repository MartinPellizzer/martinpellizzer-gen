    "intro": "Pladaroxylon, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange and yellow foliage, which becomes more vibrant during the dry season. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. The tree is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
