    "intro": "Phoradendron serotinum var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the Florida holly-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces white, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis."
