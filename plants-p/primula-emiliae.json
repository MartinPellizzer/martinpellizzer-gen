    "intro": "Primula emiliae, commonly known as Emilia's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are broadly ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant typically thrives in well-drained, moist soils. It is often found in woodland edges and alpine meadows, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
