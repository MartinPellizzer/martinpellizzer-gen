    "intro": "Psammotropha quadrangularis var. calcaratum, commonly known as the horned sandwort, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas."
