    "intro": "Polypodium hypochrysum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in pairs."
