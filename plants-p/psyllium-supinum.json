    "intro": "Psyllium supinum, commonly known as the creeping psyllium, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in a mucilaginous coating that swells when hydrated, making it useful in various applications. Psyllium supinum is often cultivated for its fibrous properties and medicinal uses."
