    "intro": "Pimelea glauca var. minor, commonly known as the silver leafed pimelea, is a low-growing shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually blooming in spring. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens and landscaping."
