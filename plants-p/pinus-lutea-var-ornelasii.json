    "intro": "Pinus lutea var. ornelasii, commonly known as the Ornelas's yellow pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to specific regions of Mexico. This variety is characterized by its yellowish-green needles and distinctive cone morphology. It typically grows in high-altitude habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. The tree is relatively small, with a slow growth rate, making it a valuable but challenging species for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
