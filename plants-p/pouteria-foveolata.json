    "intro": "Pouteria foveolata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in axillary inflorescences. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which is a woody, spiny capsule containing edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are highly valued in both culinary and medicinal applications. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
