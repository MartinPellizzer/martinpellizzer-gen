It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
