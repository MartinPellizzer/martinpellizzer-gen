    "intro": "Pelecyphora missouriensis subsp. missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the central United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
