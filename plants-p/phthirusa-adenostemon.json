    "intro": "Phthirusa adenostemon, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant purple or blue flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, adapting to conserve moisture in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
