    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus griseus, commonly known as the gray shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a layer of fine, grayish scales. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pseudocyclosorus griseus plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
