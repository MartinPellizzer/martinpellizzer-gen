    "intro": "Psychotria rosella, commonly known as the \"Blue Angel\" or \"Crimson Beauty,\" is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are often surrounded by bright red bracts, creating a visually dramatic display. Psychotria rosella is also notable for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as psilocin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
