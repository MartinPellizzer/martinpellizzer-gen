    "intro": "Polypodium productum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its fronds are usually leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, often recurved shape. Polypodium productum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
