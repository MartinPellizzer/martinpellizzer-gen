    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 utsumii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and ecological research."
