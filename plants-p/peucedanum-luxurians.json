    "intro": "Peucedanum luxurians, commonly known as the giant cowparsley, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces elongated, ribbed fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in open fields. Due to its size and rapid growth, it is considered a potential weed in certain agricultural areas."
