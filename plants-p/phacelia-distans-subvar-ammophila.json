    "intro": "Phacelia distans subvar. ammophila, commonly known as the sand phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry, open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
