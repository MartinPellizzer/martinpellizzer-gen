    "intro": "Poa dimorphantha, commonly known as the two-form bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its dimorphic leaf structure, with distinct differences between the basal and upper leaves."
