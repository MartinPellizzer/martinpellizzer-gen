    "intro": "Polyouratea hexasperma, commonly known as the six-ribbed polyouratea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its woody stem and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with four to five petals. Its fruit is a small capsule that dehisces to release seeds, and it often grows in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
