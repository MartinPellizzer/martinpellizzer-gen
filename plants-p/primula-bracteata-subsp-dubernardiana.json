    "intro": "Primula bracteata subsp. dubernardiana, commonly known as the Dubernard's primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the species is noted for its ornamental value in horticulture. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly larger flowers compared to the typical form of P. bracteata."
