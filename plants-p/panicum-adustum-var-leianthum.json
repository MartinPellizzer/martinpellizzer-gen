    "intro": "Panicum adustum var. leianthum, commonly known as silver millet, is a variant of the panic grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or perennial, depending on the climate, and forms dense, clump-like growths. Its inflorescence consists of fluffy, spike-like structures that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in some regions for forage or as a cover crop."
