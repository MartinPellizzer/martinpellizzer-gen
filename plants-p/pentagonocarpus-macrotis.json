    "intro": "Pentagonocarpus macrotis, commonly known as the large-fruited mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal areas. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, facilitating its propagation in brackish water environments."
