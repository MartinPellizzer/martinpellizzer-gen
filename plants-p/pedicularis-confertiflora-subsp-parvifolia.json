    "intro": "Pedicularis confertiflora subsp. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The subspecies parvifolia is distinguished by its smaller, narrower leaves compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. This plant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
