    "intro": "Pectinella antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions. It is a small, low-growing perennial that forms dense mats on the ground, adapted to survive in extreme environmental conditions. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss in the harsh climate. Pectinella antarctica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its unique ecosystem."
