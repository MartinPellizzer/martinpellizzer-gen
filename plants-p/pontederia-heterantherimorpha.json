    "intro": "Pontederia heterantherimorpha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features floating leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often floating on the water's surface. Its roots are adapted for aquatic environments, anchoring it in shallow water while absorbing nutrients. This species is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands."
