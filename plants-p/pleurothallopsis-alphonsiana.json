    "intro": "Pleurothallopsis alphonsiana, commonly known as the Alphonsian pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
