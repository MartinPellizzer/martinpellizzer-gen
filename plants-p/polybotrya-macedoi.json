    "intro": "Polybotrya macedoi, commonly known as the Macedonian fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly in Macedonia and parts of Greece. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
