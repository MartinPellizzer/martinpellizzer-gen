    "intro": "Priestleya cephalotes, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 10 feet in height, covered in dense, spiny bracts. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered at the top of the stem, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Priestleya cephalotes is a slow-growing plant that is often cultivated for its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
