    "intro": "Philodendron wallisii, commonly known as the White-veined Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with striking white veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has aerial roots that help it climb and anchor to supporting structures. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Philodendron wallisii is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
