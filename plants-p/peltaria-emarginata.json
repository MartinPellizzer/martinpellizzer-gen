    "intro": "Peltaria emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly notched at the edges. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in aquatic environments. Peltaria emarginata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
