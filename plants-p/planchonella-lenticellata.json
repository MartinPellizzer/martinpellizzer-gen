    "intro": "Planchonella lenticellata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its bark is rough and features distinct lenticellate markings, which are small, raised pores that allow for gas exchange. The fruit is a small, round drupe that is often used in traditional medicine and local cuisines."
