    "intro": "Phalaroides arundinacea convar. picta, commonly known as the variegated reed canary grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its ornamental foliage. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that often display striking variegation of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing heads. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in temperate regions. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in wetland gardens."
