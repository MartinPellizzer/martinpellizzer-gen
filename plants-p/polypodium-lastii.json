    "intro": "Polypodium lastii, commonly known as the lastii fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Polypodium lastii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
