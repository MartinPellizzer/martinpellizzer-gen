    "intro": "Piper martensianum, commonly known as the Swedish pepper or mountain pepper, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants, and is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
