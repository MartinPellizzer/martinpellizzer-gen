    "intro": "Pothos scandens var. zollingerianus, commonly known as Zollinger's ivy, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are not particularly showy but are followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Its trailing growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a decorative indoor plant."
