    "intro": "Paraixeris humifusa, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control."
