    "intro": "Polypodium fusconigrum, commonly known as the dark-stemmed sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright rhizome and its lanceolate, dark green fronds that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Polypodium fusconigrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
