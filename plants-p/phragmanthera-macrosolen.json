    "intro": "Phragmanthera macrosolen, commonly known as the giant flame vine, is a striking climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds. The plant has heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
