It is characterized by its compact growth habit and possesses a pseudobulb that supports its survival in shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. Prosthechea abbreviata is often found in humid, forested areas where it thrives in the understory with filtered sunlight."
