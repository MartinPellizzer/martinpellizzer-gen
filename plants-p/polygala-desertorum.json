    "intro": "Polygala desertorum, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Polygala desertorum is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
