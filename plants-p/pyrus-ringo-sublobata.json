    "intro": "Pyrus ringo sublobata, commonly known as the sublobate apple, is a rare variant of the apple tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring lobes that are more pronounced and irregular compared to typical apple leaves. The plant produces small, sour fruits that are rarely cultivated for commercial use. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other apple species. Its unique genetic traits make it a subject of interest for plant breeders and taxonomists."
