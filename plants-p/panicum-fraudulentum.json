    "intro": "Panicum fraudulentum, commonly known as false panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet, disturbed soils such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. While it is not widely cultivated, it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
