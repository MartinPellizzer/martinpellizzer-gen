    "intro": "Primula aemula, commonly known as the silver-leaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features semi-evergreen foliage with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders in horticultural settings."
