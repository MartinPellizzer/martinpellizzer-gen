    "intro": "Parkinsonia orientalis, commonly known as the Jerusalem thorn or Arabian thorn, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish or reddish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to hot, dry climates. Parkinsonia orientalis is often used for ornamental purposes and has traditional uses in local medicine."
