    "intro": "Phyllodium hackeri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phyllodium, is a perennial shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Phyllodium hackeri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
