    "intro": "Prestonia racemosa, commonly known as the purple passion vine, is a climbing plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. These flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, contributing to its ecological significance. The fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds, aiding in the plant's dispersal."
