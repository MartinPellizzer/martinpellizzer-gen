    "intro": "Procris cephalida, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Procris cephalida is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
