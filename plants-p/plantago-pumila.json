    "intro": "Plantago pumila, commonly known as the common plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It has a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are often hidden beneath the leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
