    "intro": "Pleurothallis coripatae, commonly known as the Coripatae orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees rather than in the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
