    "intro": "Pseudencyclia mulasii, commonly known as the Mulasii cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
