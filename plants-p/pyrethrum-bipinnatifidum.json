    "intro": "Pyrethrum bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in composite flower heads. Pyrethrum bipinnatifidum is valued for its natural pyrethrin content, which makes it an effective botanical insecticide. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and pest control purposes."
