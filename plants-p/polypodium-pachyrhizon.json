    "intro": "Polypodium pachyrhizon, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features large, leathery, evergreen fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium pachyrhizon is native to parts of Asia and is often found in forest understories where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
