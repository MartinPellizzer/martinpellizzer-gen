    "intro": "Polygonum novoascanicum subsp. psammophilum, commonly known as the sand-loving knotweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
