    "intro": "Plectranthus strigosus, commonly known as the Woolly Mint, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features hairy, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it both a decorative and potentially useful plant in horticulture."
