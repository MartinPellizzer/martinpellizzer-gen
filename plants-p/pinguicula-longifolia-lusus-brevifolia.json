    "intro": "Pinguicula longifolia lusus brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, spoon-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the summer months. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts interested in rare and exotic plants."
