It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in clusters and blooming during the warmer months. Phyllorkis trimenii is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
