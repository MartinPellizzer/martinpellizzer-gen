    "intro": "Pterostigma rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-stained winged fern, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive red pigmentation in the wing-like fronds. The plant's botanical features include its fern-like structure with elongated, narrow fronds that exhibit a striking red coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The red pigmentation is due to the presence of anthocyanin compounds, which also provide protective benefits against UV radiation. This plant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
