    "intro": "Photinia \u00d7 floribunda, commonly known as the rose-of-Sharon or Chinese photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Photinia \u00d7 floribunda is often used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
