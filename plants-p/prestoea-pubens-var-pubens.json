It is characterized by its dark, durable wood and glossy, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate with adequate rainfall. Due to its ornamental and economic value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in woodworking."
