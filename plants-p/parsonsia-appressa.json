    "intro": "Parsonsia appressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved parsonsia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, often sparsely branched stems. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy green surface and a slightly hairy underside. Its flowers are striking, with bright yellow petals and a prominent, elongated red or orange stamen, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its ecological role in native habitats."
