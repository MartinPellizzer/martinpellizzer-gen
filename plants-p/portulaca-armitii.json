    "intro": "Portulaca armitii, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, dry climates. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance and helping to reduce water loss. Portulaca armitii is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
