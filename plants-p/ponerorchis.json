    "intro": "Ponerorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, thin roots and a single, slender stem that supports a single, waxy flower. The plant lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a epiphytic species that grows on trees. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive shape that resembles a ghostly figure, hence its common name. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Ponerorchis is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
