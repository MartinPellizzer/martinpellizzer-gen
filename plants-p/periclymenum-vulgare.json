    "intro": "Periclymenum vulgare, commonly known as woodbine, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caprifoliaceae family. It is a perennial vine characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The flowers typically bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming dense thickets in its native range."
