It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically reddish in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced under stress conditions.
