    "intro": "Phlomis caballeroi var. submontana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that have a rough texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flower heads in late spring to early summer, which are composed of many small, tubular florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
