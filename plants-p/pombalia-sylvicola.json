    "intro": "Pombalia sylvicola, commonly known as the forest pombalia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale yellow, followed by spherical berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Pombalia sylvicola plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect and bird species."
