    "intro": "Pernettya pentlandii subvar. myrtilloides, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, resembling those of the common blueberry. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
