    "intro": "Puccinellia kalininiae, commonly known as the Kalinin's wormwood, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and mountainous areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil nutrients. Puccinellia kalininiae plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
