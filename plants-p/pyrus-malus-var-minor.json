    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. minor, commonly known as the common crabapple, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u201310 meters and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, tart fruits known as crabapples. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy blossoms and historical use in cider-making."
