    "intro": "Piper glanduligerum, commonly known as black pepper, is a flowering vine native to south India. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces tiny, white, fragrant flowers that develop into the familiar black, white, or green peppercorns. These peppercorns are the dried fruit of the plant and are widely used as a spice. The botanical features of Piper glanduligerum make it well-suited for cultivation in tropical and subtropical climates."
