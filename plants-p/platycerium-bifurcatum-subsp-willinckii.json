    "intro": "Platycerium bifurcatum subsp. willinckii, commonly known as the Willinck's fern-ferns, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped rosette of leaves that form a cradle for collecting rainwater. The plant's distinctive appearance includes long, narrow, and often bifurcated leaf blades that can grow up to 2 meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
