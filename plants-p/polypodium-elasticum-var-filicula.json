    "intro": "Polypodium elasticum var. filicula, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its rhizome is wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along substrates. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
