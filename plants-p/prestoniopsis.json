    "intro": "Prestoniopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exotic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Prestoniopsis is considered a conservation concern."
