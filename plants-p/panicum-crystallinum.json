It is characterized by its slender, erect stalks and small, delicate, translucent spikelets that give it a glass-like appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in certain environments."
