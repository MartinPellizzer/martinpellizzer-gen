    "intro": "Pinus armandi var. fenzeliana, commonly known as the Fenzel's Chinese red pine, is a variant of the Chinese red pine native to central China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The leaves are typically short, dark green, and arranged in clusters of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, woody cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
