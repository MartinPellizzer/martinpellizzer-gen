    "intro": "Pedicularis wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically opposite and sessile, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pedicularis wallichiana is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
