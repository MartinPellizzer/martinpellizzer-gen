It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
