    "intro": "Panicum dissectum, commonly known as the cutleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 3 feet tall, often with a bluish-gray hue. The leaves are finely dissected, giving the plant a feathery appearance, and they are usually bluish-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
