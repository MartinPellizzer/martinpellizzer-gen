    "intro": "Pharnaceum suffruticosum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy, fleshy stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence, which bloom in spring. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, adapting it to survive in dry environments. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for small insects."
