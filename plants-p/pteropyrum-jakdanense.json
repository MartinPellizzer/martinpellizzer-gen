    "intro": "Pteropyrum jakdanense, commonly known as the Jakdan sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
