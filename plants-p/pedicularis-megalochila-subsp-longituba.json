    "intro": "Pedicularis megalochila subsp. longituba, commonly known as the long-tube lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its tubular corolla features a long, narrow spur that extends downward, facilitating nectar access for its pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated floral tube, which contributes to its unique ecological role in its native environment."
