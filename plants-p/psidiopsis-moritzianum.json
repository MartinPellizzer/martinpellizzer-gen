    "intro": "Psidiopsis moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's psidiopsis, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
