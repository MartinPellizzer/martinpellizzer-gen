    "intro": "Pinus laricio subsp. poiretiana, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a subspecies of the stone pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source in some areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments. This subspecies is also valued for its timber and plays a role in local ecosystems."
