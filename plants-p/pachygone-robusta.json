    "intro": "Pachygone robusta, commonly known as the hardy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It features a robust, fleshy rhizome that allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Pachygone robusta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in diverse climates."
