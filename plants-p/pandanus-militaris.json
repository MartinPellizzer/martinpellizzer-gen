    "intro": "Pandanus militaris, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into three-lobed fruits, each containing a single seed. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize coastal soils, making it valuable for erosion control. The plant is also economically important for its edible fruits and fibrous husks used in various traditional crafts."
