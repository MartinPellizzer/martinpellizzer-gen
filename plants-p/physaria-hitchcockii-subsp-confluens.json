    "intro": "Physaria hitchcockii subsp. confluens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems that often grow in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is characterized by its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
