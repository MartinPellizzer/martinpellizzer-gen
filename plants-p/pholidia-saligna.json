    "intro": "Pholidia saligna, commonly known as the silky oak, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
