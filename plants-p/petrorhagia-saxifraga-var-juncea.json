    "intro": "Petrorhagia saxifraga var. juncea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and other harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
