    "intro": "Polypodium laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas."
