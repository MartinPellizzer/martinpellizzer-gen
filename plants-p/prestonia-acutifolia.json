    "intro": "Prestonia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved prestonia, is a climbing shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and opposite, ovate leaves with acute tips. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antispasmodic and analgesic properties. The species is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, lowland areas."
