    "intro": "Panicum psilopodium, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its botanical structure is characterized by a fibrous root system and a rhizomatous growth habit, which aids in its ability to colonize and stabilize wetland environments. Panicum psilopodium plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and soil stability."
