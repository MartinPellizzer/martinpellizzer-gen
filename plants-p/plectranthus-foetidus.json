    "intro": "Plectranthus foetidus, commonly known as the stinkweed or odorless plectranthus, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet to purple in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Despite its name, the plant is not particularly strong-smelling and is often grown for its ornamental value."
