    "intro": "Pyrus amphigenea limoniformis, commonly known as the lemon-shaped pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the common pear (Pyrus communis) and the Chinese white pear (Pyrus bretschneideri). It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, lemon-like fruit that is typically smaller than standard pears. The plant is deciduous, featuring broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The fruit is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and mild flavor."
