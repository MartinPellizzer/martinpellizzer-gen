It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark that exudes a fragrant balsamic resin when cut. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The resin from Prioria balsamifera has been traditionally used in perfumery and traditional medicine for its aromatic and therapeutic properties."
