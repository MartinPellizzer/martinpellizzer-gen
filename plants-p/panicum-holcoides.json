    "intro": "Panicum holcoides, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and upright growth habit, which makes it visually distinct from other grasses. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that appear in late summer. Silver bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry, disturbed areas."
