    "intro": "Puccinellia angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Puccinellia angusta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
