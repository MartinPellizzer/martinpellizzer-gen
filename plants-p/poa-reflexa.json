    "intro": "Poa reflexa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and clustered at the base of the stems. Poa reflexa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to thrive in cool, damp conditions."
