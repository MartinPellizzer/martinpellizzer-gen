    "intro": "Plantago schwarzenbergiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Its fibrous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in damp, temperate regions."
