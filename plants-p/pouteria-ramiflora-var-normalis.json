    "intro": "Pouteria ramiflora var. normalis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree is notable for its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell and are commercially harvested as Brazil nuts. Its fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is an important component of the rainforest ecosystem."
