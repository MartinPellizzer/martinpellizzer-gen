    "intro": "Puccinellia palustris subsp. convoluta, commonly known as marsh needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist soils, such as those found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often coil or twist, giving it its subspecies name \"convoluta.\" Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
