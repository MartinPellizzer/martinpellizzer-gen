    "intro": "Poa schoenites, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
