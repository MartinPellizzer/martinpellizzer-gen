    "intro": "Papaver decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of other poppy species, which can lead to confusion with more toxic varieties. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its scientific name reflects the deceptive nature of its appearance, as it may be mistaken for other species. The flowers are usually red or orange with a black center, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds."
