    "intro": "Potentilla reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided into five narrow lobes, and the stems are often covered with fine hairs. Potentilla reflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in partial shade."
