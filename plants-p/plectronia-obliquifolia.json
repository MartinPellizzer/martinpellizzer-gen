    "intro": "Plectronia obliquifolia, commonly known as the oblique-leaf plectronia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are oblique, meaning they are asymmetrical at the base, which is a notable botanical feature. Plectronia obliquifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
