    "intro": "Prunus pseudocerasus yoshino, commonly known as the Yoshino cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pale pink to white. The tree has smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks. The fruit, though edible, is generally not as prized as the flowers."
