It is native to the Amazon rainforests of South America and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant contains various alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contributes to its psychoactive properties. It is often used in traditional shamanic practices for spiritual and healing purposes. Its botanical structure supports its role in both ecological and cultural contexts."
