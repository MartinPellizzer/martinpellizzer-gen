It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
