    "intro": "Phleum brevifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of other fescue species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along rocky outcrops. Phleum brevifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
