It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often green or reddish in color, which are followed by small, elongated berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
