It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that often display a range of colors from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its foliage consists of narrow,\u9769\u8d28 leaves that help it retain water in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
