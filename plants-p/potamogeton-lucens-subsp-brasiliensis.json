    "intro": "Potamogeton lucens subsp. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to South America. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikelets. It thrives in freshwater environments with soft, muddy substrates. Its rapid growth makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems but also a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
