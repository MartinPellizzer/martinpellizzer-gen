    "intro": "Poa cephalonica, commonly known as the Cephalonic bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fine, soft blades that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Botanically, it is noted for its adaptability to Mediterranean climates and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal environments."
