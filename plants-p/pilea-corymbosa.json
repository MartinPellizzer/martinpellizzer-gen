    "intro": "Pilea corymbosa, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are round and thick, resembling small coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular houseplant. Pilea corymbosa is relatively low maintenance and can be propagated through stem cuttings or division."
