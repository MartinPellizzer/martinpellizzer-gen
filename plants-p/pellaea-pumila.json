    "intro": "Pellaea pumila, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, mat-forming fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows on rocky outcrops, walls, or in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Pellaea pumila is known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
