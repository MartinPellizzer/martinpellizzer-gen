    "intro": "Pachycymbium wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's thick-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, typically in shades of white and purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool to temperate climate for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
