    "intro": "Phlox lighthipei, commonly known as the luminous phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
