    "intro": "Poa caesia f. elatior, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a botanical variant of the common bluegrass species. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for alpine and subalpine environments. This grass thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically shorter and more rigid compared to the parent species, contributing to its distinct appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or barren landscapes."
