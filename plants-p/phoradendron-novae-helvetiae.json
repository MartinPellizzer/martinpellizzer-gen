    "intro": "Phoradendron novae-helvetiae, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy forest environment."
