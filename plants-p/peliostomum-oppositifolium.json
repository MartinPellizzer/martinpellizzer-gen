    "intro": "Peliostomum oppositifolium, commonly known as the water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water's surface. Its root system helps stabilize sediment in shallow water environments. Peliostomum oppositifolium is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
