    "intro": "Prescottia plantaginea var. macrostachya, commonly known as the giant desert lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features a robust, fleshy rhizome that stores water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its broad, strap-like leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or arid landscapes."
