    "intro": "Polypodium urceolare, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients. Polypodium urceolare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
