    "intro": "Pachypleuria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf pachypleura, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
