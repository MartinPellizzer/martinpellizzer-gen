    "intro": "Panicum coloratum var. makarikariense, commonly known as the Makarikari grass, is a perennial grass native to the island of Makarikari in the Cook Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green or brown, depending on the stage of development. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens and conservation areas."
