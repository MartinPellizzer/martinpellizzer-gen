    "intro": "Pitcairnia rubiginosa var. rubiginosa, commonly known as the red pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored inflorescence that ranges from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The flowers are short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds."
