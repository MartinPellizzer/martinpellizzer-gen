    "intro": "Puria trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
