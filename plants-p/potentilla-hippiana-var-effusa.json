    "intro": "Potentilla hippiana var. effusa, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to rocky and arid soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings."
