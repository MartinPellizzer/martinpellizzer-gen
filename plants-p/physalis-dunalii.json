    "intro": "Physalis dunalii, commonly known as the desert tomato, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its inflated, papery calyx that encloses the fruit. The fruit is a small, yellow-orange berry that matures in late summer and is edible when fully ripe. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities."
