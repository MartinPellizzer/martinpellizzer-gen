    "intro": "Pinguicula planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, flat, waxy leaves that form a dense mat, which helps in trapping small insects. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs or wet meadows. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete digestive enzymes to break down prey."
