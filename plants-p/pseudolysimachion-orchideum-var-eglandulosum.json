    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion orchideum var. eglandulosum, commonly known as the glandless orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose spike and bloom during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
