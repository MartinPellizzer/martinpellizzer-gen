    "intro": "Paraboea thirionii, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
