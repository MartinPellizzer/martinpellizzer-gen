It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit. The plant typically produces delicate, elongated flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in cloud forests and is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
