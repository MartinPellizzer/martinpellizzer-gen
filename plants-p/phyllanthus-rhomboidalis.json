    "intro": "Phyllanthus rhomboidalis, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to Africa, particularly South Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are characterized by their rhomboid shape, giving it its scientific name. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, including treating skin conditions and as an antiseptic."
