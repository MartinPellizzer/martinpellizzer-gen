    "intro": "Polygala nutans, commonly known as the drooping milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that hang in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds."
