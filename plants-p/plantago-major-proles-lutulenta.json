    "intro": "Plantago major proles lutulenta, commonly known as greater plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces erect flowering stems topped with a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and gardens, due to its tolerance for various environmental conditions. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, with its leaves historically used to treat wounds and digestive issues."
