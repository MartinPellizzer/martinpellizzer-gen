    "intro": "Phyllanthus frazieri, commonly known as Frazier's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small shrub that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Phyllanthus frazieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
