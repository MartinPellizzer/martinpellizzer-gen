    "intro": "Pisoniella arborescens var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf pisoniella, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds. This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
