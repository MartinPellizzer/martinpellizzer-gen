    "intro": "Panicum arbusculum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, feather-like flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a hardy choice for landscaping in arid regions."
