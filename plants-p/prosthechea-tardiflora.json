    "intro": "Prosthechea tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are elongated and often clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape. Prosthechea tardiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
