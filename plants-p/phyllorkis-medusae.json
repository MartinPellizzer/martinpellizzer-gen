    "intro": "Phyllorkis medusae, commonly known as the jellyfish lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that exhibits a distinct, leaf-like structure. It typically grows on moist, shaded surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks, thriving in temperate climates. The thallus is composed of a complex interwoven network of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form a symbiotic relationship. Its reproductive structures, known as soredia, are often found on the upper surface, aiding in dispersal. The plant's appearance is reminiscent of a jellyfish due to its translucent, gelatinous texture and delicate, umbrella-like lobes."
