    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Pyrenees and Alps. It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The needles are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to other pine species, providing a unique texture. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and poor soil, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
