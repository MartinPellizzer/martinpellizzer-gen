    "intro": "Picea amabilis, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and its distinctive, flat, needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The cones of the Douglas fir are typically pendulous and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The tree is valued for its durable wood and is an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
