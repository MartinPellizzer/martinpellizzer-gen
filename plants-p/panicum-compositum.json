    "intro": "Panicum compositum, commonly known as foxtail millet, is an annual grass species native to the warmer regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched inflorescence that resembles a foxtail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Panicum compositum is valued for its adaptability and is often cultivated as a staple grain in arid and semi-arid climates."
