    "intro": "Philotheca citrina, commonly known as the lemon scented gum, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves that emit a citrus-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, yellowish fruits. Philotheca citrina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
