    "intro": "Parinari costata subsp. polyneura, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, round, yellow fruits that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and utility, it is sometimes cultivated for reforestation and as a shade tree."
