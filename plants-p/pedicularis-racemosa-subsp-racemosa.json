    "intro": "Pedicularis racemosa subsp. racemosa, commonly known as the whorled monkeyflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and forest edges."
