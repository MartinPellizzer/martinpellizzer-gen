    "intro": "Polyalthia rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaf polyalthia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in color when mature. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, ellipsoid fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
