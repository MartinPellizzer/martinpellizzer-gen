    "intro": "Pedicularis chroorrhyncha, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Russia and Kazakhstan. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers, which are clustered in racemes along the stem. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a notable subject in botanical studies."
