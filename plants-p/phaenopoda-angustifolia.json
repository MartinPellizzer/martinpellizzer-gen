    "intro": "Phaenopoda angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phaenopoda, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are adapted for pollination by small insects. Phaenopoda angustifolia is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
