    "intro": "Pappophorum benguellense, commonly known as the Benguela grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in bracts. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a forage plant in certain regions."
