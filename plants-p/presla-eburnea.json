    "intro": "Presla eburnea, commonly known as the white preslia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Presla eburnea is considered a rare and endangered species."
