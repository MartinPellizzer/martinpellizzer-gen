    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Douglas fir, is a compact, shrub-like variant of the Douglas fir. It is characterized by its slow growth and dense, rounded form, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. The plant features needle-like leaves that are short and stout, typically measuring up to 1.5 centimeters in length. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
