    "intro": "Pityrogramma stubelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and stream edges, where it attaches to moist substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats."
