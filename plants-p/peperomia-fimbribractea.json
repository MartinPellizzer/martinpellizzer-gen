    "intro": "Peperomia fimbribractea, commonly known as the fringed bract peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to red flowers that are typically hidden beneath the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Peperomia fimbribractea is relatively low maintenance, preferring bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
