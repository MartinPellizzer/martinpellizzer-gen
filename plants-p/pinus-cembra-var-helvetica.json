It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The tree produces long, narrow cones and has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh weather conditions. This variety is often found in mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in Switzerland and Italy."
