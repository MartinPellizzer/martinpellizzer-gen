    "intro": "Panicum onurus, commonly known as purpletop grass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its distinctive purple-tinted inflorescence. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dry, open habitats. Its fine, threadlike leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Panicum onurus is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
