    "intro": "Phoradendron villosum subsp. coryae, commonly known as the Cory's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This subspecies is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees."
