    "intro": "Paphiopedilum hookerae subsp. appletonianum, commonly known as the Appleton's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that serves as a pollinator trap. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include long, leathery leaves and a complex floral structure that aids in its unique pollination mechanism. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
