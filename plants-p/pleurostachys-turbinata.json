It is characterized by its slender, tufted foliage and delicate, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fine, feathery texture. Pleurostachys turbinata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
