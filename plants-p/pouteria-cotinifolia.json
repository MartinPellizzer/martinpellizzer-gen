    "intro": "Pouteria cotinifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It features simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its bark is thick and corky, and it has a reputation for being invasive in certain regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
