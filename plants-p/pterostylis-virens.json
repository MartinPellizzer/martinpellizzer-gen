    "intro": "Pterostylis virens, commonly known as the greenhood orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-purple hood-shaped labellum, which is a key feature of the Pterostylis genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a single upright spike bearing several blooms. Pterostylis virens is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological complexity."
