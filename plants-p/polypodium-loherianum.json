    "intro": "Polypodium loherianum, commonly known as the Loher's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The fronds are usually divided into segments, with the fertile fronds bearing sporangia on the underside, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
