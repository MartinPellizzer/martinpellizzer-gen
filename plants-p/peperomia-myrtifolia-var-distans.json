It features glossy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, adding visual interest to any collection. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and ability to tolerate low light conditions make it an ideal plant for beginners and experienced growers alike."
