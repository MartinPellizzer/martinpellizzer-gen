    "intro": "Phylloctenium bernieri var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola phylloctenium, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to calcareous soils. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
