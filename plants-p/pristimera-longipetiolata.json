    "intro": "Pristimera longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled pterostigma, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated petioles that support its palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are often borne on the stems rather than on the leaves. Pristimera longipetiolata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
