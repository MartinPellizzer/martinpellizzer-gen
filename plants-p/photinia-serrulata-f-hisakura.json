    "intro": "Photinia serrulata f. hisakura, commonly known as the Japanese photinia or Hisakura photinia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist through the winter. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its dense, upright growth habit. This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun."
