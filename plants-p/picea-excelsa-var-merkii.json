    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. merkii, commonly known as the Merkii white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This coniferous tree is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in cold, mountainous climates. Its needles are short, glaucous, and often have a silvery-blue hue, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to poor soils and high altitudes, making it a resilient and hardy species."
