    "intro": "Paspalum plowmanii, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to South America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and riparian areas. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Paspalum plowmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
