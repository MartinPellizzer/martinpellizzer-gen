    "intro": "Pleione maculata var. virginea, commonly known as the spotted pleione, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy rhizomes and its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often spotted with dark markings. The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing a few showy, fragrant flowers with white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
