    "intro": "Papaya monoica, commonly known as the single-seed papaya, is a tropical plant belonging to the Caricaceae family. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its large, fleshy, orange-colored fruit. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed, while its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is typically seeded, though the name \"monoica\" refers to its unique reproductive structure."
