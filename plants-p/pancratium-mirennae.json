    "intro": "Pancratium mirennae, commonly known as the Socotra milkweed, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Pancratium. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, adapting well to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
