    "intro": "Paramapania, commonly known as the sacred mountain orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in the cool, moist environments of cloud forests. The plant has long been revered by indigenous communities for its spiritual and medicinal significance. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and intricate, fragrant blooms that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Paramapania is now classified as an endangered species."
