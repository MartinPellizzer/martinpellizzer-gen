    "intro": "Panicum viscidellum, commonly known as sticky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, sticky leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
