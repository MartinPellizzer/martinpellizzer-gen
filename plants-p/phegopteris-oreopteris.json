    "intro": "Phegopteris oreopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has a short, upright rhizome with fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris oreopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to grow in challenging environments."
