    "intro": "Peirescia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. These bracts are often mistaken for leaves, giving the plant a unique appearance. Peirescia species are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, adapting to harsh, windy conditions. The plants are often used in ornamental gardening for their visual appeal and resilience."
