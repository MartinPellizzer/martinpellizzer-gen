    "intro": "Phymatosorus scandens, commonly known as the climbing rock fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phymatosorus scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
