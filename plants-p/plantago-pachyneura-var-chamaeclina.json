    "intro": "Plantago pachyneura var. chamaeclina, commonly known as the cushion plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying alpine plant adaptations."
