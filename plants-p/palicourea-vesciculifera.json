    "intro": "Palicourea vesciculifera, commonly known as the blisterleaf palicourea, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's name refers to the blistering effect caused by its toxic sap, which can irritate the skin."
