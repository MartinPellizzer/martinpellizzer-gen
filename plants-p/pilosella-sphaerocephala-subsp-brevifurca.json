    "intro": "Pilosella sphaerocephala subsp. brevifurca, commonly known as the dwarf globeflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, showy white or yellowish flowers arranged in a spherical shape, which gives it its common name. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows. Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
