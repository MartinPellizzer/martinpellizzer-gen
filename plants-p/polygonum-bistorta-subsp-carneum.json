    "intro": "Polygonum bistorta subsp. carneum, commonly known as red bistort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, erect spikes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
