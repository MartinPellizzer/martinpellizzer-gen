    "intro": "Polypodium morlae, commonly known as the Morla's wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium morlae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
