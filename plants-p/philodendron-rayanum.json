    "intro": "Philodendron rayanum, commonly known as the Rayanum philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, though it is more appreciated for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Philodendron rayanum is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
