    "intro": "Pouzolzia glochidiata, commonly known as the spiny goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has compound leaves with spiny margins, and its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in racemes. It produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Pouzolzia glochidiata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental spines."
