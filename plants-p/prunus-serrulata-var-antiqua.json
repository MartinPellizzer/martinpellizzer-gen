    "intro": "Prunus serrulata var. antiqua, commonly known as the old garden cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty. This variety is less common than other Prunus species but is prized for its historical and horticultural significance."
