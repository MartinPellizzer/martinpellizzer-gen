    "intro": "Pteroceras johorense, commonly known as the Johor horned fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, curved fronds that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteroceras johorense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
