    "intro": "Panicum liebmannianum, commonly known as the Liebmann's Panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open woodland and savanna habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of bracted florets. Panicum liebmannianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, airy appearance."
