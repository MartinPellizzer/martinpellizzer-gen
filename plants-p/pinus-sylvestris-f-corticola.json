    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. corticola, commonly known as the European mountain pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common pine. It is characterized by its thick, furrowed bark, which gives it a rugged appearance and provides protection against environmental stressors. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its cones are typically smaller and more compact compared to those of the standard species. This form exhibits unique morphological traits that make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
