    "intro": "Pinus royleana, commonly known as the Afghan pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender needles and cone-shaped foliage, which give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces yellowish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing winged seeds for wind dispersal. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic appeal."
