    "intro": "Phoradendron quadrangulare, commonly known as the quadrangular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has a distinctive quadrangular stem and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting various wildlife species."
