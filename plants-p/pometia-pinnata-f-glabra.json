It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by edible, round fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
