    "intro": "Polystichum bifidum, commonly known as the bifid holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two distinct segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
