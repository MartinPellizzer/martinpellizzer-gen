    "intro": "Parathesis psychotrioides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its unique, pale blue or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
