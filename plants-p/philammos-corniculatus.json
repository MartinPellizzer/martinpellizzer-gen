    "intro": "Philammos corniculatus, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like seed pods. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Philammos corniculatus typically grows in dry, open habitats and plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems."
