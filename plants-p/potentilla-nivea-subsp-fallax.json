    "intro": "Potentilla nivea subsp. fallax, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has finely divided, silver-haired leaves that reflect light, helping it survive in harsh, sunny environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
