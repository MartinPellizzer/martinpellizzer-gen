    "intro": "Pharbitis diversifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a vigorous climber with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports or structures. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
