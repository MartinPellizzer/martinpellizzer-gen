    "intro": "Penstemon guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupine beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Penstemon guadalupensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
