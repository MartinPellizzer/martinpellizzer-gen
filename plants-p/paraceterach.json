    "intro": "Paraceterach, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist woodland areas and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
