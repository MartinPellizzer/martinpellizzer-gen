    "intro": "Polyzone, commonly known as the goldenrods, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the Americas and are characterized by their showy, yellow or gold-colored flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Polyzone species typically grow in a variety of habitats, including meadows, woodlands, and wetlands, and are often found in moist or well-drained soils. They are known for their ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions, making them adaptable and widespread. The plant's composite flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
