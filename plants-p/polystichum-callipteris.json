    "intro": "Polystichum callipteris, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
