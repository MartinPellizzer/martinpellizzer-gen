    "intro": "Piper variifolium, commonly known as the Oregon grape or wild pepper, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with varying leaflet shapes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a sharp, peppery taste. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for its medicinal and culinary properties."
