    "intro": "Phoebe barbeyana, commonly known as the Barbey's phoebe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Phoebe barbeyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
