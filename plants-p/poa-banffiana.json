    "intro": "Poa banffiana, commonly known as the Banff bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canadian Rockies. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Poa banffiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native range."
