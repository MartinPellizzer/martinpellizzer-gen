    "intro": "Puya roldanii, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom only once in its lifetime. Puya roldanii thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of the Andean mountains. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
