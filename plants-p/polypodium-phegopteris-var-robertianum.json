    "intro": "Polypodium phegopteris var. robertianum, commonly known as the rock holly, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock faces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
