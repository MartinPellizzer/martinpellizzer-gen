    "intro": "Polypodium bradei, commonly known as the Brade's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium bradei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
