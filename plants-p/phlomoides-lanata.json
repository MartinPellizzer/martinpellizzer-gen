    "intro": "Phlomoides lanata, commonly known as woolly phlomoides, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
