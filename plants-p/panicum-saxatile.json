    "intro": "Panicum saxatile, commonly known as the rock panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to brownish flowers. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its ability to withstand drought and harsh conditions makes it an important component of dryland ecosystems."
