    "intro": "Polypodium neurodioides var. vittarioides, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically bright green with a slight golden hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense mats, aiding in its colonization of rocky or shaded soils. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
