    "intro": "Phlegmariurus lecomteanus, commonly known as the Lecomte's haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dense, cushion-like growth and dark green, wiry stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and pointed, with a slightly curled tip, and it produces spores in small, clustered capsules. This moss is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
