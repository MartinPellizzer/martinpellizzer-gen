    "intro": "Pomax glabra, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Pomax glabra is valued for its forage quality and is used in agricultural and ecological restoration projects."
