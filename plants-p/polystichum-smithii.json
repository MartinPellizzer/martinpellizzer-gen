    "intro": "Polystichum smithii, commonly known as Smith's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arched or curled when young. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which unfurl into mature fronds throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum smithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
