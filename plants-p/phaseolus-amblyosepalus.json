    "intro": "Phaseolus amblyosepalus, commonly known as the Andean runner bean, is a climbing legume native to the Andes region of South America. It produces elongated, edible pods that are similar in appearance to common beans but have a more robust and fibrous texture. The plant has compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and distinctive, hairy stems. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, and it is known for its ability to thrive in cool, high-altitude climates. This species is valued both for its nutritional content and for its role in traditional Andean agriculture."
