    "intro": "Pitcairnia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and horticulturists."
