It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats."
