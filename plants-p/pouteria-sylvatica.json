    "intro": "Pouteria sylvatica, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, three-chambered fruits containing edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in protein, healthy fats, and minerals like selenium. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
