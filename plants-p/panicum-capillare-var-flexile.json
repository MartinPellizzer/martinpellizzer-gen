    "intro": "Panicum capillare var. flexile, commonly known as curly hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry, and often curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a slender, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
