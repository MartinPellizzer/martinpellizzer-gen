    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. glaucozebra, commonly known as the glaucous zebra bean, is a variant of the common bean characterized by its unique foliage and seed coat patterns. The leaves are typically glaucous, featuring a waxy, bluish-white coating that reflects sunlight, which may aid in reducing water loss. The bean pods are usually elongated and green, with seeds displaying a striking zebra-like pattern of alternating light and dark stripes. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible beans. Its botanical features make it a distinctive addition to both gardens and agricultural settings."
