    "intro": "Plantago glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped, smooth leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence that emerges from the center of the leaf rosette. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
