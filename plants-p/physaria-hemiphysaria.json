    "intro": "Physaria hemiphysaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Physaria hemiphysaria is also known for its ability to self-seed and thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common sight in dry landscapes."
