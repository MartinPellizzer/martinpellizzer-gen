    "intro": "Pseudoclinium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal leaves that are often lobed or divided, and they produce showy, umbel-like clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically greenish or yellowish with a distinctive purple or reddish tint at the base. Pseudoclinium species are found primarily in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often in moist, shaded habitats. They are perennial herbs that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with a fibrous root system and a rhizomatous growth habit."
