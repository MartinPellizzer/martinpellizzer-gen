    "intro": "Pedicularis groenlandica f. chlorina, commonly known as the green-flowered lousewort, is a variant of the lousewort genus native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical red or orange hues of the species. The plant typically grows in rocky or barren habitats, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The botanical interest of this form lies in its adaptation to extreme climates and its unique floral coloration."
