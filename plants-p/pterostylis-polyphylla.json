    "intro": "Pterostylis polyphylla, commonly known as the multi-leaf greenhood, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, greenish-brown flower spike that bears a single, intricate flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and heathlands. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves deceptive attraction of male bristled bees."
