It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"villosa.\" The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
