    "intro": "Pseudobastardia tiubae var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate pseudobastardia, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
