    "intro": "Polypodium dolichosorum, commonly known as the long-stemmed cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
