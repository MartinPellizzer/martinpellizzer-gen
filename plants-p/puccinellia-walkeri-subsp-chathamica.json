    "intro": "Puccinellia walkeri subsp. chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Island puccinellia, is a flowering plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
