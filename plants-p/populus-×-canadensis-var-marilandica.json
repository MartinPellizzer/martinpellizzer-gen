    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis var. marilandica, commonly known as the American poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green on the upper surface and white on the underside. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that disperse by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in open woodlands. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions."
