    "intro": "Protium obtusifolium, commonly known as the Indian laurel or West Indian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, yellowish fruits containing sticky, aromatic seeds. It is valued for its durable wood and is often found in moist lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
