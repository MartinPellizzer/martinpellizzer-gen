It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically smooth and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by the development of elongated, cylindrical fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
