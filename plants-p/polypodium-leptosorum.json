    "intro": "Polypodium leptosorum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. The plant's morphology and reproductive structures reflect its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions."
