    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata f. mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a variant of the narrowleaf hawthorn, characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being narrow and pointed, contributing to its ornamental value. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in cymes, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. The fruit is a small, red drupe that matures in the fall, providing food for various wildlife species."
