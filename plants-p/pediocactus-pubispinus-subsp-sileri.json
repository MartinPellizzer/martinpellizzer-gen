It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white to grayish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
