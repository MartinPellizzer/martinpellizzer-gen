    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis vitellina, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. The flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
