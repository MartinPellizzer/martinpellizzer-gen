    "intro": "Psilocarya robusta var. major, commonly known as the giant magic mushroom, is a variant of the Psilocybe genus native to certain regions of South America. This species is characterized by its large, sturdy caps that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often with a distinctive umbo and a viscid surface. The gills are typically pale to reddish in color and closely spaced, while the stem is thick and often bulbous at the base. It contains high levels of psilocybin and psilocin, making it one of the more potent psychoactive mushroom species. Due to its potency and legal status, it is often cultivated and used in research and therapeutic settings."
