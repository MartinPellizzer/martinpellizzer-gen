    "intro": "Pabstiella truncicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often found on stone surfaces in deserts and mountainous regions. The plant's structure is characterized by a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in ecological studies."
