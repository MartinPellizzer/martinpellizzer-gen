    "intro": "Panicum helvolum, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a distinctive visual element to the landscape. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
