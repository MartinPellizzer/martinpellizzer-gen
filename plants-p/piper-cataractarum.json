    "intro": "Piper cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall pepper or water pepper, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often trail along the ground or climb supports. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, and it produces small, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine. The plant's unique name reflects its natural habitat near waterfalls, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
