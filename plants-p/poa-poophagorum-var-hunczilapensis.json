    "intro": "Poa poophagorum var. hunczilapensis, commonly known as the Hunczilapensis meadow grass, is a rare grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
