    "intro": "Purpureostemon ciliatus, commonly known as the pinkstem tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and showy pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in the summer and attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
