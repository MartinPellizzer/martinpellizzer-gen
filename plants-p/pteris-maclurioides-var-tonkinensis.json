    "intro": "Pteris maclurioides var. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and water features."
