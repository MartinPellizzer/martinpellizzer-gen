    "intro": "Prunus serrulata taihaku, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom or sakura, is a species of flowering shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, creating a striking visual display. The plant has ovate to elliptical leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The fruit it produces is a small, dark purple drupe, which is edible but less commonly consumed than its flowers."
