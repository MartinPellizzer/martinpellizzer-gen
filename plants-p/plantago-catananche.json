    "intro": "Plantago catananche, commonly known as the Spanish plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems topped with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the tiny seeds. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
