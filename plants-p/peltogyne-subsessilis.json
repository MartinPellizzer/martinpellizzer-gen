It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, durable wood and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in racemes, and it produces pods that contain flat, winged seeds. Due to its valuable timber, it is also subject to overharvesting and habitat loss."
