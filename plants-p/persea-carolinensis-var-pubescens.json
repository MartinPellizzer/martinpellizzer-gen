    "intro": "Persea carolinensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the Florida persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside, which gives it the \"pubescens\" variety name. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange to reddish berry that ripens in the fall and is highly prized for its sweet, honey-like flavor. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a valuable addition to native landscapes."
