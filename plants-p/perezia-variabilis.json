    "intro": "Perezia variabilis, commonly known as the variable perezia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting well to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Perezia variabilis is considered a rare and endangered species."
