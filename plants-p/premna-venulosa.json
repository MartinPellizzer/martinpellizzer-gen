It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by three-lobed, persistent fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Premna venulosa is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
