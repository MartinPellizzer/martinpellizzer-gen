    "intro": "Plesioneuron cystodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, ribbon-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The species is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and small, inconspicuous spores."
