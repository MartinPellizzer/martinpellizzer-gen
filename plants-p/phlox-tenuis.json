    "intro": "Phlox tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems covered in opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
