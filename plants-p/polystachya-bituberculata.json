    "intro": "Polystachya bituberculata, commonly known as the two-ridged polystachya, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typical of the Polystachya genus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
