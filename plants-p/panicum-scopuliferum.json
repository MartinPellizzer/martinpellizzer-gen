    "intro": "Panicum scopuliferum, commonly known as seaside bluestem, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces fluffy, pinkish-white seed heads that are adapted to wind dispersal. It is highly tolerant of salt spray and can withstand harsh coastal conditions. Panicum scopuliferum plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing erosion."
