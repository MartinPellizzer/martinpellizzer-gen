    "intro": "Poljakovia falcatolobata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
