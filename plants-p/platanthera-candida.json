    "intro": "Platanthera candida, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, white to pale green flowers. Native to moist, shaded habitats in temperate regions, it thrives in woodland and heathland environments. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its rhizomes for photosynthesis. Its delicate appearance and specific ecological requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
