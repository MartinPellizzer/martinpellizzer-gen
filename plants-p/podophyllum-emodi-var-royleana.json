    "intro": "Podophyllum emodi var. royleana, commonly known as the Himalayan mayapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features a distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaf that is typically 10\u201320 cm in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
