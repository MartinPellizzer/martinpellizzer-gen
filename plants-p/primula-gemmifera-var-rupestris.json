    "intro": "Primula gemmifera var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that are adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires minimal water once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
