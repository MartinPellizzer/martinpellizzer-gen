    "intro": "Phragmites karka, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It has long, slender leaves and produces fluffy, grayish flower spikes that appear in the summer. The plant is highly invasive and can dominate wetland ecosystems, often outcompeting native species. Its rhizomes form dense underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly across water bodies. Phragmites karka plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
