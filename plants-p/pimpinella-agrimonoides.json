    "intro": "Pimpinella agrimonoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf cow-weed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit that splits open when mature. Pimpinella agrimonoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
