    "intro": "Phreatia samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, pale green or white flowers with intricate patterns, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree branches or rocky surfaces. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
