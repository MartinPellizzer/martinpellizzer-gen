    "intro": "Pygmaeopremna herbacea, commonly known as the small-leaved morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped, thin, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
