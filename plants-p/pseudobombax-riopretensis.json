    "intro": "Pseudobombax riopretensis, commonly known as the Rio Pretense ceiba, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland forests."
