It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain pyrethrin, a natural insecticide. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its medicinal and pesticidal properties, it is of interest in both horticulture and organic agriculture."
