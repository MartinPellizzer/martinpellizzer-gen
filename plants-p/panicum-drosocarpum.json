    "intro": "Panicum drosocarpum, commonly known as the clustered panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and its flowering structures are often clustered at the tips of the stems. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
