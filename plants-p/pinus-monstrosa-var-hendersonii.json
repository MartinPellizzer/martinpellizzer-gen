    "intro": "Pinus monstrosa var. hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's twisted pine, is a rare and striking variant of the Monterey pine. It is characterized by its highly contorted, gnarled trunk and branches, which give it a distinctive, almost sculptural appearance. This variety thrives in coastal environments with mild, wet winters and dry summers, typical of its native range in California. Its foliage consists of short, needle-like leaves that are dark green and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its visual appeal."
