    "intro": "Polypodium aurisetum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled margin. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, golden hairs, giving it its common name. Polypodium aurisetum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
