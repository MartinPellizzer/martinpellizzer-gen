    "intro": "Panicum decompositum var. paludosum, commonly known as swamp dropseed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces fluffy, pale yellow to brownish panicles that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it stand out in wetland environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
