    "intro": "Pterocypsela, commonly known as the thornapple or horseweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit known as a pterocypsela, which is adapted for wind dispersal. The plants typically have alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and they produce small, yellow to brown flowers arranged in composite heads. Pterocypsela species are often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. They are native to North America and some parts of Europe."
