    "intro": "Prunus tomentosa var. batalinii, commonly known as the Batalinii cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage that gives it a unique, textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its cold hardiness, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits."
