    "intro": "Planchonella ericiflora, commonly known as the hairy hibiscus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
