    "intro": "Papualthia boholensis, commonly known as the Bohol orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the lowland forests of Bohol. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
