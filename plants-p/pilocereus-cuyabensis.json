It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring a rounded, segmented stem and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in the summer. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
