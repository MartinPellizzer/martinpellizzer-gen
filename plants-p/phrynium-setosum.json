    "intro": "Phrynium setosum, commonly known as the hairy phrynium, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are typically borne on tall, leafless stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shaded environments. Phrynium setosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
