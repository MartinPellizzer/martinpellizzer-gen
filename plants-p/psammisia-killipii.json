    "intro": "Psammisia killipii, commonly known as the Killip's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Psammisia killipii is an important component of coastal dune ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
