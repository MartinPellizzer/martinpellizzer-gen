    "intro": "Pilosella obscura, commonly known as the dark hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, wiry stems that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Pilosella obscura thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows."
