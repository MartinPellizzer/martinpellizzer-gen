    "intro": "Protorhus buxifolia, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red berries. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
