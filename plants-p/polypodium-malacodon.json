    "intro": "Polypodium malacodon, commonly known as the Malacodon holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are often dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or along stream banks. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
