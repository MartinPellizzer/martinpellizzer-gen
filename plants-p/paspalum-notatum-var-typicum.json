    "intro": "Paspalum notatum var. typicum, commonly known as buffalograss, is a native perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense sod-forming habit and drought-tolerant nature, making it well-suited for dry climates. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in full sun and is often used in turfgrass applications due to its hardiness and minimal maintenance requirements. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to spread and form a cohesive lawn or ground cover."
