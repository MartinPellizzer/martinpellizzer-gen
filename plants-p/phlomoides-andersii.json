    "intro": "Phlomoides andersii, commonly known as the mountain phlomis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open grasslands or shrublands. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of blue to purple flowers, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Phlomoides andersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
