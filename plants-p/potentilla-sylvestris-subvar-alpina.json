    "intro": "Potentilla sylvestris subvar. alpina, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically features compound leaves with five leaflets, which are oval to lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
