    "intro": "Pabstiella sarcopetala, commonly known as the stone petal orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, fleshy leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its reproductive strategy involves a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella sarcopetala is considered an endangered species."
