    "intro": "Phlegmariurus bolanicus, commonly known as the Bolan clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores for propagation. Phlegmariurus bolanicus plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
