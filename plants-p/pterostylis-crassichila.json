    "intro": "Pterostylis crassichila, commonly known as the broad-leaved helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a single, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, erect flower spike with a distinctive helmet-shaped labellum. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
