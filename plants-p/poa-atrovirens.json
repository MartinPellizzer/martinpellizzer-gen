It is characterized by its dark green, often bluish-gray foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
