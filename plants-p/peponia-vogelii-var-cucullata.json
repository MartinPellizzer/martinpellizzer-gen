It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like bracts that enclose the small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when they turn from green to yellow or orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The botanical features of this species make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
