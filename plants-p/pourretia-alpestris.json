    "intro": "Pourretia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine pourretia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
