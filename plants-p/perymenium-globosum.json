    "intro": "Perymenium globosum, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, thalloid structure that forms a dense, cushion-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemma cups, which aid in vegetative propagation. The plant's morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of understory ecosystems in temperate regions."
