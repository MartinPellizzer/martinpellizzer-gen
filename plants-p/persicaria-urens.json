    "intro": "Persicaria urens, commonly known as bladder campion, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that burst to release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. Persicaria urens is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions."
