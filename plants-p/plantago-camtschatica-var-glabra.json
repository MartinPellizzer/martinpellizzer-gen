    "intro": "Plantago camtschatica var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. This variety is distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the leaves, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other plantain species."
