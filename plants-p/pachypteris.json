    "intro": "Pachypteris, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their thick, leathery fronds and are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the genus its name. Pachypteris species often thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky habitats. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them important components of their native ecosystems."
