    "intro": "Paraleptochilus, commonly known as the slender leathery fern, is a rare and distinctive member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and its unique, leathery, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are closely clustered on the stems. Paraleptochilus is notable for its primitive features, making it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution."
