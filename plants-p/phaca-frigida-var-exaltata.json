    "intro": "Phaca frigida var. exaltata, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pale blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
