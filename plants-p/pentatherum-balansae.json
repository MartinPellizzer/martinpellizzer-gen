    "intro": "Pentatherum balansae, commonly known as the Balansae fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
