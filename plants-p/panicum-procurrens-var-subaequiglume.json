    "intro": "Panicum procurrens var. subaequiglume, commonly known as the narrow-lemma panicgrass, is a variant of the panic grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-ranked spikelets. Its botanical features include short, stiff bracts and lemma and palea that are nearly equal in length, giving it the subspecies name \"subaequiglume.\" This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
