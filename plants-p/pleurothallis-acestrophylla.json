    "intro": "Pleurothallis acestrophylla, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display a striking golden-yellow color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. The flowers bloom in the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to the forest canopy."
