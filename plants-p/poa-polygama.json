    "intro": "Poa polygama, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Poa polygama is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixes for its fine texture and durability."
