    "intro": "Polygonum depressum, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Polygonum depressum is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
