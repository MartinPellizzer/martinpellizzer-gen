    "intro": "Protium schlechteri, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
