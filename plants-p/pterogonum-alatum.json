It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, wing-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely grown outside its native habitat."
