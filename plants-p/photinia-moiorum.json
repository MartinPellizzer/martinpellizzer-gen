    "intro": "Photinia moiorum, commonly known as the red leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking, glossy red foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the autumn. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins and a leathery texture. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
