    "intro": "Poa compressa f. langiana, commonly known as the Langian meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass that typically thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in meadows, lawns, and along the edges of water bodies. Botanically, it is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to form dense turf-like vegetation."
