    "intro": "Phlegmariurus capellae, commonly known as the Capella's haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to reddish-brown stems. The leaves are elongated, often with a distinct midrib, and the capsules are typically curved and covered in a thin, transparent peristome. This moss is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
