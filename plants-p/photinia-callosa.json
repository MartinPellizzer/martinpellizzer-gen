    "intro": "Photinia callosa, commonly known as the glossy leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage that turns vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping."
