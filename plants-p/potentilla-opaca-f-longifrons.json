    "intro": "Potentilla opaca f. longifrons, commonly known as the long-fruited potentilla, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that matures in the fall, releasing tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
