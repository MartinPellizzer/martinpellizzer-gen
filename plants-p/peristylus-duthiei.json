    "intro": "Peristylus duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's peristylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peristylus duthiei is considered a species of conservation concern."
