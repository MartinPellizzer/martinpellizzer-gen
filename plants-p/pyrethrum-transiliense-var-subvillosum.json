    "intro": "Pyrethrum transiliense var. subvillosum, commonly known as the silky pyrethrum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its finely hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces pyrethrins, natural insecticides used in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long-lasting blooms."
