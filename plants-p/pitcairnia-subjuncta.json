    "intro": "Pitcairnia subjuncta, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain water in humid environments. Pitcairnia subjuncta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid gardens."
