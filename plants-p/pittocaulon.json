    "intro": "Pittocaulon, commonly known as the desert pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, spherical inflorescence that resembles a pincushion. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Pittocaulon is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
