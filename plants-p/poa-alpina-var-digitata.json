    "intro": "Poa alpina var. digitata, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a variant of the alpine grass species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. This plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences that produce lightweight seeds adapted for wind dispersal. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, mountainous habitat."
