    "intro": "Passerina nivicola, commonly known as the snow bunting, is a small, hardy bird that thrives in cold climates. While not a plant, it is often mistaken for one due to its name and habitat. The confusion arises from its association with alpine and arctic environments where certain plants also grow. Its presence indicates a specific ecological niche. It plays a role in seed dispersal and serves as prey for various predators in its ecosystem."
