    "intro": "Polypodium ellipticosorum, commonly known as the elliptic huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, and is native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
