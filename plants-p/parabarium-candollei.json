It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often adorned with small, golden spore cases. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Parabarium candollei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
