    "intro": "Pyrrosia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, white mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Pyrrosia philippinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
