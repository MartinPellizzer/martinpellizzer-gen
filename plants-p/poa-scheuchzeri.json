    "intro": "Poa scheuchzeri, commonly known as the Scheuchzer's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Poa scheuchzeri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
