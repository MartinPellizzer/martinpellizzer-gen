    "intro": "Paphiopedilum warszewiczianum, commonly known as the Warszewicz's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, velvety pouch-shaped lip, which is a defining feature of the lady's slipper orchid genus. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a yellow or orange throat. It prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
