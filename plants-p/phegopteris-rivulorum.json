    "intro": "Phegopteris rivulorum, commonly known as the running marsh fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wetlands, and rocky crevices, often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are released during the summer months. Its rhizome is creeping and often covered with a layer of brown, hairy tissue. The fronds are usually bright green and have a feathery appearance, making it easily recognizable in its natural habitat."
