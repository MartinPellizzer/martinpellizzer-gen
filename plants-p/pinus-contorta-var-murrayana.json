It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. The tree is characterized by its slender, often contorted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically two to three inches long. Its cones are woody and contain two to four seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and poor soils."
