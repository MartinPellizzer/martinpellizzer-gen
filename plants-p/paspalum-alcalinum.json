    "intro": "Paspalum alcalinum, commonly known as alkali grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it highly adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry fields. Its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
