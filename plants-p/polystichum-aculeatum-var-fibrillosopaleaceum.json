    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. fibrillosopaleaceum, commonly known as the fibrous paleaceum fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silky, fibrous layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a pale, almost silvery hue on the underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
