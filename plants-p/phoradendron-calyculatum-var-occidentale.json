    "intro": "Phoradendron calyculatum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a distinctive appearance with small, elliptical leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to the ecological dynamics of its environment through seed dispersal."
