    "intro": "Parodia neglecta, commonly known as the \"Neglected Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
