    "intro": "Parodia calvescens, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, longitudinal ribs that give it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and indoor gardening."
