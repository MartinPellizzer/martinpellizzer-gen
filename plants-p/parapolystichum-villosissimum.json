    "intro": "Parapolystichum villosissimum, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds covered in dense, velvety hairs, which provide a unique texture and aid in water retention. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices where moisture is retained. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
