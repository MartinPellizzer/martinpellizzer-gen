    "intro": "Pyrus parviflora var. amygdaliformis, commonly known as the dwarf pear or Japanese dwarf pear, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The fruit is a small, yellowish pear-like berry that ripens in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its floral display and hardy nature."
