    "intro": "Pityrogramma lehmannii, commonly known as the lehmann's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are typically divided into small, feather-like segments, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Pityrogramma lehmannii plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
