    "intro": "Praravinia urophylloides, commonly known as the red-stemmed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, upright stems that are reddish in color, which distinguish it from similar species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a slight sheen. Praravinia urophylloides plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
