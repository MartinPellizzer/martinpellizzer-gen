    "intro": "Phoradendron longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropics. It possesses specialized roots called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health and growth of its host tree."
