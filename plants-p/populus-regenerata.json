    "intro": "Populus regenerata, commonly known as the regenerating poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. Populus regenerata is known for its rapid growth and ability to regenerate from cuttings, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
