    "intro": "Pseudoyoungia ladyginii, commonly known as the Ladygin's pseudoyoungia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
