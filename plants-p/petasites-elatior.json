    "intro": "Petasites elatior, commonly known as the giant cow parsnip, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest edges and meadows."
