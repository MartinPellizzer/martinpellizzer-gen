    "intro": "Pinus yunnanensis subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as the Yunnan dwarf pine, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its shorter stature and more delicate foliage compared to the typical Pinus yunnanensis. The leaves are needle-like, typically growing in bundles of five, and are often a darker green than those of its relatives. The cones are small and usually hang downward, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist climates."
