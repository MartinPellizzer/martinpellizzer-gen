    "intro": "Perama harleyi, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Perama harleyi plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species."
