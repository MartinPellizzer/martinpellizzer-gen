    "intro": "Phacelia hydrophylloides, commonly known as water phacelia, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in streambanks and moist meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
