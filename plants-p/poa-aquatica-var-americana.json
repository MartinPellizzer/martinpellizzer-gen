    "intro": "Poa aquatica var. americana, commonly known as American watergrass, is a variant of the watergrass species native to North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
