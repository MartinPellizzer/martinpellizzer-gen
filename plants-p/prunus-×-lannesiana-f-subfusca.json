    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. subfusca, commonly known as the dark-leafed cherry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus \u00d7 yedoensis. It is characterized by its dark green, almost black foliage, which gives it a striking appearance. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart cherries. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
