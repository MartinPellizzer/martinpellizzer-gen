    "intro": "Pleurothallis cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Pleurothallis cipoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
