    "intro": "Paullinia carpopodea subf. gymnorhachis, commonly known as the Brazilian balsa or the gymnorhachis balsa, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapindaceae family. It is characterized by its light, porous wood, which is among the lightest known in the plant kingdom. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits. This species is native to the Amazon Basin and is valued for its unique wood properties and ecological role in tropical forests."
