    "intro": "Prunus avium f. salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf peach, is a unique cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves. This variety is notable for its elongated, narrow foliage that gives it a distinct appearance compared to typical peach trees. The flowers are similar to those of standard peaches, featuring pink to white petals, and the fruit is generally smaller and more tart than common peaches. It is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and is also used in horticultural breeding programs. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth and fruit production."
