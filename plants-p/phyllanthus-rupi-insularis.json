    "intro": "Phyllanthus rupi-insularis, commonly known as the rock island mallow, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and island habitats. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in dense, yellowish-green inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
