    "intro": "Polystichum otomasui, commonly known as the Otoma fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum otomasui thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
