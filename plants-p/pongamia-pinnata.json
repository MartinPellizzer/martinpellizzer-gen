    "intro": "Pongamia pinnata, commonly known as the Indian beech or karanj, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a distinctive yellowish or reddish color. The tree produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing oily seeds that are used in various traditional and industrial applications. Pongamia pinnata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems. Its resilience to poor soil conditions and ability to thrive in coastal areas make it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
