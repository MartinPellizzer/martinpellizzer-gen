    "intro": "Phellandrium ciliatum, commonly known as the coastal lemon-scented gum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a lemon-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its adaptability to sandy soils and salt spray makes it a hardy species suited to coastal environments. Phellandrium ciliatum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
