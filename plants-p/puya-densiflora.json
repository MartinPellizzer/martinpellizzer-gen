    "intro": "Puya densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, and often spiny leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces tall flower stalks bearing clusters of showy, red or orange bracts that are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators. Puya densiflora is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions with ample sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
