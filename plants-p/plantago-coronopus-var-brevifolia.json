    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical *Plantago coronopus*. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
