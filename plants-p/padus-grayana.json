    "intro": "Padus grayana, commonly known as Gray's maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically 5-9 cm in diameter and have a distinctive reddish or bronze hue during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
