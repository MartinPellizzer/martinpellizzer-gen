    "intro": "Pneumatopteris obliqua, commonly known as the oblique water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for efficient gas exchange in water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Pneumatopteris obliqua plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration."
