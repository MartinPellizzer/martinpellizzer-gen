    "intro": "Pitcairnia lignosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the base of the rosette. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native habitat."
