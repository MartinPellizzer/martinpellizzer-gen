    "intro": "Padus napaulensis var. distincta, commonly known as the distinct-flowered maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically bright green and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that aids in wind dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes and unique foliage."
