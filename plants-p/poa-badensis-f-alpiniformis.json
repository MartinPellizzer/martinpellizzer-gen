    "intro": "Poa badensis f. alpiniformis, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude habitats."
