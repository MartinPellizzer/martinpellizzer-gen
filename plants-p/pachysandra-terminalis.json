    "intro": "Pachysandra terminalis, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance, and its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is highly resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Pachysandra terminalis is also known for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil types and its slow growth rate, which makes it ideal for erosion control."
