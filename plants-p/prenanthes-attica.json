    "intro": "Prenanthes attica, commonly known as the eastern waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose umbels and bloom from July to September. Prenanthes attica plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
