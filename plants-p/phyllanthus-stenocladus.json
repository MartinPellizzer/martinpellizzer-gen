    "intro": "Phyllanthus stenocladus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phyllanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features opposite, narrow, leathery leaves that are often glandular-dotted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
