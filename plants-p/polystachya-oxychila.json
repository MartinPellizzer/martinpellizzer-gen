    "intro": "Polystachya oxychila, commonly known as the sharp-leafed bromeliad, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features rosettes of narrow, acuminate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched flower spike that bears small, white to pale pink flowers. Polystachya oxychila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
