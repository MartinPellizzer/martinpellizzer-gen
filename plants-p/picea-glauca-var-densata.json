    "intro": "Picea glauca var. densata, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, is a variant of the white spruce species native to western North America. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is commonly used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
