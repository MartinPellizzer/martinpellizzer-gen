    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subvar. grandis, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and rocky areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for garden use. The subspecies grandis is distinguished by its larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other varieties of Potentilla anserina."
