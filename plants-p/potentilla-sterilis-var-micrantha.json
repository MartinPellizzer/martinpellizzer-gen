    "intro": "Potentilla sterilis var. micrantha, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, rounded leaves with five to seven lobes. The species is noted for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
