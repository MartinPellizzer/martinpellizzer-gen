    "intro": "Philodendron adamantinum, commonly known as the Emerald Queen, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant has a climbing habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant but should be handled with care as it is toxic to humans and pets."
