    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features multiple stems with dense, rounded foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often covered in fine, silky hairs, though the variety 'glabrata' is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks."
