    "intro": "Polypodium subhastatum var. longifrons, commonly known as the long-fronded cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that can reach several feet in length. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided with serrated margins and possess a leathery texture. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the wet season."
