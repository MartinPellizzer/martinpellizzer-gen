    "intro": "Protium cubense, commonly known as Cuban sand-leaf, is a member of the Burseraceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of the Greater Antilles. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually leathery and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Protium cubense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
