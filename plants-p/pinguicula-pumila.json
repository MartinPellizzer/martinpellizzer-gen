    "intro": "Pinguicula pumila, commonly known as the miniature butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tiny, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap tiny insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or mossy areas. Its flowers are small and usually pink or reddish, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its size and habitat, it is often considered a rare and specialized species within the genus Pinguicula."
