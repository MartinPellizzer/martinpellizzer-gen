    "intro": "Pavetta bidentata var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species with showy flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with simple, opposite leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
