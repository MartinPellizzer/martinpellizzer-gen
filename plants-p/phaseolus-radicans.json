    "intro": "Phaseolus radicans, commonly known as the everbearing bean or climbing bean, is a tropical vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to pods containing edible, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and high yield, it is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
