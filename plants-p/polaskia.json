    "intro": "Polaskia, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, nocturnal flowers that open at night. Polaskia species typically have a short, thick trunk and are often branched, with a rounded or cylindrical shape. Their leaves are usually modified into spines, and the flowers are large, fragrant, and typically white or pale yellow. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique blooming habits."
