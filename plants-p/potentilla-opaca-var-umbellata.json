    "intro": "Potentilla opaca var. umbellata, commonly known as the umbellate cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces fruiting structures called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
