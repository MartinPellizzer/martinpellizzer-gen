    "intro": "Pedicularis labradorica var. sulphurea, commonly known as the Yellow Monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its unique coloration and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
