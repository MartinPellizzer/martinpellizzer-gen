    "intro": "Pelma melanoxanthum, commonly known as the black-yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and yellowish on the underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain toxic seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health and growth of its host trees."
