    "intro": "Plantago major f. dura, commonly known as the hardy plantain, is a robust variant of the common plantain. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly tolerant of urban environments. This form is particularly valued for its medicinal properties and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
