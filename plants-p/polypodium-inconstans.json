    "intro": "Polypodium inconstans, commonly known as the variable polypody, is a fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium inconstans is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both wild and cultivated settings."
