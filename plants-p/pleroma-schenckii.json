    "intro": "Pleroma schenckii, commonly known as the Schenck's pleroma, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Pleroma schenckii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
