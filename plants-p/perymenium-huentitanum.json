It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
