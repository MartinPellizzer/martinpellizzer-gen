    "intro": "Phalaenopsis pulcherrima f. alba, commonly known as the white phalaenopsis orchid, is a cultivar of the Phalaenopsis genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, broad, and white petals and sepals, which give it a strikingly pure appearance. This orchid is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining potting media. The plant is prized for its long-lasting blooms and is a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
