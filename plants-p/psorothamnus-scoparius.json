    "intro": "Psorothamnus scoparius, commonly known as the desert ratany, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, needle-like leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
