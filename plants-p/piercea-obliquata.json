    "intro": "Piercea obliquata, commonly known as the slender pincushion cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
