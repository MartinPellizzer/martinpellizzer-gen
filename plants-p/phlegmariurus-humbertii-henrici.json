    "intro": "Phlegmariurus humbertii-henrici, commonly known as the Humbert's clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures. It is a cryptogamic plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds, typical of its evolutionary lineage. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its morphology includes a creeping stem with whorled leaves, and it exhibits a unique branching pattern that distinguishes it from other clubmosses. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
