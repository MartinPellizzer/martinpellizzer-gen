It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. This plant is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are usually evergreen, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. It is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions around the world."
