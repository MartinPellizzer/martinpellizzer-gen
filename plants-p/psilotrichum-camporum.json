    "intro": "Psilotrichum camporum, commonly known as the camp orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, greenish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique botanical features include the absence of true leaves and the presence of specialized root structures for nutrient absorption. Psilotrichum camporum is often found in grassland habitats and is relatively rare, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
