    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its medicinal properties, similar to other plantain species, have been historically used for their soothing effects on skin irritations."
