    "intro": "Pinalia robusta, commonly known as the robust pinalia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Pinalia robusta is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in arid and coastal environments."
