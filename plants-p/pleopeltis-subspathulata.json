    "intro": "Pleopeltis subspathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The leaves are typically divided into segments, with the lower leaves being more elongated than the upper ones."
