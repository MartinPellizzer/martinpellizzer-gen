    "intro": "Phlox subulata var. ciliata, commonly known as the Sierra snowbank phlox, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of tiny, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has needle-like, silver-blue foliage that is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and minimal water requirements. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and resilient addition to native plant landscapes."
