    "intro": "Prunus brigantina var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf cherry plum, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkans. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, sweet-tart berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability. The variety 'microcarpa' is distinguished by its smaller fruits compared to other Prunus species."
