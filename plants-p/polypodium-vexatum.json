    "intro": "Polypodium vexatum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium vexatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture."
