    "intro": "Pilosocereus oligolepis, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring a swollen, rounded stem known as a \"pseudostem\" and a colorful, often vibrant top that is actually a different species grafted onto the main plant. The plant has spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements. Its botanical structure includes thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions."
