    "intro": "Polypodium parallelinerve, commonly known as the parallel-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into smaller, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a distinct parallel venation pattern that gives it its scientific name. The rhizomes of Polypodium parallelinerve are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
