    "intro": "Polypodium azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Azores. It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a thick, creeping rhizome with dense, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
