    "intro": "Primula amethystina subsp. amethystina, commonly known as the purple primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of tubular flowers, which are typically violet to purple in color. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant flowering plants."
