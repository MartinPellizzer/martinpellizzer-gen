It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Pottsia pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
