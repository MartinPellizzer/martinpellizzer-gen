    "intro": "Persea canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a large, pear-shaped berry with a smooth, dark green skin and a creamy, buttery flesh. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and its edible fruit, which is similar to the common avocado but has a distinct flavor."
