    "intro": "Pterolepis glomerata var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved clustered pterolepis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that give it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native habitat."
