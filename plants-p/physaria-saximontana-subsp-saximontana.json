    "intro": "Physaria saximontana subsp. saximontana, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes."
