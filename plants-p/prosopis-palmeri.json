    "intro": "Prosopis palmeri, commonly known as the palmer's mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and compound leaves that are typically reduced to spines in mature plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Prosopis palmeri plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species."
