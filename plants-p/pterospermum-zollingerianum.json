It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, which are often covered in a tuft of hair for wind dispersal."
