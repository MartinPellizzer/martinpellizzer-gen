It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shores, where it thrives in humid and saline conditions. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and delicate, usually white or pale pink, and are arranged in a raceme. Petalochilus littoricola is well adapted to its coastal environment, with specialized structures that help it retain moisture and withstand salt spray."
