    "intro": "Passerina rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking red or pink petals and is part of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Passerina rubra has a short stem with basal leaves that are palmately lobed. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, making it an early indicator of seasonal change."
