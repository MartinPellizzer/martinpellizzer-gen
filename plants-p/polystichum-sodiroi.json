    "intro": "Polystichum sodiroi, commonly known as the Sodiro's holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Polystichum sodiroi is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
