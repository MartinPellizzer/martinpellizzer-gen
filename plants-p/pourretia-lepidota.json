    "intro": "Pourretia lepidota, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
