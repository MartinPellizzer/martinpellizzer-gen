    "intro": "Paullinia thalictrifolia var. argentea, commonly known as silverleaf st. john's wort, is a rare variant of the species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a leathery texture and prominent veins. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique foliage and limited distribution."
