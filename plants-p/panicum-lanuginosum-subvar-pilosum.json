    "intro": "Panicum lanuginosum subvar. pilosum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation."
