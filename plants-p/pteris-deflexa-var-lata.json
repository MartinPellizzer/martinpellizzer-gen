    "intro": "Pteris deflexa var. lata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, spreading growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the pinnae. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to humid, indoor conditions."
