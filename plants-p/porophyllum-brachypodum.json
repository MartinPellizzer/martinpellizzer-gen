It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and the leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss.
