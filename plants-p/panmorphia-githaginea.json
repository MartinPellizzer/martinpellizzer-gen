    "intro": "Panmorphia githaginea, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its elongated, waxy leaves that exhibit a unique iridescent sheen under moonlight, giving it its common name. The flowers, which bloom only during the night, are pale lavender with intricate, almost otherworldly patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
