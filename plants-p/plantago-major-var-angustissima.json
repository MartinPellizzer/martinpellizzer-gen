    "intro": "Plantago major var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and other sunny, open areas. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical Plantago major."
