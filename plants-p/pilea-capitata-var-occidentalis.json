    "intro": "Pilea capitata var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial with distinctive round, shield-shaped leaves. It belongs to the Araceae family and is native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
