It features fleshy, thick leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is well-adapted to hot, dry environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. It produces small, rounded fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Portulaca dubia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, resilient species."
