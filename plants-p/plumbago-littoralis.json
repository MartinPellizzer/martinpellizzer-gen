It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Plumbago littoralis is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy coastal species."
