    "intro": "Polygala tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family, characterized by its small, often showy flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to arid conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
