    "intro": "Poa bolanderi subsp. chandleri, commonly known as Chandler's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This subspecies typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal prairies and valley floors. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
