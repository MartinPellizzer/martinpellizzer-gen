    "intro": "Pteris manickamii, commonly known as the Kanyakumari water fern, is a species of fern native to the southern regions of India. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a waxy coating. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving it a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other fern species."
