    "intro": "Prunus semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming cherry or compact cherry, is a species of flowering shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its ability to produce flowers throughout the growing season, often from early spring to late summer. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom on short pedicels, and its leaves are oval with a slightly serrated edge. It is typically used in ornamental landscaping due to its compact size and persistent flowering. Prunus semperflorens thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers."
