It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic, often hollow stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Pimpinella apiifolia is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows."
