    "intro": "Psedera, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. They have a toxic sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making them potentially dangerous to humans and animals. Psedera species are often cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value, though care must be taken due to their toxicity."
