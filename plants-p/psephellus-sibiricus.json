    "intro": "Psephellus sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate stems and small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, dry habitat. Psephellus sibiricus is often found in tundra and steppe regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
