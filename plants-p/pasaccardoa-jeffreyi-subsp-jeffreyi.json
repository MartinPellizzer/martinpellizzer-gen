    "intro": "Pasaccardoa jeffreyi subsp. jeffreyi, commonly known as the Jeffrey's pasaccardoa, is a rare and specialized member of the Gasteromycetes order. It is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like fruiting body that develops from a basal stipe. The species is typically found in specific, often humid and shaded environments, such as forest floors in temperate regions. Its spores are released in a unique manner, facilitated by the elongation of the volva, which helps disperse the spores effectively. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately balanced and ecologically significant species."
