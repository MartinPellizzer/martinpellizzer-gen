    "intro": "Psychotria glandulifera, commonly known as the \"Coca plant\" or \"Yareli,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its elliptical leaves with prominent veins and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It contains alkaloids, including cocaine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and rituals. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and economically important due to its psychoactive properties."
