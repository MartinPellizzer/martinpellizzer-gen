    "intro": "Peyrousia silenoides, commonly known as the silversword, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-blue, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, yellowish flowers, which bloom in late summer. Peyrousia silenoides is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found on volcanic slopes. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
