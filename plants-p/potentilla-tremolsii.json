    "intro": "Potentilla tremolsii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. Potentilla tremolsii is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in garden settings that mimic its natural environment."
