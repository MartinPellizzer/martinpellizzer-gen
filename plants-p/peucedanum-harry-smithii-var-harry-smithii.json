    "intro": "Peucedanum harry-smithii var. harry-smithii, commonly known as Harry-Smith's angelica, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and they contain compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
