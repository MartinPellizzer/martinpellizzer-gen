    "intro": "Polypodium itatimense, commonly known as the Itat\u00ed fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Polypodium itatimense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
