    "intro": "Phalaris aquatica var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear spike-like clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes, pond margins, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common species in freshwater ecosystems."
