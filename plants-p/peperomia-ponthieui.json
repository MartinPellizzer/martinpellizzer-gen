It features glossy, dark green leaves with a striking silvery or white underside, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture. Peperomia ponthieui is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental foliage."
