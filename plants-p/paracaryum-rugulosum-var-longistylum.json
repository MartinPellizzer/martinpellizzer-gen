    "intro": "Paracaryum rugulosum var. longistylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to parts of Africa and thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil. The species is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its botanical features make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in certain regions."
