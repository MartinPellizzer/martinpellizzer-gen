    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subvar. subincanescens, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silvery-white, hairy leaves that reflect sunlight, aiding in thermoregulation in cold environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. It is well adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats."
