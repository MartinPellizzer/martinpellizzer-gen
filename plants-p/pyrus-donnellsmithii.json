    "intro": "Pyrus donnellsmithii, commonly known as the Donnell Smith pear, is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet, and aromatic pears in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
