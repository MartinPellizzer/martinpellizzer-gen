    "intro": "Poa bulbillifera, commonly known as the bulbous bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, with each spikelet containing a single floret that develops into a bulbil, a vegetative reproduction structure. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. Poa bulbillifera is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
