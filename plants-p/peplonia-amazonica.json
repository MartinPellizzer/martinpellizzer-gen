    "intro": "Peplonia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian peplonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to three meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Peplonia amazonica is considered an endangered species."
