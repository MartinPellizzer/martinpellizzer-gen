    "intro": "Ptychosperma rumphii, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing species that can live for centuries, making it a significant component of its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable to extinction."
