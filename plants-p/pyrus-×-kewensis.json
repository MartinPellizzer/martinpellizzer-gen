    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 kewensis, commonly known as the Kew pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyrifolia (Asian pear). It is characterized by its large, sweet, and juicy fruits that are often used in both fresh consumption and culinary applications. The plant typically grows as a medium-sized tree with broad, lobed leaves and a moderate growth rate. It is cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The Kew pear is a testament to the successful hybridization efforts in botanical horticulture."
