    "intro": "Poa ochotensis, commonly known as the Ochotenskaya bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue flowers, which are typical of the Poa genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in cooler climates as a ground cover or for erosion control."
