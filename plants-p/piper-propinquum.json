    "intro": "Piper propinquum, commonly known as the close relative of the pepper plant, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a reddish color, containing the alkaloid piperine, which is responsible for its spicy flavor. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires support for its climbing growth habit. Due to its botanical similarity to other pepper species, it is often studied for its potential medicinal and culinary uses."
