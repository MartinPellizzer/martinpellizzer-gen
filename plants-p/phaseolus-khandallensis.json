    "intro": "Phaseolus khandallensis, commonly known as the Khandallan bean, is a lesser-known species of the legume genus Phaseolus. It is native to the mountainous regions of northern India and is characterized by its small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate structures. It is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. The botanical features of P. khandallensis make it an interesting subject for research in plant taxonomy and agricultural botany."
