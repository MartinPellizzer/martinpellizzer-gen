    "intro": "Pfundia arvensis, commonly known as the field sandwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in dry, sandy soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Pfundia arvensis is often considered a weed in agricultural fields due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
