    "intro": "Primula virginis subsp. petrophyes, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or talus slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It blooms in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has emerged. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
