It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with four distinct veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
