    "intro": "Plagiobothrys rufescens var. renjifoanus, commonly known as the Renjifo's bluebells, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
