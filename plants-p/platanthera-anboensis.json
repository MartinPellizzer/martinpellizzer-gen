    "intro": "Platanthera anboensis, commonly known as the Anbo marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct white lip. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats, often in association with sphagnum moss. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
