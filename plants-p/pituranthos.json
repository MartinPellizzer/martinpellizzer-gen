    "intro": "Pituranthos, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact, evergreen shrubs with dense foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Pituranthos species are adapted to harsh, dry environments, featuring succulent leaves and deep root systems for water storage and absorption. They play an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing nectar for bees and other pollinators. The genus is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
