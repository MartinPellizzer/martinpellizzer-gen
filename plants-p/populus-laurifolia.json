    "intro": "Populus laurifolia, commonly known as the laurel poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in the spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a small, winged samara that aids in seed dispersal. Populus laurifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in floodplains."
