    "intro": "Polypodium bandoi, commonly known as the Bando huperzia, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium bandoi is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
