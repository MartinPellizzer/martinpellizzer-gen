    "intro": "Pilocereus cometes, commonly known as the comet cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Pilocereus cometes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in xeriscaping."
