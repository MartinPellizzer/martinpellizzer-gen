    "intro": "Phanera steenisii, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like growth habit and its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, elongated leaves that are often hidden among the dense foliage of its habitat. Phanera steenisii is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
