    "intro": "Paphia costata, commonly known as the serrated paphiopedilum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spurred lip that resembles a bird's beak, a feature typical of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a contrasting lip. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Paphia costata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in horticulture."
