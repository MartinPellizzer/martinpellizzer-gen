    "intro": "Purgosea ciliata, commonly known as the silky mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive leaf margins, which are finely toothed or ciliate. Purgosea ciliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
