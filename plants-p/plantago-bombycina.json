    "intro": "Plantago bombycina, commonly known as the cotton plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of broad, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects on the respiratory and digestive systems."
