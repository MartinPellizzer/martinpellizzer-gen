    "intro": "Pseudocalymma alliaceum var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in wet or seasonally waterlogged soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
