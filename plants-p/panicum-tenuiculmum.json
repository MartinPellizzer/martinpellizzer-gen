It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce lightweight seeds. Its botanical characteristics include narrow leaves and a rhizomatous root system, which help it thrive in moist conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
