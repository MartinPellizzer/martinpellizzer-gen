    "intro": "Podadenia sapida, commonly known as the sour gum or sour tea plant, is a small shrub native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves that emit a distinctive citrus-like scent. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several elliptical seeds. Podadenia sapida is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for its purported digestive and tonic properties."
