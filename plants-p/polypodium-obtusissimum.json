    "intro": "Polypodium obtusissimum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to tree trunks or rocks. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile leaves appearing in the second year, producing sporangia on the underside."
