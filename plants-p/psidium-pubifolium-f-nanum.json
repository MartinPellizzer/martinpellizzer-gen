    "intro": "Psidium pubifolium f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple guava, is a compact variant of the pineapple guava plant. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in taste to regular pineapple guavas but are typically smaller in size. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, sunny climate for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is often cultivated in gardens and small-scale orchards."
