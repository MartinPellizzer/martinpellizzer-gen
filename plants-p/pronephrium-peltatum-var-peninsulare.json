    "intro": "Pronephrium peltatum var. peninsulare, commonly known as the Peninsular Pronephrium, is a rare plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its botanical structure includes a short stem and fibrous roots adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
