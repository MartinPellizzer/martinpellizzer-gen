    "intro": "Pachyphyllum micrangis, commonly known as the narrow-angled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
