    "intro": "Payena mentzelii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and high value for timber, it is considered vulnerable to overexploitation."
