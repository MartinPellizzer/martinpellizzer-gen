    "intro": "Philadelphus grandiflorus, commonly known as the common mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with ovate to elliptic leaflets and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its showy, clustered blooms that resemble those of true oranges, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Philadelphus grandiflorus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
