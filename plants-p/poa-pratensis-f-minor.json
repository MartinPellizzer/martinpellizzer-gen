    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. minor, commonly known as the lesser meadow grass, is a botanical variant of the tall fescue species. It is characterized by its shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to the typical Poa pratensis. This grass is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals."
