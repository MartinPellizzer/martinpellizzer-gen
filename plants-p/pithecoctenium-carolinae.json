    "intro": "Pithecoctenium carolinae, commonly known as the Carolina grassveld, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
