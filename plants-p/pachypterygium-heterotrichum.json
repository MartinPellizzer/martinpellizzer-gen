    "intro": "Pachypterygium heterotrichum, commonly known as the hairy-winged fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are often covered in short, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
