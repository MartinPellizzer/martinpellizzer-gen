    "intro": "Prasophyllum cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded leek orchid, is an Australian endemic plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of white or pale green flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive hood-like structure formed by the sepals and petals, which enclose the labellum. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Prasophyllum cucullatum is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and is often found in regions of New South Wales and Victoria."
