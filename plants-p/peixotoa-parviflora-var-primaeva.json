    "intro": "Peixotoa parviflora var. primaeva, commonly known as the early flowering peixotoa, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, making it a unique addition to botanical gardens. Its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
