It is characterized by its striking bicolor foliage, with upper surfaces of the needles appearing white or silvery and lower surfaces green. This plant is native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its distinctive appearance makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. The species is also valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems at elevations above 3,000 meters."
