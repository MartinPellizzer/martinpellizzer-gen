    "intro": "Pteris digitata, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and India, and thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. Pteris digitata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
