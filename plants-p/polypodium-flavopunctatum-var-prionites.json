    "intro": "Polypodium flavopunctatum var. prionites, commonly known as the golden dot holly fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with golden-yellow spots along the veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives on rocky or moist soil. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of the Polypodiaceae family. The golden dot holly fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
