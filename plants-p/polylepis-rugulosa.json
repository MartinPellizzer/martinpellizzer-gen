    "intro": "Polylepis rugulosa, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest tree, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its rugged, fissured bark and conical shape, which helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. This plant is a member of the Rosaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive rugose texture, contributing to its unique appearance. Polylepis rugulosa plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of cloud forests in South America."
