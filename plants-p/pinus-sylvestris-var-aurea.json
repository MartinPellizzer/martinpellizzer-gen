    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. aurea, commonly known as the golden Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine characterized by its striking golden foliage. It is native to parts of Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant color. The leaves, or needles, are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical Scots pine, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for adding visual interest to parks and public spaces."
