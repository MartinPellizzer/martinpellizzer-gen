    "intro": "Parathelypteris glanduligera var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in high humidity. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, glandular dots on the undersides that contribute to its unique appearance. This variety is notable for its soft, hairy texture, which distinguishes it from other members of the genus."
