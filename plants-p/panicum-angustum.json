    "intro": "Panicum angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
