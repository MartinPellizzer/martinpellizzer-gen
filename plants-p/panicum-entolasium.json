    "intro": "Panicum entolasium, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and drought tolerance."
