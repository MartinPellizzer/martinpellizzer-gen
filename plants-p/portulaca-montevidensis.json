    "intro": "Portulaca montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense portulaca, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in hot, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its thick, waxy leaves. It is often found in sandy soils and is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty."
