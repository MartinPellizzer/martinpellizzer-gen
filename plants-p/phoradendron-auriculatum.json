    "intro": "Phoradendron auriculatum, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to the roots of other trees to obtain some of its nutrients. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a heart-shaped base. The golden shower tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
