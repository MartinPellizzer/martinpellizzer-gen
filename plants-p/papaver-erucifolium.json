    "intro": "Papaver erucifolium, commonly known as the woolly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and striking, bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
