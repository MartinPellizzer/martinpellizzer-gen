    "intro": "Pandanus angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan pandanus, is a tropical plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its roots are fibrous and can be used for making ropes and mats. The Angolan pandanus thrives in wet, coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments."
