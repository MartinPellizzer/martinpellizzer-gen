    "intro": "Puya tunarensis, commonly known as the Tunari puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean region of Bolivia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure typical of bromeliads. Puya tunarensis is known for its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
