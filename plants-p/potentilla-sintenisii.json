    "intro": "Potentilla sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenisi cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, holly-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
