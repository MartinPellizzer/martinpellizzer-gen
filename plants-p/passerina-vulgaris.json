    "intro": "Passerina vulgaris, commonly known as the common flax, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of linseed oil. Passerina vulgaris thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
