    "intro": "Polypodium lepidopteris, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
