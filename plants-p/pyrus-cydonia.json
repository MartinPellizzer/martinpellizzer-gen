    "intro": "Pyrus cydonia, commonly known as the Chinese quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces large, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn. The plant has a rough, bark-like skin and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is often used in cooking, baking, and traditional medicine due to its high pectin content and unique flavor."
