    "intro": "Phegopteris pilosa, commonly known as the hairy cliffbrake, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds covered in fine, soft hairs. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant's fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a lanceolate shape and a serrated margin. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
