    "intro": "Poa kelloggii, commonly known as Kellogg\u2019s bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, mat-like turf. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soils effectively. Poa kelloggii is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
