    "intro": "Philodendron variifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves, which often display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to anchor itself to trees and climb toward light. Its heart-shaped leaves are typically large, sometimes reaching up to 12 inches in length. Philodendron variifolium thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish."
