    "intro": "Polypodium rivulare, commonly known as the stream fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the formation of dense colonies. Polypodium rivulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
