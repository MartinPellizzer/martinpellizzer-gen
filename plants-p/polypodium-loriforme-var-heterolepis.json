    "intro": "Polypodium loriforme var. heterolepis, commonly known as the variable hound's-tongue fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The varietal form heterolepis is distinguished by variations in leaf shape and size compared to the typical form of Polypodium loriforme."
