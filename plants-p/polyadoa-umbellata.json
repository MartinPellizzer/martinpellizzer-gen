    "intro": "Polyadoa umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its feathery, arching fronds that resemble an umbrella. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant features a short, unbranched stem with roots that form a dense, fibrous mat near the soil surface. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with each segment bearing small, rounded lobes that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Polyadoa umbellata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
