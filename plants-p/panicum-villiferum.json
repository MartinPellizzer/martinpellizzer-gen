    "intro": "Panicum villiferum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Panicum villiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
