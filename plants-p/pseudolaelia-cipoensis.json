    "intro": "Pseudolaelia cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudolaelia cipoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
