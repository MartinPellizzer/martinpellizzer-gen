    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. trisecta, commonly known as the sand potentilla or three-lobed potentilla, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are divided into three lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
