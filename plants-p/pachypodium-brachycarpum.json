    "intro": "Pachypodium brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-stemmed bottle tree, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical trunk that stores water, a feature adapted to its arid environment. The plant has sparse, leathery leaves that reduce water loss and are often shed during dry periods. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, appearing at the top of the stem during the rainy season. Pachypodium brachycarpum is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
