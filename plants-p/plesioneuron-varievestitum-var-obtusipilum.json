    "intro": "Plesioneuron varievestitum var. obtusipilum, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species of fern characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its fronds are covered in fine, scale-like structures that help retain moisture. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
