    "intro": "Psoralea abbottii, commonly known as Abbott's psoralea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense spikes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Abbott's psoralea is a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
