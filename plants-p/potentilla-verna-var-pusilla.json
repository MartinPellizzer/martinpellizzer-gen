    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of the Americas. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with a mat-forming growth habit that allows it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to alpine and woodland environments. Its leaves are alternate, palmately divided, and covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, exposed conditions."
