    "intro": "Paepalanthus lychnophorellus, commonly known as the Andean star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in cool, arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
