    "intro": "Polypodium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features a robust rhizome and produces large, pinnately compound fronds with a distinctive, deeply divided structure. The fronds are typically evergreen and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to shaded environments. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the margins of the fronds."
