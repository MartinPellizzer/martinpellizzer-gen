    "intro": "Pilosella caespitosa subsp. pseudosudetorum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features hairy stems and leaves, which are typically covered in fine, white or pale-colored trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and meadows at high elevations. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
