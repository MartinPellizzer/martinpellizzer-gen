It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for several years. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fires and harsh environmental conditions. This species is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
