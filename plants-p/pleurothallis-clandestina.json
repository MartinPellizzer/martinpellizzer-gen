    "intro": "Pleurothallis clandestina, commonly known as the hidden pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the wet season. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
