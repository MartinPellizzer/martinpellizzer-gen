    "intro": "Philodendron scandens f. micans, commonly known as the velvet leaf philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
