    "intro": "Pteridrys malesiana, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Pteridrys malesiana plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
