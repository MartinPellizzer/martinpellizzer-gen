    "intro": "Pyrrocoma plantaginea, commonly known as the silverleaf pyrrocoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
