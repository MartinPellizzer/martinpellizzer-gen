    "intro": "Pleopeltis crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white tomentum. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, making it a common epiphyte or lithophyte. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its substrate, while its fronds are pinnately compound with serrated margins. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
