    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 charpentieri, commonly known as the evergreen potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is well-suited for coastal and sunny environments due to its drought tolerance and resistance to salt spray. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and erosion control."
