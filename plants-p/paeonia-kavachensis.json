    "intro": "Paeonia kavachensis, commonly known as the Kavach Mountain peony, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Nepal. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several elliptical leaflets, and it produces distinctive, woody stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paeonia kavachensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
