    "intro": "Potamogeton robbinsii f. cultellatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender leaves that are usually narrow and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Its small, green flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by water. This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
