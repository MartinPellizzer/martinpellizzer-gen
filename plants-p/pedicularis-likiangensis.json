    "intro": "Pedicularis likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
