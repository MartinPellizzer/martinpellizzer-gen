    "intro": "Pyrola blanda, commonly known as the common wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial found in the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Pyrola blanda thrives in acidic, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
