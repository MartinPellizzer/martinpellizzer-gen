    "intro": "Phyllorkis reinwardtii, commonly known as the Reinwardt's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a hardy but slow-growing species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
