    "intro": "Pteris furunculata, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris furunculata is well adapted to humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
