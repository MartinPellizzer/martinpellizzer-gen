    "intro": "Phagnalon pumilum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth phagnalon, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils in Europe. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, short hairs, though the variety 'glabrum' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
