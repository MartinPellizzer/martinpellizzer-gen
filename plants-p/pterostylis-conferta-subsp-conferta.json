    "intro": "Pterostylis conferta subsp. conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, greenish-yellow orchid flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to its scent and appearance. The species is relatively rare and is listed as vulnerable in some regions due to habitat loss and degradation."
