    "intro": "Pouteria ovata, commonly known as the \"Brazil nut tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing edible seeds. The tree's most notable feature is its production of Brazil nuts, which are enclosed within a hard, three-chambered pod. Pouteria ovata thrives in humid, warm climates and requires a well-drained soil with adequate sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
