    "intro": "Penstemon petiolatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular plant in native plant gardens."
