    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. elicinii, commonly known as the Scottish pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to Scotland and northern England. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones are woody and can persist on the tree for several years before opening to release seeds. This variety is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments, thriving in well-drained soils and moderate climates. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
