    "intro": "Potentilla nubicola, commonly known as the Ethiopian cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine environment. It has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Potentilla nubicola is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
