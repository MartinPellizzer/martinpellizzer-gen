It features small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with wiry, slender stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Potentilla rigoana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
