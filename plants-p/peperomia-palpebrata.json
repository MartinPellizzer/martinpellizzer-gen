    "intro": "Peperomia palpebrata, commonly known as the Eyelash Peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance houseplant native to Central and South America. It features dense, fleshy, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins, giving it a unique, almost eyelash-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for tabletop displays and hanging baskets."
