    "intro": "Parietaria cardiostegia, commonly known as the heart-leaved parietaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. The plant has lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in the summer months. Parietaria cardiostegia is also known for its allergenic properties, as it can cause skin irritation and respiratory symptoms in sensitive individuals."
