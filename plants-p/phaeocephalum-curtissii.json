    "intro": "Phaeocephalum curtissii, commonly known as the blackstem currant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically black when mature, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Phaeocephalum curtissii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
