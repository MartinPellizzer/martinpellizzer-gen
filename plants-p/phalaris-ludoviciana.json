It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces loose, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. It is often found in areas with high moisture and is adapted to tolerate flooding. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
