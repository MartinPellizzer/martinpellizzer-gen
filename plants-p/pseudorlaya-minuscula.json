    "intro": "Pseudorlaya minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf pseudorlaya, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
