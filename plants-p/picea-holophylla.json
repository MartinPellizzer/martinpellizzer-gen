    "intro": "Picea holophylla, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive white or pale green bark. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needle-like leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Picea holophylla plays an important ecological role in boreal and subarctic forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
