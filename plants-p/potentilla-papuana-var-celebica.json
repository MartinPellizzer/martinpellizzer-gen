    "intro": "Potentilla papuana var. celebica, commonly known as the Celebes potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the island of Celebes (Sulawesi) in Indonesia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with multiple stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
