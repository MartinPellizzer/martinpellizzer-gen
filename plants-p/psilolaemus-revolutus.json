    "intro": "Psilolaemus revolutus, commonly known as the warty tree frog, is a species of tree frog native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive warty skin and vibrant coloration, which helps it blend into its forest habitat. The plant aspect of this species refers to its reliance on specific vegetation for shelter and breeding. It typically inhabits the understory of dense tropical forests, where it finds moisture and protection. The frog's life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable plants for egg-laying and tadpole development."
