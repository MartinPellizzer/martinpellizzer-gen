    "intro": "Polystichum auriculatum var. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled at the tips. The fronds are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long and have a leathery texture with a serrated margin. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
