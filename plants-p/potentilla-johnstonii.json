    "intro": "Potentilla johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
