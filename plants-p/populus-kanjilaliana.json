    "intro": "Populus kanjilaliana, commonly known as the Kanjilalian poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in moist woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
