    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. carinata, commonly known as sea plantain or beach plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal environments. It is a herbaceous perennial with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks. It is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils, making it a common sight along shorelines. Its robust growth and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions make it an important pioneer species in maritime ecosystems."
