    "intro": "Pouzolzia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed pouzolzia, is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology. It is a shrub-like plant that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The leaves are elongated and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, with a prominent midrib running along their length. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and the plant produces small, three-lobed fruits. Pouzolzia longipes is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
