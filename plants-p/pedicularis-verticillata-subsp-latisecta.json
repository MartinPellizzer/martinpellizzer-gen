    "intro": "Pedicularis verticillata subsp. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leafed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are broadly ovate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This subspecies is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic or hemiparasitic relationships with host plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes."
