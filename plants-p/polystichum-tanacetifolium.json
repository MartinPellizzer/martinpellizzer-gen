    "intro": "Polystichum tanacetifolium, commonly known as the yew fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It features dark green, leathery, and lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with red or brown at the base. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. The yew fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
