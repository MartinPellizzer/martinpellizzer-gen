    "intro": "Prosopis odorata, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellow flowers and compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Its pods contain edible seeds that are a traditional food source for many indigenous communities. Prosopis odorata also plays a role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
