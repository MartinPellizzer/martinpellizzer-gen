It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often with a subtle pinkish hue. The plant features deeply lobed, dark green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
