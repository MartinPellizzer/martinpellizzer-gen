    "intro": "Phegopteris multilineata, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Phegopteris multilineata is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
