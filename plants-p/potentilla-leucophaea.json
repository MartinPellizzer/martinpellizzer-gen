    "intro": "Potentilla leucophaea, commonly known as white-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-white to gray-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Potentilla leucophaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and modest blooms."
