    "intro": "Pellaea bella, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features delicate, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, giving it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It produces spores in tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes."
