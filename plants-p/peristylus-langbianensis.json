    "intro": "Peristylus langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian peristylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes approximately 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems, which are adaptations to its high-altitude habitat. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
