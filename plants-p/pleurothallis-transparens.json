    "intro": "Pleurothallis transparens, commonly known as the transparent orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its translucent petals and greenish-yellow sepals make it a striking yet subtle addition to botanical collections. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
