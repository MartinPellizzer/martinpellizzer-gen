    "intro": "Pleopeltis holophylla, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The silver fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
