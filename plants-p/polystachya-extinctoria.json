    "intro": "Polystachya extinctoria, commonly known as the extinct fire plant, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its unique ability to produce a volatile oil that can temporarily incapacitate small animals, which is thought to aid in its defense against herbivores. Its habitat typically includes moist, shaded forest understories where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Polystachya extinctoria is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
