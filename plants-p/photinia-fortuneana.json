    "intro": "Photinia fortuneana, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking foliage, which turns a brilliant red in the fall. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while the plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil conditions. The fruit is a small, round drupe that ripens to a dark red color."
