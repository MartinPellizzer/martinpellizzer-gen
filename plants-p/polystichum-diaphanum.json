    "intro": "Polystichum diaphanum, commonly known as the translucent fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, translucent scales, giving it a unique, ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its fronds can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, with a bipinnate structure that adds to its ornamental value. Polystichum diaphanum is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
