It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and sparse, narrow leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
