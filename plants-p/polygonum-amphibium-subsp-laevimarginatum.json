    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium subsp. laevimarginatum, commonly known as the broad-margin smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with smooth, broad margins, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in riparian zones and along the edges of ponds. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and its role in supporting local wildlife. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
