    "intro": "Pilocereus macrocephalus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a distinctive appearance due to its colorful, often vibrant, top portion, which is actually a grafted variety of another cactus species. It is a succulent plant that stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Pilocereus macrocephalus is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
