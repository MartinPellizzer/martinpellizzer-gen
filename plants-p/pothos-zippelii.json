    "intro": "Pothos zippelii, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more renowned for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in low-light conditions and is highly tolerant of neglect, making it a popular houseplant. Its ability to climb or trail makes it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves."
