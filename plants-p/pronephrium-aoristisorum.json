    "intro": "Pronephrium aoristisorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are narrow and often arranged in whorls, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. The botanical features of Pronephrium aoristisorum make it an interesting subject for studies on carnivorous plant adaptations."
