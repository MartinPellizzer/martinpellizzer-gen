    "intro": "Papistylus intropubens, commonly known as the moonshade fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft blue glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil of its habitat. Its reproductive cycle involves the production of spores rather than seeds, typical of ferns. The leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, providing efficient light capture in the shaded understory of the forest."
