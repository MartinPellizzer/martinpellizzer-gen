It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Puccinellia canbyi is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
