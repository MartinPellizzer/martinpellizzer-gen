    "intro": "Polypodium blandum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to North America. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, delicate fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium blandum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and woodland settings."
