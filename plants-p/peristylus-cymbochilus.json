It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related genera. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
