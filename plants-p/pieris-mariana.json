    "intro": "Pieris mariana, commonly known as the eastern piedmont laurel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a notable species in native plant gardens."
