    "intro": "Pinus nigra subsp. croatica, commonly known as the Croatian black pine, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and conical shape, typical of many pine species. The needles are typically longer than those of other Pinus species, and the cones are often reddish-brown when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
