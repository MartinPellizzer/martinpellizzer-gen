    "intro": "Poponax houghii, commonly known as the Hough's poponax, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender stems and delicate, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poponax houghii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
