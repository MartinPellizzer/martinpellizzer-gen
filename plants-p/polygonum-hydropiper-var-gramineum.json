    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper var. gramineum, commonly known as water pepper, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments. It features erect, branched stems covered with small, translucent glands that exude a peppery scent when crushed. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. This plant is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
