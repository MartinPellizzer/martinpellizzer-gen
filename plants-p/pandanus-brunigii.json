It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spikes at the top of the foliage. Its fibrous leaves are valued for their strength and durability, making them useful in basket weaving and thatching.
