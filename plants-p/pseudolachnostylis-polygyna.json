    "intro": "Pseudolachnostylis polygyna, commonly known as the slender leek, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
