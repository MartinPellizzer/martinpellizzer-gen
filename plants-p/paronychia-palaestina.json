    "intro": "Paronychia palaestina, commonly known as the Jordanian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, coastal areas. Paronychia palaestina is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
