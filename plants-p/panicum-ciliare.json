It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and slender, spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for downy feathers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along waterways. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and native plant gardens."
