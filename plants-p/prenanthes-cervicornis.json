    "intro": "Prenanthes cervicornis, commonly known as the horned evening-primrose, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the evening-primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators like moths and beetles. Its distinctive horn-like bracts give it its common name, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in wet conditions. Prenanthes cervicornis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
