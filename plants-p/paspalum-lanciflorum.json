    "intro": "Paspalum lanciflorum, commonly known as the swordgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in areas with high soil moisture. Paspalum lanciflorum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
