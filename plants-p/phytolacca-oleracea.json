    "intro": "Phytolacca oleracea, commonly known as the common pokeweed, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lobed leaves that are often green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
