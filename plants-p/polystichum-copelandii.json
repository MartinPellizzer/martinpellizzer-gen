    "intro": "Polystichum copelandii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive golden-yellow margin that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a dense, feathery appearance."
