    "intro": "Pachystoma formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
