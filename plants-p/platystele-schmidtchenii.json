    "intro": "Platystele schmidtchenii, commonly known as the Schmidtchen's ghost plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology characterized by its slender, leafless stem and a single, showy, white flower. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its flowers are ephemeral, blooming briefly before withering, and it reproduces through seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
