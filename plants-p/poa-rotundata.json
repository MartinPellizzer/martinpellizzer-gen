    "intro": "Poa rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and its distinctive round, blunt-ended leaves. The plant produces small, blue-green spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Poa rotundata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
