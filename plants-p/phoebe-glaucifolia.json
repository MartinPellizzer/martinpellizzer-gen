The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Phoebe glaucifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
