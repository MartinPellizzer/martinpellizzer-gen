    "intro": "Polystichum dissimulans, commonly known as the hidden fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the cool, moist forests of Japan. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are tightly curled when young and unfurl gradually as they mature. The plant typically grows in shaded, rocky habitats and forms dense colonies through its rhizomatous growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum dissimulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
