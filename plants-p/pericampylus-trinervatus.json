    "intro": "Pericampylus trinervatus, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with three prominent veins running along the length of each leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in the presence of high humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
