    "intro": "Peltaea nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem pella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped or kidney-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
