    "intro": "Populus helvetica, commonly known as the European aspen, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by samaras, which are winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. Populus helvetica plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and is valued for its ecological and historical significance."
