    "intro": "Phleum arenarium subsp. aegaeum, commonly known as the Aegean grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils in arid and semi-arid habitats."
