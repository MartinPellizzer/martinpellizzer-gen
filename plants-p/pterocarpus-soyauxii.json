    "intro": "Pterocarpus soyauxii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its density and appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
