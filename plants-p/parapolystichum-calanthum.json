    "intro": "Parapolystichum calanthum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a golden or bronze hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
