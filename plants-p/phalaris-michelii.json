    "intro": "Phalaris michelii, commonly known as Michel's wild oat, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed coastal habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
