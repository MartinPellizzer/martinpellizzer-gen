    "intro": "Petasites arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Petasites arcticus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
