    "intro": "Peponium perrieri var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-fruited pepo, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy fruit surface and compact, sprawling growth habit. The plant typically produces small, elongated fruits with a pale green to yellowish coloration. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturalists alike."
