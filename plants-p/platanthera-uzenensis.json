    "intro": "Platanthera uzenensis, commonly known as the Uzen marsh twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. It has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
