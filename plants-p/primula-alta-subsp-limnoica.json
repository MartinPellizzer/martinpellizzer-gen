    "intro": "Primula alta subsp. limnoica, commonly known as the water primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies such as lakes, ponds, and streams. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its showy, violet to blue-purple flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in early spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
