    "intro": "Pleurothallis graciliscapa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
