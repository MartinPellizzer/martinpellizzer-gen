    "intro": "Parinari latifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved parinari, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Parinari latifrons is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
