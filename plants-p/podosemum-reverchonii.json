    "intro": "Podosemum reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's podosemum, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and has palmate leaves with a velvety texture. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
