It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to moderately wet soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, characteristic of the Poaceae family. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
