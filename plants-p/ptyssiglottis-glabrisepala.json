    "intro": "Ptyssiglottis glabrisepala, commonly known as the smooth-sepal ptyssiglottis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are berries that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
