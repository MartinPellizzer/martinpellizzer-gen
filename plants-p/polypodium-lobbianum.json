    "intro": "Polypodium lobbianum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. This plant is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself in difficult terrain. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released when the leaves mature."
