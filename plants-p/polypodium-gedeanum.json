    "intro": "Polypodium gedeanum, commonly known as the Gedean's fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Polypodium gedeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
