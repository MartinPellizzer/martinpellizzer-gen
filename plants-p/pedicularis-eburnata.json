It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
