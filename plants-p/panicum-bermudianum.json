    "intro": "Panicum bermudianum, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda and the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, which allows it to form a thick, sod-forming turf. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a common choice for lawns and pastures. Its reproductive strategy involves both vegetative spread and seed production, contributing to its widespread distribution."
