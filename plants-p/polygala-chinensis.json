    "intro": "Polygala chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are usually pink or white, with a distinctive spurred petal. Polygala chinensis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
