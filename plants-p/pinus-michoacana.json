    "intro": "Pinus michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan pine, is a species of conifer native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain seeds used by various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
