    "intro": "Psilotrichum capitatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Psilotrichum capitatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Its simple structure and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution."
