It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and dry meadows. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.
