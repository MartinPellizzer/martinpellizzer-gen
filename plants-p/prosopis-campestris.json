    "intro": "Prosopis campestris, commonly known as the mesquite tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. Its pods contain seeds that are used for food by both wildlife and humans, and the wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
