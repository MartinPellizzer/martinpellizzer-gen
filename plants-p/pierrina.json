    "intro": "Pierrina, commonly known as the \"rock rose,\" is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus *Cistus* in the family Cistaceae, characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are typically leathery and covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pierrina is well adapted to rocky and coastal soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
