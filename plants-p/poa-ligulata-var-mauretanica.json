    "intro": "Poa ligulata var. mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often form dense mats. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sun-exposed habitats. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-rowed florets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dry garden settings due to its drought tolerance."
