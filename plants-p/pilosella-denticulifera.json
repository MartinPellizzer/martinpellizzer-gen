    "intro": "Pilosella denticulifera, commonly known as the toothed leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, producing small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pilosella denticulifera is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
