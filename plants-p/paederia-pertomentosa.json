    "intro": "Paederia pertomentosa, commonly known as the Chinese nettle or stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, stinging texture on the underside, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the spring. Paederia pertomentosa is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
