    "intro": "Penstemon ambiguus var. ambiguus, commonly known as the narrowleaf penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright, branched stems that bear whorled leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
