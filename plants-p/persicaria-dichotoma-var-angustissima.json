    "intro": "Persicaria dichotoma var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters at the tips of the stems, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other wetland habitats. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
