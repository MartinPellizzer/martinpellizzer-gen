    "intro": "Pilea ophiticola, commonly known as the stone liver plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or in rocky crevices. Due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
