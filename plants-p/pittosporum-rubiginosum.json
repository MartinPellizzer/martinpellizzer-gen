It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant, reddish-pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, oval berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
