It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically pink to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common ornamental in warm climates. Its botanical characteristics make it suitable for erosion control and as a landscape plant in suitable environments."
