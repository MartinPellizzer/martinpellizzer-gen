    "intro": "Pimpinella idae, commonly known as the Ida mountain cow-wheat, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Ida Mountains in Turkey. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pimpinella idae is considered a vulnerable species."
