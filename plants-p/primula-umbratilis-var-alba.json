    "intro": "Primula umbratilis var. alba, commonly known as the white shade-loving primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in woodland floors or rocky crevices. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation and is often grown in garden settings with specific humidity and light conditions."
