    "intro": "Phegopteris aspidioides, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that supports its extensive foliage. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, wavy margin that adds to its ornamental appeal. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typically near the margins."
