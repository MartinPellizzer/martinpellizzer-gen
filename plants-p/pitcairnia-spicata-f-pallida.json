    "intro": "Pitcairnia spicata f. pallida, commonly known as the pale-flowered pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant produces sword-shaped, glossy leaves that form a rosette, creating a striking visual contrast with its pale blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often grown in greenhouse or indoor settings."
