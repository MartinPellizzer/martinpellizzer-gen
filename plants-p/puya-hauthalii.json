    "intro": "Puya hauthalii, commonly known as the Hauthal's torchflower, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, with vibrant red and orange bracts. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or sunny slopes. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, forming a water-holding structure typical of bromeliads. Puya hauthalii is known for its longevity, with some plants living over a century before blooming for the first time."
