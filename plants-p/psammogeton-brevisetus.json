    "intro": "Psammogeton brevisetus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its seeds are enclosed in small, bead-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Psammogeton brevisetus is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
