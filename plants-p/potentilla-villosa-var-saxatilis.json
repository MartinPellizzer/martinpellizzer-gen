    "intro": "Potentilla villosa var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rough cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to rocky and alpine regions of North America. It features small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often grayish-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, cliffs, and slopes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
