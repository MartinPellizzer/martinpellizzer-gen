    "intro": "Pedicularis resupinata var. crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-stemmed lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, reddish stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is notable for its unique floral structure, which resembles a cluster of small, spurred orchids."
