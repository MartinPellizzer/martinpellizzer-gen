It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is also cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
