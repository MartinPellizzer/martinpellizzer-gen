    "intro": "Pityrogramma calomelanos var. ochracea, commonly known as the ochraceous water clover, is a variant of the water clover species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae, characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that resemble clover leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, ochraceous (yellowish-orange) coating, which gives it its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant."
