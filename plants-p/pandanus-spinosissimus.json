    "intro": "Pandanus spinosissimus, commonly known as the spiny pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the leaves. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in coastal and sandy soils. The spiny pandanus is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in many island communities."
