    "intro": "Platanthera galeandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America, particularly found in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many regions."
