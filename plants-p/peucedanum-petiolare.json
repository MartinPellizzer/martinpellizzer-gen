    "intro": "Peucedanum petiolare, commonly known as the slender cow parsley, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. Its seeds are small and oval, often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Peucedanum petiolare thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
