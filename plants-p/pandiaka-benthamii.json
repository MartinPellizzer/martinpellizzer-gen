It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pandiaka benthamii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
