    "intro": "Parapolystichum effusum var. effusum, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a shade-loving plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often arched or clustered. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant, decorative foliage plants."
