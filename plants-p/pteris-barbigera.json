It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered with fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pteris barbigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
