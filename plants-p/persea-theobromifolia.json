    "intro": "Persea theobromifolia, commonly known as the chocolate tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is notable for its fruit, which resembles a small, round berry and contains a single seed. Theobromine, a compound found in its seeds, is also present in cocoa beans, though it is not used in chocolate production. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
