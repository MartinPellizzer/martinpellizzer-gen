    "intro": "Phaseolus gonospermos var. lividus, commonly known as the dark-seeded runner bean, is a variant of the runner bean species native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black seeds and elongated, cylindrical pods that mature to a yellowish-green color. The plant is an annual legume that thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with a rough texture, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. This variety is valued for its culinary uses, as the tender pods can be harvested and cooked like green beans."
