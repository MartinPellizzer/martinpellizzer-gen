    "intro": "Paloue induta subsp. induta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become an invasive species in some regions."
