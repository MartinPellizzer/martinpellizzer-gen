    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis subsinuata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its compact, often pendulous growth habit and its striking, fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, which helps it capture light in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Pleurothallis subsinuata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
