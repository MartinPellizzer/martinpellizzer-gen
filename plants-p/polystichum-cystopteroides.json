    "intro": "Polystichum cystopteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Polystichum cystopteroides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various garden conditions."
