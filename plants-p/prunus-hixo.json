    "intro": "Prunus hixo, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are edible but not as widely consumed as other apricot varieties. Prunus hixo is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
