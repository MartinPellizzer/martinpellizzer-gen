    "intro": "Pronephrium manuselense, commonly known as the Manuselense kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Pronephrium manuselense thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
