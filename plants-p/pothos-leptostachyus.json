    "intro": "Pothos leptostachyus, commonly known as the silver pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically variegated with shades of white and green. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are not particularly showy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular houseplant. Its rapid growth habit makes it ideal for hanging baskets or trained on trellises."
