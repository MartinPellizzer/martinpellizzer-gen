    "intro": "Paullinia cartagenensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapindaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
