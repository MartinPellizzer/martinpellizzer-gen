    "intro": "Pterygota colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian winged fern, is a unique plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a leathery texture and a wing-like structure on the underside. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground, forming dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that provide a delicate, feathery appearance. Pterygota colombiana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid cloud forests."
