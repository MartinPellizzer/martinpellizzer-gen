    "intro": "Paeonia altaica, commonly known as the Altai peony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Paeoniaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help the plant survive harsh environmental conditions. Paeonia altaica is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
