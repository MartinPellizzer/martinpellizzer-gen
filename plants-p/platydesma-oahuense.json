    "intro": "Platydesma oahuense, commonly known as the Oahu flatleaf, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
