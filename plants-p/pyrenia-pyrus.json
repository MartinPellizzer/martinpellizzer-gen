    "intro": "Pyrenia pyrus, commonly known as the common blackcap, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Pyrenia pyrus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
