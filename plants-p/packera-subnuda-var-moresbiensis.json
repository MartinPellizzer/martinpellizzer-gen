    "intro": "Packera subnuda var. moresbiensis, commonly known as the Moresby's sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, silvery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically from November to February. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
