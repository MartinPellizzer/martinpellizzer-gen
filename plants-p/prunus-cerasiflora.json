    "intro": "Prunus cerasiflora, commonly known as the cherry plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, sweet-tart fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other plums. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture and turn yellow in the fall. Prunus cerasiflora is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy blossoms and compact growth habit."
