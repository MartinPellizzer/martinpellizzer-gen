    "intro": "Prunus persica f. rubroplena, commonly known as the double-flowered peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its unique floral structure. It features double blooms with multiple layers of petals, giving it a more elaborate and showy appearance compared to typical peaches. The plant retains the general morphology of the Prunus persica species, including its fruiting habit and growth pattern. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. The fruit, while edible, may be smaller and less flavorful than standard peaches."
