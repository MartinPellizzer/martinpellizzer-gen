    "intro": "Pariana bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored pariana, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, which typically display a combination of white and violet hues. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom during the warmer months of the year. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pariana bicolor is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils."
