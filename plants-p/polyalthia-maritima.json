    "intro": "Polyalthia maritima, commonly known as the coastal satinash, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove or brackish water areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
