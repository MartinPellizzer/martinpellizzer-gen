    "intro": "Pyrus syrmiensis, commonly known as the Sirmium pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is typically small, with a thin skin and a sweet, aromatic flavor. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and historical significance. Unfortunately, it is now considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
