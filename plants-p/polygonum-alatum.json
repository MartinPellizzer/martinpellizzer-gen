    "intro": "Polygonum alatum, commonly known as the winged knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves with prominent veins that run along the edges, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Polygonum alatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
