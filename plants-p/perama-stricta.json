It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered closely together. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to parts of Australia and is often found in eucalyptus forests. Its botanical features make it an important part of the ecosystem, supporting various bird species."
