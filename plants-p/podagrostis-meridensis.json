    "intro": "Podagrostis meridensis, commonly known as the southern basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a compact panicle with spikelets that are loosely arranged. Podagrostis meridensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in marginal environments."
