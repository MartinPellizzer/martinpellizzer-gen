    "intro": "Paspalum furcatum var. villosum, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and often hairy, contributing to its adaptability in various environmental conditions. This grass is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
