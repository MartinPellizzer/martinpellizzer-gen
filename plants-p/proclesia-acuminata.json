    "intro": "Proclesia acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves. It typically attaches to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host."
