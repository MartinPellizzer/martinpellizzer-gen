    "intro": "Piletophyllum micropetalum subsp. byssitectum, commonly known as the silky-leaved rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine and rocky habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful monitoring."
