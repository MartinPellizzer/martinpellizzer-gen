    "intro": "Pseudalthenia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Pseudalthenia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of moisture and light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
