    "intro": "Petiniotia, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the Brassicaceae family. These plants are typically small, herbaceous species that thrive in rocky or arid environments. They are characterized by their basal leaves and small, cruciform flowers that often have four petals. Petiniotia species are often found in alpine or coastal regions where they can tolerate harsh conditions. Their ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils makes them an important part of their ecosystem."
