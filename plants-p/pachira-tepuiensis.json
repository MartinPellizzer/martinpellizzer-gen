    "intro": "Pachira tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui pachira, is a species of flowering plant native to the tepuis of southern Venezuela and northern Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Pachira tepuiensis is adapted to the unique microclimates of the tepuis, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
