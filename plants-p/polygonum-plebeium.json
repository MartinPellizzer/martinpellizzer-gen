    "intro": "Polygonum plebeium, commonly known as common knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a reddish tint and are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer."
