It typically grows in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine.
