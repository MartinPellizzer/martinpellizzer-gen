    "intro": "Poa kolymensis, commonly known as the Kolyma grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, silver-green leaves that are adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Poa kolymensis plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for herbivores in its native environment."
