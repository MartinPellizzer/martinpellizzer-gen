    "intro": "Psammophila floribunda, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant adapted to arid environments. It is native to regions of North Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. Its foliage consists of narrow, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. Psammophila floribunda plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
