    "intro": "Premna wightiana, commonly known as Indian nettle or velvet leaf, is a flowering plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, featuring opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture, and they have a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
