    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 uyekii, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus mandshurica and Prunus trichocarpa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The plant produces showy, single or double flowers in shades of white to pink, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its fruit is a small, yellow or orange drupe that ripens in late summer. The Japanese apricot is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its floral display."
