    "intro": "Populus nigra f. italica, commonly known as the Italian black poplar, is a cultivar of the black poplar tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. This variety is often found growing near water bodies such as rivers and lakes, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its spread. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and reforestation projects."
