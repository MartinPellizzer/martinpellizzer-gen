    "intro": "Pararistolochia kepara, commonly known as the kepara pipevine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble pipes, which give it its common name. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its aromatic, often fragrant blooms. Its stems are typically woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread across trees and shrubs. However, it contains toxic compounds and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens due to its potential hazards."
