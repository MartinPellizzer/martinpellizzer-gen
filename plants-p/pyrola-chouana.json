    "intro": "Pyrola chouana, commonly known as the Chouan's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring, which are often hidden among its dense leaves. Its leaves are thick, waxy, and dark green, adapted to thrive in shaded, moist forest environments. Pyrola chouana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in woodland ecosystems."
