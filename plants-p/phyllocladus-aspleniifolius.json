    "intro": "Phyllocladus aspleniifolius, commonly known as the silver pine, is a member of the Podocarpaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a coniferous tree characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and distinctive, elongated cones. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation where its leaves are modified into scale-like structures, reducing water loss in its native, often harsh climate. It typically grows in coastal or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in M\u0101ori culture."
