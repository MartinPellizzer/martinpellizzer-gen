It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces clusters of yellowish to brownish spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and tapering, with a rough texture. Panicum phaeocarpum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
