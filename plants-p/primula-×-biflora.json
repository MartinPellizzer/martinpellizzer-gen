    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 biflora, commonly known as the double primrose, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of double, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, featuring petals that are often more numerous and layered than those of its parent species. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its long-lasting floral display."
