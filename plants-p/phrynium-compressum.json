    "intro": "Phrynium compressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomes are used as a starch source, similar to arrowroot, and the plant is often grown for its ornamental value. Phrynium compressum thrives in moist, shady environments and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm climates."
