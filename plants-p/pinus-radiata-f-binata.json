    "intro": "Pinus radiata f. binata, commonly known as the silver pine, is a variant of the radiata pine, characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue foliage. This form exhibits a unique branching pattern, with multiple shoots emerging from the same node, creating a more open and irregular canopy. It is native to the coastal regions of New Zealand and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in reforestation efforts. Its cones are typically smaller and more clustered compared to the typical form of Pinus radiata."
