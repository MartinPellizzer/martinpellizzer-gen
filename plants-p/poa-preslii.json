    "intro": "Poa preslii, commonly known as the Preslii bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
