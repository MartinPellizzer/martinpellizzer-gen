    "intro": "Pelecyphora abdita subsp. abdita, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often blooming in late winter to early spring. It is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it well-suited for its specific ecological niche."
