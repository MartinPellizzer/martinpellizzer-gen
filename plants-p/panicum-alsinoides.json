    "intro": "Panicum alsinoides, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a native grass species found in sandy and gravelly soils across the central and eastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, airy panicles of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its fine texture and subtle appearance make it an attractive addition to naturalistic landscapes. Panicum alsinoides also plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators and small wildlife."
