    "intro": "Panicum scabrum var. submuticum, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a variant of the panicgrass genus characterized by its coarse, fibrous texture. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, scaly surface, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, bristly florets. It is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
