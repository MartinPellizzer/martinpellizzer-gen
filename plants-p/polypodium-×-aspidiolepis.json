    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 aspidiolepis, commonly known as the hybrid wall fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between *Polypodium vulgare* and *Polypodium polypodium*. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually light green to grayish in color. It produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are released during the spring and early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
