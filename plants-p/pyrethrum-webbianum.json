    "intro": "Pyrethrum webbianum, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow petals and a central disk. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which are responsible for its insecticidal properties. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of these microscopic hairs. Pyrethrum webbianum is cultivated for its natural pyrethrins, which are used in organic pest control."
