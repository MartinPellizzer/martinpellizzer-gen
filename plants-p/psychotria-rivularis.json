    "intro": "Psychotria rivularis, commonly known as the river psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, white to greenish flowers clustered in cymes. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Psychotria rivularis is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine."
