    "intro": "Pimpinella thomasii, commonly known as Thomas' cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. Native to the western United States, particularly California, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit that splits open upon maturity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
