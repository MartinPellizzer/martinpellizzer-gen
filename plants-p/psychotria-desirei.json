    "intro": "Psychotria desirei, commonly known as the Amazonian psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its cultural and medicinal significance, it is also of interest to botanists and ethnobotrists."
