    "intro": "Polypodium eilophyllum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow on rocks or tree trunks. The plant's rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and can vary in color from bright green to a more muted hue depending on environmental conditions. Polypodium eilophyllum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
