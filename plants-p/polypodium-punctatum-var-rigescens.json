    "intro": "Polypodium punctatum var. rigescens, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its distinctive appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
