    "intro": "Pilosella longipila, commonly known as the long-haired mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Pilosella longipila is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to harsh, high-altitude environments."
