    "intro": "Pteris pedicellata, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, which helps in attracting certain pollinators."
