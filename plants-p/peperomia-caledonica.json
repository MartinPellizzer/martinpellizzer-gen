    "intro": "Peperomia caledonica, commonly known as the Caledonian peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
