    "intro": "Phyllanthus sandwicensis var. parvifolius, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwicensis phyllanthus, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mesic forests on the islands of Hawaii. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
