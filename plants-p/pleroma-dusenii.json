    "intro": "Pleroma dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's pleroma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleroma dusenii is considered a rare and endangered species."
