    "intro": "Picea abies var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Norway spruce, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, dense branches, which give it a spherical or cushion-like appearance. The foliage consists of dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard Norway spruce. This variety is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in poor, rocky soils and cold climates. It is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its unique size and hardy nature."
