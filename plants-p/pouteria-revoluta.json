    "intro": "Pouteria revoluta, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which contains the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are enclosed within a hard, woody capsule. Pouteria revoluta plays an important ecological role in the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
