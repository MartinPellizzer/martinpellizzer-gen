    "intro": "Paphiopedilum armeniacum var. markii, commonly known as the Armenian slipper orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and surrounding areas. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped lip that is often a striking shade of pink or red, which plays a key role in attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with fleshy roots and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It prefers cool, humid environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions to ensure its survival."
