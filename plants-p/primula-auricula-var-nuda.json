    "intro": "Primula auricula var. nuda, commonly known as the naked ear primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard Primula auricula, giving it a unique appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
