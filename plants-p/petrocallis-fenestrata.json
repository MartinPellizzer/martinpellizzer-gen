    "intro": "Petrocallis fenestrata, commonly known as the windowed rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, fenestrated (window-like) leaves that are often divided into narrow, toothed segments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its unique leaf structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
