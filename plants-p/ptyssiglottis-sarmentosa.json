    "intro": "Ptyssiglottis sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping ptyssiglottis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant features slender, climbing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or up vegetation. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and usually have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and are typically greenish or yellowish in color, contributing to its modest appearance."
