    "intro": "Polygala decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Polygala decumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
