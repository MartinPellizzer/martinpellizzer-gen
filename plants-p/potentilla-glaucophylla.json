    "intro": "Potentilla glaucophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Potentilla glaucophylla is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
