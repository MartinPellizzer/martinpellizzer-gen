    "intro": "Potentilla forrestii var. caespitosa, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a compact, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth pattern, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, adding a bright contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to rocky soils and cold climates, making it a hardy choice for gardeners in cooler regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its tidy growth habit and long blooming period."
