    "intro": "Polystachya tenella, commonly known as the silver vellum fern, is a member of the Polystachyaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its delicate, hair-like fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white to pale green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Polystachya tenella is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique aesthetic appeal."
