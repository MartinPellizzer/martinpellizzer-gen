    "intro": "Pteris acclivis, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the soil. Pteris acclivis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
