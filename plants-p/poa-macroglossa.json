    "intro": "Poa macroglossa, commonly known as the giant sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Poa macroglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rugged landscapes."
