    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 kuratae, commonly known as the Kurata's wood fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum milleflorum. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
