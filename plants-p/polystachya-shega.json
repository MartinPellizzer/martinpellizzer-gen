    "intro": "Polystachya shega, commonly known as the shega orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky areas. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Polystachya shega is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
