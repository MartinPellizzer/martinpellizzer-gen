    "intro": "Phoebe cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf phoebe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and native landscaping."
