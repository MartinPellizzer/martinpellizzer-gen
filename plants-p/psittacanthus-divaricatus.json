    "intro": "Psittacanthus divaricatus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a fern that typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with bright yellow to orange spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered around the leaf bases. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, fan-shaped appearance with a waxy surface. Psittacanthus divaricatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in hanging baskets or as a decorative houseplant."
