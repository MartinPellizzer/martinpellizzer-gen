    "intro": "Picea mariana f. semiprostrata, commonly known as the creeping black spruce, is a low-growing variant of the black spruce native to northern North America. This form exhibits a prostrate growth habit, with sprawling branches that often form dense mats on the ground. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, providing effective wind protection. The cones are typically small and conical, maturing to release seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forests and peatlands."
