    "intro": "Phylica imberbis, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, which are typically red or orange in color. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing along the edges of the sea. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, nectar-rich flowers that attract birds and insects. Phylica imberbis is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in maritime climates."
