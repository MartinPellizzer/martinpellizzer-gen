    "intro": "Preslianthus pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's sycamore, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, and is often found in humid, lowland forests. Its seeds are encased in pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in suitable habitats. Due to habitat loss, Preslianthus pittieri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
