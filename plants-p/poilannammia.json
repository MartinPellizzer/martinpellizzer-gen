    "intro": "Poilannammia, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, reflective hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to two meters in height. Poilannammia is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
