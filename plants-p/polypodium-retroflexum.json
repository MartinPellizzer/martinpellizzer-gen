    "intro": "Polypodium retroflexum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
