    "intro": "Pilea cruegeriana, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a popular houseplant native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It features round, glossy leaves that resemble coins, which is why it has earned its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea cruegeriana is known for its ease of care and ability to purify indoor air."
