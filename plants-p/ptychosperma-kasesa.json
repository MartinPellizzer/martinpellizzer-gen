    "intro": "Ptychosperma kasesa, commonly known as the Kasesa palm, is a species of cycad native to the rainforests of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
