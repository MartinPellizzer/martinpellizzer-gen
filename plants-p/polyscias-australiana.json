It features compound leaves that are typically alternate and can be either pinnate or palmate, depending on the variety. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its foliage is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide dense shade."
