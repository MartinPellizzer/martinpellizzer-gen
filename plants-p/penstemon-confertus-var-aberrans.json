    "intro": "Penstemon confertus var. aberrans, commonly known as the Sierra penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats and alpine meadows, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variant is noted for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in mountainous regions."
