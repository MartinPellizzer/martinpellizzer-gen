It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has erect, slender stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Polygonum paludicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
