It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, prostrate growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. The subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is a common component of spinifex grasslands."
