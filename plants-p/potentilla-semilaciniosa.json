It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a resilient and ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
