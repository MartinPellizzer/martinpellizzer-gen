    "intro": "Photinia impressivena, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, glossy red foliage that turns vibrant shades of orange and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit."
