    "intro": "Platanthera petitiana, commonly known as the Petit's lady's tresses, is an orchid species native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a distinctive inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose, loose raceme. The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. It is a perennial herb that typically reaches a height of 20\u201340 cm. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
