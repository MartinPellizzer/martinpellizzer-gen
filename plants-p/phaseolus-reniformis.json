    "intro": "Phaseolus reniformis, commonly known as the kidney bean, is a leguminous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves and pods that contain round, kidney-shaped seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in warm, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, and it is an important crop for its high protein content. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules makes it beneficial for soil fertility."
