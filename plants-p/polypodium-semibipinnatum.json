    "intro": "Polypodium semibipinnatum, commonly known as the semi-bipinnate fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a finely textured appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a light green color and a slightly serrated edge."
