    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and long, slender stems that bear clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It is a hybrid species, resulting from crosses between different species of Platanthera, which contributes to its genetic diversity. The flowers are typically arranged in a loose raceme and are pollinated by various insects, including flies and beetles."
