    "intro": "Podalyria pulcherrima, commonly known as the flame violet, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Podalyria pulcherrima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight."
