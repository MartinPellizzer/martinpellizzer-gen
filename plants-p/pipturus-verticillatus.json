    "intro": "Pipturus verticillatus, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often clustered in whorls of three to five, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
