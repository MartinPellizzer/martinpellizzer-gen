It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure with small, white flowers. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in sandy or muddy substrates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to marine botanists and conservationists."
