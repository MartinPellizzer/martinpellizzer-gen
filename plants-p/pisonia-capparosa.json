    "intro": "Pisonia capparosa, commonly known as the coral tree, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its striking clusters of bright red or orange flowers that resemble coral, hence its common name. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture. Pisonia capparosa is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils."
