    "intro": "Peucedanum burnatianum, commonly known as Burnat's cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
