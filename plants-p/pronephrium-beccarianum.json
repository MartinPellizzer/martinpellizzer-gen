It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are typically small and often submerged in water, facilitating its carnivorous lifestyle. It thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, relying on its prey for essential nutrients. Its unique adaptations highlight the evolutionary strategies of aquatic carnivorous flora."
