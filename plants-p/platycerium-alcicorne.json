    "intro": "Platycerium alcicorne, commonly known as the glossy-leaf staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that emerge from a central rosette of broad, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its fronds are typically dark green with a waxy, glossy surface, and they can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. Platycerium alcicorne is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
