    "intro": "Peckia detergens, commonly known as the soapplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a soapy foam when its leaves are disturbed, which is a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The genus Peckia belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes other plants with similar morphological traits."
