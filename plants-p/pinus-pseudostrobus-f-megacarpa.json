    "intro": "Pinus pseudostrobus f. megacarpa, commonly known as the giant Mexican pine, is a variant of the Mexican pine characterized by its large, robust cones. It is native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico, where it thrives in temperate and subtropical climates. The plant is a coniferous evergreen with needle-like leaves and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its cones are notably larger than those of the typical species, often exceeding 20 centimeters in length. This botanical feature makes it distinctive and valuable for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
