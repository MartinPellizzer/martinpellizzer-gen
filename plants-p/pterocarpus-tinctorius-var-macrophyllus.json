It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and distinctive reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and commercial properties. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the extraction of natural dyes from its wood and leaves."
