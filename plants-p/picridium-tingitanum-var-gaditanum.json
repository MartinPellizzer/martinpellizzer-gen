It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sunny environments, often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
