It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
