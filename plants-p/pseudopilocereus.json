    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habits, with large, fragrant flowers that open at night. They are typically columnar in shape, with ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The flowers are usually white or pale in color, and they attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Pseudopilocereus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
