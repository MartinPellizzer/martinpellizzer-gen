    "intro": "Puya cardenasii, commonly known as the Cardenas puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in a single event before the plant dies. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and requires well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
