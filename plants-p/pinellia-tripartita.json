    "intro": "Pinellia tripartita, commonly known as the Chinese ginger or black ginger, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features a short, stocky stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its most distinctive feature is the spathe, a modified leaf that encloses the spadix, which bears small, inconspicuous flowers. Pinellia tripartita is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
