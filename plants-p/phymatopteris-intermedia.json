    "intro": "Phymatopteris intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wall fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
