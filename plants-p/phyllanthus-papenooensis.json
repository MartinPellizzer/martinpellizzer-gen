    "intro": "Phyllanthus papenooensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, green leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals, including livestock. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
