    "intro": "Pithocarpa ramosa, commonly known as the slender pithocarpa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branched structure and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its pithy stems are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name. Pithocarpa ramosa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
