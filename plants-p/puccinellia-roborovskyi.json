It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
