    "intro": "Pauletia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty pauletia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its scientific name reflects the reddish-brown coloration observed on its stems and leaves, which is a distinguishing feature of the species."
