    "intro": "Pachycymbium sacculatum, commonly known as the sacculated bulb orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like structures on its stems, which are believed to aid in water storage. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
