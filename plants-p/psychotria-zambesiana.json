    "intro": "Psychotria zambesiana, commonly known as the Zambesian Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a red calyx. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Psychotria zambesiana is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
