    "intro": "Platysace stephensonii, commonly known as the Stevenson's marshmallow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swampy forests and along riverbanks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
