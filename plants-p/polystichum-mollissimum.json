    "intro": "Polystichum mollissimum, commonly known as the silky cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are covered in a fine, silky layer of hair, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and absorb nutrients from the surrounding rock. The silky cliff brake is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
