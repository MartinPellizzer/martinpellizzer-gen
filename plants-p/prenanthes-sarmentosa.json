    "intro": "Prenanthes sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, often trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy surface and a prominent midrib, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered umbels. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
