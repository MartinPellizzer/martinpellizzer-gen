    "intro": "Phaius flavus, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has erect, grass-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
