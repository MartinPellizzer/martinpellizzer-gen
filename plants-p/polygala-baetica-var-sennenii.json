    "intro": "Polygala baetica var. sennenii, commonly known as the Spanish milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, showy flowers. The plant produces yellowish or greenish flowers that are clustered in spicate inflorescences, often with a distinctive, thread-like structure. It is well adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
