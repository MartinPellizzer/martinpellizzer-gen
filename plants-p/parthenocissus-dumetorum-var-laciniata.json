    "intro": "Parthenocissus dumetorum var. laciniata, commonly known as the scarlet climbing vine, is a deciduous woody vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a reddish tint when young. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread along fences, walls, and trellises. The leaves turn bright red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
