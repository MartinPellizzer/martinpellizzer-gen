    "intro": "Parodia andreae, commonly known as the Andean burrito cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and a crown of spiny, leaf-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom from the areoles along its stem. Parodia andreae is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
