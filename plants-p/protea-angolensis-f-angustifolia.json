It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that resemble a cluster of candles. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
