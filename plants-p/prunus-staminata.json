    "intro": "Prunus staminata, commonly known as the Chinese sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Prunus staminata is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
