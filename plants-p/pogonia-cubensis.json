    "intro": "Pogonia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Cuba. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring a single, slender stem and a single, showy flower that is typically white or pale pink. The plant has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range."
