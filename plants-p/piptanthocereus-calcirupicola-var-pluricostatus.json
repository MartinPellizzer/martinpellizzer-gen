    "intro": "Piptanthocereus calcirupicola var. pluricostatus, commonly known as the rock-cushion cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. This variety is particularly adapted to rocky soils, thriving on cliffs and rocky outcrops where it forms a dense, mat-like growth."
