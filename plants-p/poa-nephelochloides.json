    "intro": "Poa nephelochloides, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense mat-forming habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowering stems are short and bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets. Poa nephelochloides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
