    "intro": "Prunus longicaudata, commonly known as the Chinese white cherry, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates. Prunus longicaudata is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its potential health benefits."
