It features a smooth, pale green to white body with prominent, ribbed structure and a short, cylindrical stem. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for succulent collections and rock gardens."
