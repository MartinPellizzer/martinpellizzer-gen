    "intro": "Poa pseudamabilis, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Poa pseudamabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
