    "intro": "Polygala dichroma, commonly known as the scarlet milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala dichroma is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
