    "intro": "Poa koeleri, commonly known as Koeler\u2019s bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa koeleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to form lush, carpet-like lawns."
