    "intro": "Pinus cubensis subsp. maestraensis, commonly known as the Maestraense pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Cuba. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and conical shape, with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain seeds surrounded by a woody covering. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
