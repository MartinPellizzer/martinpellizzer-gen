    "intro": "Pelargonium woodii, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant lacks traditional leaves, instead featuring small, scale-like structures at the base of its stems. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts and botanists."
