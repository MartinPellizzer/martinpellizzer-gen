    "intro": "Primula urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, serrated leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact, similar to stinging nettle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
