It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are aromatic, with a distinctive camphor-like scent, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Ptarmica borysthenica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
