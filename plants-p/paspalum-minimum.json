    "intro": "Paspalum minimum, commonly known as dwarf paspalum, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. This plant is well adapted to dry and sandy soils, making it a common species in arid and semi-arid regions. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its dense root system and drought tolerance. The plant's compact growth habit makes it ideal for ground cover in ornamental gardens."
