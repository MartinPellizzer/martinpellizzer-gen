    "intro": "Pterygiosperma, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its striking, yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving the plant a feathery appearance. Pterygiosperma species are native to various parts of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
