    "intro": "Pharnaceum verrucosum, commonly known as the\u75a3\u72b6\u8568, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, wart-like protrusions on its leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a complex rhizome system that aids in nutrient absorption and anchoring in its habitat. Its fronds are usually lanceolate, with a soft, velvety texture that distinguishes it from other fern species. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, humid ecosystems."
