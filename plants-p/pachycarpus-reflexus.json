    "intro": "Pachycarpus reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed thickshank, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its thick, fleshy stems, which help it store water in its arid native habitat. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many leguminous plants. Pachycarpus reflexus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry conditions."
