    "intro": "Platanthera chlorantha var. robusta, commonly known as the robust marsh orchid, is a striking orchid species native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a consistent supply of moisture. Its leaves are typically linear and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed wetland habitats."
