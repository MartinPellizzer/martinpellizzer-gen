    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa var. eriophora, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. Its leaves are small, rounded, and covered in fine, white hairs, which contribute to its drought-resistant nature. It is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
