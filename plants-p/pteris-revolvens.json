    "intro": "Pteris revolvens, commonly known as the scaly water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pale, scaly tissue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, finger-like segments that curl inward, giving the plant its distinctive appearance."
