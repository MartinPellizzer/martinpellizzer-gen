    "intro": "Peucedanum stridii, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
