    "intro": "Polycarena exigua, commonly known as the small water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and it produces tiny, dark brown seeds. Polycarena exigua plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
