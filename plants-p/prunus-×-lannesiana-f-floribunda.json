    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. floribunda, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms, which consist of numerous small petals arranged in a compact cluster, giving it a full, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with slender branches and a rounded habit. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. This cultivar is prized for its showy flowers, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully develop, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
