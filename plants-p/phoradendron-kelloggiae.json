    "intro": "Phoradendron kelloggiae, commonly known as the Kellogg's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale green berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the bark of suitable host trees. This species is an important part of the ecological dynamics in its native habitat."
