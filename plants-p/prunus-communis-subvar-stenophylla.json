    "intro": "Prunus communis subvar. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive spring blossoms and autumn foliage. The species is also valued in ecological landscaping for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
