    "intro": "Plagiogyria \u00d7 sessilifolia, commonly known as the hybrid spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often reddish stems and leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
