    "intro": "Prunus cartilaginea, commonly known as the Himalayan cherry or rock cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth margin, turning yellow in autumn. Prunus cartilaginea is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes."
