    "intro": "Polygonum antihaemorrhoidale f. aquatile, commonly known as the aquatic knotweed, is a variant of the genus Polygonum characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. It typically features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to water environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent species in wetland habitats. It is often found in slow-moving water bodies, such as ponds and marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
