    "intro": "Polypodium panorense, commonly known as the Panor\u00e9 fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
