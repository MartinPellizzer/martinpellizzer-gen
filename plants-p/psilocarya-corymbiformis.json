It is characterized by its dense, corymbiform (umbrella-like) cluster of small, white to pale yellow mushrooms. The fruiting bodies typically appear in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The cap is usually small and rounded, while the stem is short and sturdy. This species contains psychoactive compounds such as psilocybin and psilocin, making it a subject of both scientific and cultural interest."
