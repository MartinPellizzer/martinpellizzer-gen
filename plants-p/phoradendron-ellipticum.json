    "intro": "Phoradendron ellipticum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or green berries that are often used in holiday traditions. Its sticky seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the berries and excrete the seeds onto other host plants. Phoradendron ellipticum is native to various regions in the Americas and is known for its evergreen foliage and unique parasitic growth habit."
