    "intro": "Psilotum nudum var. molesworthiae, commonly known as the Molesworth's spike moss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves and clusters of sporangia at the tips of its branches. This plant is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Its structure is primitive, lacking true roots, stems, and leaves, and it exhibits a unique form of spore reproduction. The plant plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
