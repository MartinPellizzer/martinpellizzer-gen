    "intro": "Parastrephia, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often intricate flower structures that resemble spiders, hence their common name. Parastrephia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained environments. They have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as flies and wasps."
