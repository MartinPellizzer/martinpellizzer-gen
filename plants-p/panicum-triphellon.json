    "intro": "Panicum triphellon, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spreading rhizomes that form thick mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with reddish bracts, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental use. Its drought tolerance and ability to form a dense ground cover make it a valuable plant in native landscapes."
