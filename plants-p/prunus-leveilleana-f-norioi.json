    "intro": "Prunus leveilleana f. norioi, commonly known as the Norioi cherry, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, adding to its visual appeal. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
