It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic relationship with host plants. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with a spurred structure that aids in pollination by insects. The leaves are often small and opposite, adapted to the harsh conditions of its high-altitude habitat."
