    "intro": "Polypodium membranifolium, commonly known as the membranous-leaf polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a distinct membranous texture, contributing to its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
