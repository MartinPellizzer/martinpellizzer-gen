    "intro": "Phleum phleoides subsp. montanum, commonly known as mountain fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils, preferring cool and moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh climates and can thrive in areas with poor soil conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
