    "intro": "Phelipanche chionistrae, commonly known as the winter morning glory, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It is known for its parasitic nature, attaching itself to the roots of host plants to absorb nutrients. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
