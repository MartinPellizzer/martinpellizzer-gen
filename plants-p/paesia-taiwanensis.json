    "intro": "Paesia taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan paesia, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along forest floors or in mountainous regions. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, and it is often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
