It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a compact panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. Pseudobromus silvaticus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
