    "intro": "Polythecium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped fronds, which are typically broad and leathery. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
