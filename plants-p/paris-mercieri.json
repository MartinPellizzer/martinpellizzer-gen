It features dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
