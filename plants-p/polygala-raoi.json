    "intro": "Polygala raoi, commonly known as the Rao's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Polygala raoi is considered a rare and endangered species."
