    "intro": "Populus adenopoda var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf poplar, is a variant of the poplar genus native to China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as riverbanks and floodplains. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, which are typical of the Populus genus. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation."
