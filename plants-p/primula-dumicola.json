    "intro": "Primula dumicola, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Primula dumicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
