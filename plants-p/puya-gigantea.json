    "intro": "Puya gigantea, commonly known as the giant puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. Puya gigantea thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
