    "intro": "Phyllagathis penrissenensis, commonly known as the Penrissen stonecrop, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting to its arid and rocky habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
