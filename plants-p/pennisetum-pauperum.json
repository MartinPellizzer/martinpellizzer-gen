It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Pennisetum pauperum is often used as a ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery appearance. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
