    "intro": "Picea vulgaris var. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited spruce, is a rare variant of the white spruce. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange-red cones, which contrast with the typical green cones of the species. This variety is native to specific regions in North America, particularly in the western United States. The tree has a conical shape with dense, dark green needles and produces small, aromatic cones. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
