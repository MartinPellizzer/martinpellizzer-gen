    "intro": "Polygonum persicaria var. elatum, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a striking addition to wetland or marsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and they often have a reddish tint on the underside. This variant is closely related to the common knotweed but is distinguished by its greater size and more robust growth habit."
