    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 euramericana, commonly known as the black poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white poplar (Populus alba) and the cottonwood (Populus deltoides). It is a fast-growing tree characterized by its dark bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, facilitating its spread. The tree is often found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in floodplains."
