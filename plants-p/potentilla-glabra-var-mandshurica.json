It features wiry, branched stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
