    "intro": "Pogonatherum villosum, commonly known as hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers. Pogonatherum villosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
