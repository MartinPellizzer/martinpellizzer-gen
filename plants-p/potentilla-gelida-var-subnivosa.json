    "intro": "Potentilla gelida var. subnivosa, commonly known as the snowberry potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Arctic and alpine zones. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that remain close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are adapted to attract pollinators in cold environments. Its foliage and stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against extreme cold. This species is well-suited to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems."
