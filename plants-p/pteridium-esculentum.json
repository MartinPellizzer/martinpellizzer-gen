    "intro": "Pteridium esculentum, commonly known as the edible fern or bread fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its large, broad fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are edible and have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for food. The plant's ability to spread through rhizome fragmentation makes it an aggressive colonizer in its native habitats."
