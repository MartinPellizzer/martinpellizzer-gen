    "intro": "Protium chagrense, commonly known as Chagren tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a keystone species in tropical ecosystems, supporting diverse flora and fauna. The wood of Protium chagrense is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
