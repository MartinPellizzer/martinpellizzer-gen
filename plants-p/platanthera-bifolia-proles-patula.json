    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia proles patula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and reduced, often appearing as small, scale-like structures. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships."
