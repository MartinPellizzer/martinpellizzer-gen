    "intro": "Polypodium newtonii, commonly known as Newton's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
