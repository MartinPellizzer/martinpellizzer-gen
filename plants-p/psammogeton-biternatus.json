    "intro": "Psammogeton biternatus, commonly known as the three-leaved sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, giving it its common name. Psammogeton biternatus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
