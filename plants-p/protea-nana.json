    "intro": "Protea nana, commonly known as the dwarf protea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, bushy form. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Protea nana is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
