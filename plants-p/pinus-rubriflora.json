    "intro": "Pinus rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces long, slender cones that are typically 8 to 15 centimeters in length, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. Its needles are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, arranged in bundles of five, and are dark green with a slight blue tinge. The plant is well adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil."
