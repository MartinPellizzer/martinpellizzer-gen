    "intro": "Pilosocereus carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, shrub-like cactus with spiny stems and produces clusters of small, white to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
