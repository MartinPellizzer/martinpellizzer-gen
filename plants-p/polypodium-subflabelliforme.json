    "intro": "Polypodium subflabelliforme, commonly known as the flabelliform cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in crevices. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
