    "intro": "Polypodium concinnum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has a distinctive, compact frond with a serrated margin and a dense, creeping rhizome system. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium concinnum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
