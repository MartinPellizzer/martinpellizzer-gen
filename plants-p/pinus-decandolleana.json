    "intro": "Pinus decandolleana, commonly known as the Decandolle pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five, a feature common among many pine species. Its cones are woody and can remain on the tree for several years before opening to release seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and parks."
