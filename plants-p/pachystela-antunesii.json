    "intro": "Pachystela antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on host trees for nutrients. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, glossy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
