    "intro": "Polylobium oxypterum, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats. The plant has a low-growing habit with clustered, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a silvery or woolly coating. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in early summer and are clustered in dense inflorescences. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
