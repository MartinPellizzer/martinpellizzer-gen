    "intro": "Plexipus insularis var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular plexipus, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves. It is native to a limited geographic region, typically found in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, with foliage that is dense and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
