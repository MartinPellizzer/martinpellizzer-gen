    "intro": "Philodendron cyclops, commonly known as the miniature philodendron, is a climbing tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Philodendron cyclops thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
