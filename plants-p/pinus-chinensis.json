    "intro": "Pinus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese red pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree produces male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed capsules that release seeds in the fall. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress. Pinus chinensis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form and resilience to urban conditions."
