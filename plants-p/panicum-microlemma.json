    "intro": "Panicum microlemma, commonly known as little barley or dwarf barnyard grass, is a grass species native to Africa and widely naturalized in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing annual plant with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are minute and dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural and disturbed areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its reduced lemma structure, which gives it the specific epithet \"microlemma.\""
