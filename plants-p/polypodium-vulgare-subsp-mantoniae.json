    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare subsp. mantoniae, commonly known as the Mantonia fern, is a fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a dense network of roots that help anchor it in soil. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds."
