    "intro": "Polyspora singaporeana, commonly known as the Singapore polyspora, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Singapore. It belongs to the family Polysporaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
