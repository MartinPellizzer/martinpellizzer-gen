    "intro": "Pinus regeliana, commonly known as the Regel's pine, is a species of conifer native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and small, cone-like structures that mature to release seeds. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its cones are often reddish-brown and remain closed for several years before opening to disperse seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
