    "intro": "Panax armatus, commonly known as the armated ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, fleshy, and branched root system that resembles a human arm, hence its common name. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer. Its roots contain bioactive compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
