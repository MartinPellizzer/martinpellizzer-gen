It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, sessile leaves that are clustered at the base, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
