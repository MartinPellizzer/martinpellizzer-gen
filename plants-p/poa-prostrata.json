    "intro": "Poa prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often carpeting the ground in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems that lie close to the soil surface, with small, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in clusters, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa prostrata is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and erosion control."
