    "intro": "Psoralea hallii var. media, commonly known as the narrow-leaf psoralea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are typical of the genus Psoralea. It has adapted to thrive in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation to harsh environments."
