It is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or brown when mature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge. Pyrus globosa is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
