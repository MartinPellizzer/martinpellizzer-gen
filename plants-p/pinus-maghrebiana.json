    "intro": "Pinus maghrebiana, commonly known as the Moroccan pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in pairs. The cones of this plant are typically woody and contain two to three seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests. The tree is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
