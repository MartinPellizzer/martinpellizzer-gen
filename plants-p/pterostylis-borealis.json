    "intro": "Pterostylis borealis, commonly known as the northern duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as under forest canopies or in rocky areas. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single or few flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. Its flowers have a unique structure with a labellum that resembles a duck's bill, giving it its common name. Pterostylis borealis is pollinated by specific insects, primarily thynnid wasps, which are attracted to its scent and floral morphology."
