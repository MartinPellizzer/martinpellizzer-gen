    "intro": "Praealstonia mucronata, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features simple, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in subtropical regions."
