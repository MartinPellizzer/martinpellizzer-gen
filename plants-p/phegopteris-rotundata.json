    "intro": "Phegopteris rotundata, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, round, and often clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The rock polypody is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in containers or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
