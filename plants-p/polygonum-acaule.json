    "intro": "Polygonum acaule, commonly known as the stemless knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its absence of a distinct stem, with leaves arising directly from the root system. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in moist, disturbed soils. Polygonum acaule is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments."
