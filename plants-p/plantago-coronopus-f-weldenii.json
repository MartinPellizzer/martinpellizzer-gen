    "intro": "Plantago coronopus f. weldenii, commonly known as the Welden's plantain, is a rare botanical variant of the common plantain. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. It has a compact growth habit and is often overlooked due to its subtle appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
