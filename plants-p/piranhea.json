    "intro": "Piranhea, commonly known as the water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is native to freshwater habitats in warm regions around the world. The plant's roots are submerged, while its stems and leaves are adapted for life in water, with a waxy coating to prevent water loss. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Piranhea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
