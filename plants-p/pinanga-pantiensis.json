    "intro": "Pinanga pantiensis, commonly known as the Bornean bamboo palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and clustered, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue-black fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to habitat loss, Pinanga pantiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
