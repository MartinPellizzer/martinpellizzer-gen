    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiperoides var. asperifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved smartweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch due to their hairy surfaces. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. This species is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to environments with fluctuating water levels."
