    "intro": "Pteris inermis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. Pteris inermis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and air-purifying properties."
