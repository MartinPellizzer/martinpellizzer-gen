    "intro": "Prenanthes formosana, commonly known as the Formosan water shield, is a member of the Araceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Prenanthes formosana is native to East Asia, particularly Taiwan, and is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
