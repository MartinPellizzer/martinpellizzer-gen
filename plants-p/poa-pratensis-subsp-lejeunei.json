    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. lejeunei, commonly known as the meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, often forming a lush, green carpet in grasslands and meadows. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in damp areas such as stream banks and marshy meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of many temperate grassland ecosystems."
