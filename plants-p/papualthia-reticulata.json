    "intro": "Papualthia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. The plant features rhizomatous growth, with slender, branching stems that produce compound leaves. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in pollination. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
