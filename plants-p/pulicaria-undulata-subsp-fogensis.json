    "intro": "Pulicaria undulata subsp. fogensis, commonly known as the Foggy Heath, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and alpine meadows. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
