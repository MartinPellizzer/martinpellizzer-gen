    "intro": "Pelea olowaluensis, commonly known as the Olowalu pelea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws. Its unique ecological role makes it an important species for the region's biodiversity."
