    "intro": "Petrodora fruticulosa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Its stems are often woody and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Petrodora fruticulosa plays a role in stabilizing soils in rocky and disturbed habitats."
