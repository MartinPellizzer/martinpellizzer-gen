    "intro": "Polypodium pedicularifolium, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species."
