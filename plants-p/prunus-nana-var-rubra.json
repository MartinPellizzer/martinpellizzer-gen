    "intro": "Prunus nana var. rubra, commonly known as the red dwarf cherry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is valued in both horticultural and ecological settings."
