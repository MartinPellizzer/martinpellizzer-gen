    "intro": "Papaver \u00d7 exspectatum, commonly known as the hybrid poppy, is a cross between Papaver rhoeas (common poppy) and Papaver orientale (oriental poppy). It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its striking, large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The seeds are produced in a fluffy, seed-bearing capsule that disperses easily by wind."
