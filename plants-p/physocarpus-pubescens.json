    "intro": "Physocarpus pubescens, commonly known as the silky ninebark, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, followed by velvety, red or purplish berries. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Physocarpus pubescens is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for birds and insects."
