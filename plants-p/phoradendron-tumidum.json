    "intro": "Phoradendron tumidum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host. Phoradendron tumidum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and influencing the health of its host trees."
