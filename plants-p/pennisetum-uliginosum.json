    "intro": "Pennisetum uliginosum, commonly known as purple muhly, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It features slender, upright stems that often turn a striking purple hue as they mature. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Pennisetum uliginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
