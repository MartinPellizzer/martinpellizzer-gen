It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
