    "intro": "Pitcairnia bergii, commonly known as the Berg's pineapple plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial bromeliad that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, fibrous covering called a trichome layer. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange. Pitcairnia bergii is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine in its native habitat."
