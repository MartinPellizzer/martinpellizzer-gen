    "intro": "Phyllanthus finlaysonianus, commonly known as the Hawaiian goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by three-lobed fruits. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing in sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
