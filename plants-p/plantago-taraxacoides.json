It features a rosette of broad, ribbed leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a dense cluster, which are followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves have been used historically for their medicinal properties, including treating wounds and digestive issues."
