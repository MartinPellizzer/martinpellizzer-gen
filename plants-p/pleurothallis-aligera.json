    "intro": "Pleurothallis aligera, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery or pale green waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale pink, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists."
