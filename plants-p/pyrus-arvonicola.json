    "intro": "Pyrus arvonicola, commonly known as the alpine pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. This shrub or small tree typically grows at high altitudes, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife."
