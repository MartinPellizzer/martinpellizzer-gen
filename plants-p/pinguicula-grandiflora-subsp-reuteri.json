    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora subsp. reuteri, commonly known as the giant butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sticky leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous small, white flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs or wet meadows. Its botanical features make it a unique and fascinating subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
