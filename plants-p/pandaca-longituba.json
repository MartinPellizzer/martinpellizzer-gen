    "intro": "Pandaca longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed pandaca, is a unique member of the Pandaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a mild, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
