    "intro": "Phelypaea ramosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a compact shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its low-growing form and cold tolerance, it is an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
