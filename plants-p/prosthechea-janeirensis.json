    "intro": "Prosthechea janeirensis, commonly known as the Janeirensis orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that are typically yellow or orange in hue. It has a short, erect stem with a rosette of fleshy, overlapping leaves that help store water. Prosthechea janeirensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
