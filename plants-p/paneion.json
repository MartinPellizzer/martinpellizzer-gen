    "intro": "Paneion, commonly known as the Mediterranean stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the summer months. Paneion is often found growing on rocky soils and slopes, where it forms dense mats. Its botanical name, Paneion, is derived from the Greek word for \"stone,\" reflecting its preference for rocky habitats."
