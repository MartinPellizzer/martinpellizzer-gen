    "intro": "Podocarpus linearis, commonly known as the linear podocarp or narrow-leaf podocarp, is a species of evergreen coniferous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of conifers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Podocarpus linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture and reforestation projects."
