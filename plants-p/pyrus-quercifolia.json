    "intro": "Pyrus quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits resembling pears. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Pyrus quercifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its fruit in some regions."
