    "intro": "Paepalanthus savannarum, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats like grasslands and savannas. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native environment."
