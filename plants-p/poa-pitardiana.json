It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa pitardiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
