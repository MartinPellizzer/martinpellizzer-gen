    "intro": "Piper submultiplinerve, commonly known as the multi-veined pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves with multiple veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are berry-like and contain a single seed, which is used in traditional medicine. The plant's complex venation pattern makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
