    "intro": "Parinari capensis subsp. capensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and has smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
