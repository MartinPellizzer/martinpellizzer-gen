    "intro": "Polygala boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian milkweed, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Bolivia and neighboring regions. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers that resemble those of milkweeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and branched. The flowering period occurs during the dry season, and the plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
