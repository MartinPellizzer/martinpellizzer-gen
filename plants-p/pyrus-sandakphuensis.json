    "intro": "Pyrus sandakphuensis, commonly known as the Sandakphu pear, is a rare species native to the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, with heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are highly valued in local communities. It thrives in moist, temperate climates at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
