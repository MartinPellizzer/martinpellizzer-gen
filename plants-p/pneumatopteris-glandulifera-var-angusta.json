    "intro": "Pneumatopteris glandulifera var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pneumatopteris. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant possesses specialized structures called stolons, which help in spreading and anchoring the plant in water. Its fronds are usually finely divided, contributing to its delicate appearance. This variety is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
