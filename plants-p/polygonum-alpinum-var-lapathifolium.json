    "intro": "Polygonum alpinum var. lapathifolium, commonly known as alpine knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early autumn. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more lobed leaves compared to the typical form of Polygonum alpinum."
