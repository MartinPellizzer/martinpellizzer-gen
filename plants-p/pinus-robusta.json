    "intro": "Pinus robusta, commonly known as the robust pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cone-like structures called cones, which contain the seeds necessary for reproduction. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and pests. Pinus robusta is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments."
