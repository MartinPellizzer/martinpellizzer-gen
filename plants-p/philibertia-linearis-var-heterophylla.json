    "intro": "Philibertia linearis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf filbert, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowering stems are often shorter than the leaves, and the leaves are usually arranged in a basal rosette. This variant is distinguished by its variation in leaf shape compared to the typical form of Philibertia linearis."
