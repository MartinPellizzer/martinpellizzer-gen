    "intro": "Parishia rosea, commonly known as the pink stinkhorn, is a unique fungal plant that belongs to the Phallaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive pink, fleshy sporophore that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract flies for spore dispersal. The fungus grows on decaying wood, typically in moist, shaded environments. Its structure consists of a short, club-shaped stem and a bulbous, spore-producing body. Parishia rosea plays an important ecological role in decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems."
