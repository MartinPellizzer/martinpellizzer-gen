    "intro": "Paramignya armata var. andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman mountain fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andaman Islands. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It is often found growing in dense undergrowth along forest edges and in disturbed soils. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
