    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum subsp. depressum, commonly known as the dwarf four-angled evening-primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, hairy stems that typically lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in the evening, giving it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
