    "intro": "Paspalum bonairense, commonly known as the Bahamian grass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air. Paspalum bonairense is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
