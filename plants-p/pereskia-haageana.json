    "intro": "Pereskia haageana, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often mistaken for leaves, which are actually modified stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or red in color. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Pereskia haageana is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils."
