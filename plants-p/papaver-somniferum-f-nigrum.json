    "intro": "Papaver somniferum f. nigrum, commonly known as blackberry poppy, is a botanical variant of the opium poppy. It is characterized by its dark purple to black petals and a distinctive, compact flower structure. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and has a short growing season. Its flowers are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance. However, it is important to note that this species is closely related to plants from which opium is derived."
