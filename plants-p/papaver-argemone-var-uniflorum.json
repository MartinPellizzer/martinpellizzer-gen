    "intro": "Papaver argemone var. uniflorum, commonly known as the Mexican poppy, is a variant of the Argemone poppy native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers and smooth, waxy leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Its botanical features make it both a notable ornamental plant and a species of ecological interest."
