    "intro": "Piper cernuum f. papillatum, commonly known as the hairy siphonoglossum, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by small, round berries. Its foliage and stems are commonly used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The varietal form 'papillatum' is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy texture compared to the typical form of *Piper cernuum*."
