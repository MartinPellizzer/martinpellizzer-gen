    "intro": "Polystichum discolor, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are adorned with silvery-white to pale blue markings, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides of the pinnae."
