    "intro": "Paronychia maritima, commonly known as salt marsh grass or sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, where it thrives in the intertidal zone. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paronychia maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
