It is characterized by its drooping clusters of bright orange-red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in the rainy season. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. Its bark is smooth and greyish, with a faintly aromatic scent. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 20 meters tall in its natural habitat."
