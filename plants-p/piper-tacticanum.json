    "intro": "Piper tacticanum, commonly known as the creeping pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, heart-shaped leaves, and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. It produces small berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to cascade from hanging baskets or trellises."
