    "intro": "Pseudo-fumaria schanginii, commonly known as the Schangin's false glory-of-the-snow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae, which includes several species known for their delicate, showy flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, often resembling those of true fumaria species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
