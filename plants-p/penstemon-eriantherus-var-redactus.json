The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through summer."
