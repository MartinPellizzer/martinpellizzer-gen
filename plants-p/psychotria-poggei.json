    "intro": "Psychotria poggei, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of Colombia and is typically found in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
