    "intro": "Pollia secundiflora var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant flame plant, is a striking member of the Aroid family, native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, vibrant orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by these showy bracts, a common feature in the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant's unique appearance and growth habits make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and botanical collections."
