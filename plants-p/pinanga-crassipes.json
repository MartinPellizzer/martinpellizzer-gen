    "intro": "Pinanga crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. The plant is often cultivated for its edible tubers, which are similar in texture to yams and arrowroot."
