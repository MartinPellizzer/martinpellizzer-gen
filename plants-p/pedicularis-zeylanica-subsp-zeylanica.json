    "intro": "Pedicularis zeylanica subsp. zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
