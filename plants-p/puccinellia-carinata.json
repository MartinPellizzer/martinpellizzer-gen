    "intro": "Puccinellia carinata, commonly known as spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and is adapted to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. It is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Puccinellia carinata plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
