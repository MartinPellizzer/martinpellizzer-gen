    "intro": "Pelae, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Pelae thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
