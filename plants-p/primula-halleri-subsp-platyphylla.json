    "intro": "Primula halleri subsp. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad and ovate, with a hairy surface, and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. It has a short growing season and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, making it a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators."
