    "intro": "Pediocactus bradyi subsp. bradyi, commonly known as the Brady's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem, which is typically covered in spines and covered with a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
