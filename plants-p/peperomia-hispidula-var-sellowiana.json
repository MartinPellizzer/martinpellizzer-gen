    "intro": "Peperomia hispidula var. sellowiana, commonly known as the Sellow's peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and ornamental foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
