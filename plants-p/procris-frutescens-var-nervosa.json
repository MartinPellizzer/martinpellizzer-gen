    "intro": "Procris frutescens var. nervosa, commonly known as the slender procris, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves with prominent venation, which gives it the variety name *nervosa*. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
