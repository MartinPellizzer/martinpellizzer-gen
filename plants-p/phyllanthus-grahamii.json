    "intro": "Phyllanthus grahamii, commonly known as Graham's spurge, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with a compact and bushy appearance. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
