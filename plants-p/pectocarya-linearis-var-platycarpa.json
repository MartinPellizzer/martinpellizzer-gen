    "intro": "Pectocarya linearis var. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited desert brome, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in narrow, cylindrical capsules, which release tiny seeds when mature. This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
