    "intro": "Psychanthus schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's psychanthus, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and clove, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high biodiversity. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
