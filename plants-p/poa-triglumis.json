    "intro": "Poa triglumis, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelets that bear three awns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Poa triglumis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
