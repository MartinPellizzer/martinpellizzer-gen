    "intro": "Paspalum horticola var. maritimum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes. Its low maintenance requirements make it a valuable plant for erosion control in maritime environments."
