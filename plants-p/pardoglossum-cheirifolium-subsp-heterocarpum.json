    "intro": "Pardoglossum cheirifolium subsp. heterocarpum, commonly known as the Moroccan leafy orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with broad, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
