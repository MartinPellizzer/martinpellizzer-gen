    "intro": "Pinus umbilicata, commonly known as the umbrella pine, is a unique conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like shape formed by its dense, spreading branches. The tree has short, twisted needles that are typically blue-green in color. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for years. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils."
