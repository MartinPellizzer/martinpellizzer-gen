    "intro": "Pleurostachys douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of fine, silver-green foliage and delicate, feathery flower spikes that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It is valued in landscaping for its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
