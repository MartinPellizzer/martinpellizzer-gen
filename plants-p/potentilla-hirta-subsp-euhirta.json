    "intro": "Potentilla hirta subsp. euhirta, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine, white hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and long-lasting blooms."
