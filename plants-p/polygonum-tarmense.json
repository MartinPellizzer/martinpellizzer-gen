    "intro": "Polygonum tarmense, commonly known as Tarmian knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Polygonum tarmense is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
