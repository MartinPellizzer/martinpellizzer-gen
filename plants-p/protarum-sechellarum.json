It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers with white petals and yellow stamens. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the forest understory. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
