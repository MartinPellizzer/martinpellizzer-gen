    "intro": "Petastoma obliquum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the grasslands of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats and is well adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, tufted growth habit. Petastoma obliquum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
