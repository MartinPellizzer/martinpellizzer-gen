    "intro": "Pisonia rusbyana, commonly known as the Rusby's pisonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its showy, pendulous clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
