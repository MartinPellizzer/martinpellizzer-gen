    "intro": "Parodia gladiata, commonly known as the sword cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that resemble swords, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance. Parodia gladiata thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates."
