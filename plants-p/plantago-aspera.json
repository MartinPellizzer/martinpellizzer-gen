    "intro": "Plantago aspera, commonly known as rough plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, oval-shaped leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Plantago aspera is known for its medicinal properties, with the leaves used traditionally to treat wounds and inflammatory conditions."
