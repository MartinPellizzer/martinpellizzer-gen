    "intro": "Potentilla sylvestris subvar. turfosa, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its compact form and hardiness make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
