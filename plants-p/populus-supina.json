    "intro": "Populus supina, commonly known as the prostrate poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit, with multiple stems arising from the base. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin, with a broad ovate or lanceolate shape. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
