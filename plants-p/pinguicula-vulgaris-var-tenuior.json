    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender bladdernut, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in mucilage to trap insects. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its botanical structure is adapted for both photosynthesis and insect capture, making it a unique example of plant carnivory."
