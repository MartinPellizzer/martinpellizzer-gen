    "intro": "Pterostylis aphylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces a single, pale green or white flower with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
