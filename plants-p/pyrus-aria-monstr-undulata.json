    "intro": "Pyrus aria monstr. undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaved pear, is a unique variant of the pear genus characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf margins. This plant exhibits a deciduous habit, with leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit, though less commonly cultivated, can be small and tart, with a skin that is thin and delicate. Botanically, it is classified within the Rosaceae family, sharing traits with other pear species but distinguished by its unusual foliage."
