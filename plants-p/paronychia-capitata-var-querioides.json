    "intro": "Paronychia capitata var. querioides, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
