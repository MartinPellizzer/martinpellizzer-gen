    "intro": "Pteris dataensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. Pteris dataensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
