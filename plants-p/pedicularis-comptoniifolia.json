    "intro": "Pedicularis comptoniifolia, commonly known as the Compton's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with spurred petals that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
