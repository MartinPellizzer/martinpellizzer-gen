    "intro": "Phacelia pinnatifida, commonly known as slender phacelia, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Phacelia pinnatifida is valued for its nectar-rich flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
