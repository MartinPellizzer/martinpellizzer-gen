    "intro": "Panicum procerrimum, commonly known as the long-bract panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species for livestock."
