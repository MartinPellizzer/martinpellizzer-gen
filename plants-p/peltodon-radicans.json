    "intro": "Peltodon radicans, commonly known as the creeping pellitory, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a spreading rhizomatous root system that allows it to colonize areas effectively. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white, powdery coating, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in the summer months."
