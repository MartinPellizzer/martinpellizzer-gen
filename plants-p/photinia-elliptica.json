    "intro": "Photinia elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical photinia, is a flowering shrub native to eastern Australia. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in autumn. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Photinia elliptica is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for landscaping in temperate climates."
