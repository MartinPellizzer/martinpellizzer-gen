    "intro": "Polycodium arenicola, commonly known as the sand polycodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion."
