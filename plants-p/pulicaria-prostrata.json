    "intro": "Pulicaria prostrata, commonly known as creeping tansy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Pulicaria prostrata is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
