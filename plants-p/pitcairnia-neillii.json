    "intro": "Pitcairnia neillii, commonly known as the Neill's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss and provide some protection against herbivores. Pitcairnia neillii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
