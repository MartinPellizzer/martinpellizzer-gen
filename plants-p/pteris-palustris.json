    "intro": "Pteris palustris, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a species of fern native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It has feather-like fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and wet meadows. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
