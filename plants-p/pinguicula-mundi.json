    "intro": "Pinguicula mundi, commonly known as the African butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a feature typical of the genus Pinguicula. The plant produces delicate white or pink flowers during the growing season, which are often clustered in a raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its unique morphology and carnivorous nature make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
