    "intro": "Pinalia kitangladensis, commonly known as the Kitanglad pine, is a rare coniferous tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in high-altitude montane forests, where it adapts to cool and moist conditions. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Pinalia kitangladensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
