    "intro": "Pteroceras mentakabense, commonly known as the Mentakab hill orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Peninsular Malaysia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter in primary rainforests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pteroceras mentakabense is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
