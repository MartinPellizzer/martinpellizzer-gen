    "intro": "Periclymenum vulgare var. quercifolium, commonly known as the bearberry, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in woodland and open areas. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are broad and resemble those of the oak tree, giving it its scientific name. The bearberry is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
