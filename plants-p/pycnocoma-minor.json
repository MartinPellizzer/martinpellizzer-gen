    "intro": "Pycnocoma minor, commonly known as the dwarf pycnocoma, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
