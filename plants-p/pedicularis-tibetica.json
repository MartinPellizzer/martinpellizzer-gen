    "intro": "Pedicularis tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant typically features showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on host plants for nutrients. Pedicularis tibetica is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
