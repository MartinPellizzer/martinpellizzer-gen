    "intro": "Polypodium spectrum, commonly known as the silver sword fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. Polypodium spectrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, shaded garden setting."
