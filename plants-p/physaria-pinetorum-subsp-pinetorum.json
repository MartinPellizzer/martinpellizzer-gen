    "intro": "Physaria pinetorum subsp. pinetorum, commonly known as the Sierra Blanca bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as desert scrub and limestone hills, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are alternate and lobed, while its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
