    "intro": "Pyrus eleonorae, commonly known as the Eleanor pear, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears but are less widely cultivated today. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus eleonorae is considered a species of conservation concern."
