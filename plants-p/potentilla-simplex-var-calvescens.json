    "intro": "Potentilla simplex var. calvescens, commonly known as the Alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with cold climates."
