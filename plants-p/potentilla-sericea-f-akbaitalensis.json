    "intro": "Potentilla sericea f. akbaitalensis, commonly known as the AKBaitalensis cineraria, is a rare and unique botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-green foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with low temperatures and intense sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
