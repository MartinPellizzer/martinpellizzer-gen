    "intro": "Pulicaria burchardii, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense, silver-green foliage with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and desert scrub habitats. Pulicaria burchardii is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
