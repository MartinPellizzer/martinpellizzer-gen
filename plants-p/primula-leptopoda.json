    "intro": "Primula leptopoda, commonly known as the slender primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
