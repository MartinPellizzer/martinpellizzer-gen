    "intro": "Polythecium citrinum, commonly known as the yellow cup fungus, is a species of ascomycete fungus characterized by its distinctive yellow, cup-shaped fruiting body. It typically grows on decaying wood in forested areas, thriving in humid and temperate climates. The fungus has a simple, smooth cap that is often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its spore-producing structures, called ascocarps, are embedded within the cup-like structure. This species plays an important role in the decomposition of organic matter in its ecosystem."
