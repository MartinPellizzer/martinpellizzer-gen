    "intro": "Portulaca immersostellulata, commonly known as the star-stemmed purslane, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has small, paddle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Portulaca immersostellulata is well adapted to thrive in poor soils and can be found in rocky areas, sandy soils, and along disturbed ground."
