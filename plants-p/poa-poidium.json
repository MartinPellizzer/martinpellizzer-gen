    "intro": "Poa poidium, commonly known as the meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, lawns, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. Poa poidium plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
