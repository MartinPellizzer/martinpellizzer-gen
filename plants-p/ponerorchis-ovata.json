    "intro": "Ponerorchis ovata, commonly known as the ovate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
