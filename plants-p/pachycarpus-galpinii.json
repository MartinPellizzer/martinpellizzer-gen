    "intro": "Pachycarpus galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's thickbark, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark that provides protection against fire and drought. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh environments."
