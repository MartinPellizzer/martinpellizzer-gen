    "intro": "Paullinia fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Paullinia fluminensis thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. It has also been introduced to other tropical regions, where it sometimes becomes an invasive species."
