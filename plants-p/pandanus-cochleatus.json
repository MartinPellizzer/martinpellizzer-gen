    "intro": "Pandanus cochleatus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to thrive in coastal and saline environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves. The fruit, which is a fibrous structure containing a single seed, is often used in traditional crafts and for its fibrous material."
