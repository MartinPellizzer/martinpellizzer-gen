    "intro": "Pandanus ornatus f. spicatus, commonly known as the spicate pandanus, is a variant of the pandanus plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. These flowers are followed by small, triangular fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. The plant is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a resilient and ornamental species in tropical landscapes."
