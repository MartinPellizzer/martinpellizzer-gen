    "intro": "Piriqueta abairana, commonly known as the Brazilian sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and large, showy yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the sunflower. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Piriqueta abairana is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open habitats across its native range."
