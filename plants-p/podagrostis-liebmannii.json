    "intro": "Podagrostis liebmannii, commonly known as the Liebmann's grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Podagrostis liebmannii plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
