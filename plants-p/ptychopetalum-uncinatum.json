    "intro": "Ptychopetalum uncinatum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
