    "intro": "Pimenta moaensis, commonly known as the Moa Island pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the island of Moa in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, where it thrives in coastal and dry forest habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds. Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, Pimenta moaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
