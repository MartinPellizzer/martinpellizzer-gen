    "intro": "Panicum lanatum var. sorghoideum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, appressed hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged in open panicles, with bracts that are often hairy and persistent. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. Silverleaf panicgrass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
