    "intro": "Phyteuma hispidum, commonly known as the rough phyteuma, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant has hairy foliage, which gives it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Phyteuma hispidum is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
