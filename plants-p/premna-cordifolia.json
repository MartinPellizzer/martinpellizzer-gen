    "intro": "Premna cordifolia, commonly known as Indian nettle or heartleaf premna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern temperate regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree with opposite, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are typically red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
