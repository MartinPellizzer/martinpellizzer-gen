    "intro": "Polystichum articulatipilosum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous indusium."
