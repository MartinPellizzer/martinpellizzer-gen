    "intro": "Psychotria pilosula, commonly known as the hairy psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with white or pale pink petals, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Psychotria pilosula is also known for its potential use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various animals."
