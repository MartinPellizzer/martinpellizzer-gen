    "intro": "Pericallis hadrosoma, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem arising from a rhizome and producing a cluster of leaves and flowers. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its humid, tropical environment. Pericallis hadrosoma is a popular ornamental plant due to its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
