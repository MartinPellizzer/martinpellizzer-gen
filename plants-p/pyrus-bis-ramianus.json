    "intro": "Pyrus bis-ramianus, commonly known as the two-branched pear, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pyrus. It is native to parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, where it typically grows in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its deciduous leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, a pear-like berry, is edible and has been used in traditional medicine. However, it is not widely cultivated today due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements."
