    "intro": "Platanus occidentalis var. densicoma, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches, revealing a mottled appearance. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge. It produces distinctive spherical, fuzzy fruit clusters that hang from the branches. This variety is well adapted to moist, fertile soils and is often found along riverbanks and in urban landscapes."
