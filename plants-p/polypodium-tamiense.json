    "intro": "Polypodium tamiense, commonly known as the Tamiense shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
