It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
