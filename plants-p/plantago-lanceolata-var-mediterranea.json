    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by elongated, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. This variety is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
