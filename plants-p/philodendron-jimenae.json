    "intro": "Philodendron jimenae, commonly known as the Jimenez philodendron, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
