    "intro": "Paspalum pauperculum, commonly known as the poor grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
