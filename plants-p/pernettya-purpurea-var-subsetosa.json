    "intro": "Pernettya purpurea var. subsetosa, commonly known as the purple pernettya, is a flowering shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple tinge. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black when mature, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. The leaves are typically elliptical and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
