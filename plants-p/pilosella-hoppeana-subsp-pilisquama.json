    "intro": "Pilosella hoppeana subsp. pilisquama, commonly known as the woolly pearlyweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-white woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
