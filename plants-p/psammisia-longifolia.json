    "intro": "Psammisia longifolia, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, windy conditions. Psammisia longifolia is a hardy perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in coastal and desert regions."
