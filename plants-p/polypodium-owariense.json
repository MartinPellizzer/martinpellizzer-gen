    "intro": "Polypodium owariense, commonly known as the Owari fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves that produce spores for reproduction."
