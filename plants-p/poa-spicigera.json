    "intro": "Poa spicigera, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. Poa spicigera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
