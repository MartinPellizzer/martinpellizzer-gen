    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus piauhyensis, commonly known as the Piauhy night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a climbing cactus with cylindrical stems that are often spiny and covered in areoles. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The cactus is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it well-suited to its native habitat."
