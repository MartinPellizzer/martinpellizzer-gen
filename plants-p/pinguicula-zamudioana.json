    "intro": "Pinguicula zamudioana, commonly known as the Zamudio's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects, providing it with essential nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
