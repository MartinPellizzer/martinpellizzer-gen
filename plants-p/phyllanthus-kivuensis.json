    "intro": "Phyllanthus kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu spurge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and East Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in umbels. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
