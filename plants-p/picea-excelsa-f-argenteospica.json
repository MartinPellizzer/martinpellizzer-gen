    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. argenteospica, commonly known as the silver-spined white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce tree native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on the leaves, which give it its unique appearance. The foliage is typically dense and conical, with a slow growth rate that allows it to thrive in harsh, cold climates. This form is adapted to high-altitude environments, where it can withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in horticulture and botanical gardens."
