    "intro": "Polygala comosa var. alibotuschiense, commonly known as the Alibotuschiense milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
