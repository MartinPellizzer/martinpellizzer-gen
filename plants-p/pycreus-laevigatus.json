It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth to the touch, as suggested by its specific epithet \"laevigatus.\" Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in clusters that bloom in the spring.
