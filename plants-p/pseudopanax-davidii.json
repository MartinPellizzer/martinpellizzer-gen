    "intro": "Pseudopanax davidii, commonly known as the silver pine, is a unique evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral arrangement of leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones, and the tree is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Pseudopanax davidii plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native forests."
