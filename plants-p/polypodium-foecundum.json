    "intro": "Polypodium foecundum, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its upright, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium foecundum is known for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
