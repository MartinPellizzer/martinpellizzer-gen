    "intro": "Pedicularis leveilleana, commonly known as the Alpine Monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its tubular, often brightly colored flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats."
