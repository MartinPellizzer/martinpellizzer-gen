    "intro": "Peperomia umbilicata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to tropical regions. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
