    "intro": "Phegopteris subobscura, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family. Phegopteris subobscura plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
