    "intro": "Payena eugeniifolia, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are usually alternate. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
