    "intro": "Parahancornia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, often featuring thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. Parahancornia species are well-suited to hot, dry climates and are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements. They also produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind or animals."
