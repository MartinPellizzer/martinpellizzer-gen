    "intro": "Pteris incisa f. rugosa, commonly known as the rugose water fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds. The fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a serrated or toothed margin that gives the plant its rugged appearance. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps them retain moisture in moist environments. It thrives in shady, damp areas and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
