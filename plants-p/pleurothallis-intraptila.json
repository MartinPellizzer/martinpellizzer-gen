    "intro": "Pleurothallis intraptila, commonly known as the \"saddle-back orchid,\" is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It is a small epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features intricate, delicate flowers with a distinctive saddle-shaped lip, which is a characteristic trait of many pleurothallis species. Its blossoms typically range in color from white to pale yellow, and they are often fragrant. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, Pleurothallis intraptila is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
