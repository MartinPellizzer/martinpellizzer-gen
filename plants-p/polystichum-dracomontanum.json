    "intro": "Polystichum dracomontanum, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil. The name \"dragon's blood\" is believed to reference the reddish color of its spores, which resemble dried blood."
