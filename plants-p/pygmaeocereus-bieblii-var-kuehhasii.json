    "intro": "Pygmaeocereus bieblii var. kuehhasii, commonly known as the Kuehne's night blooming cactus, is a rare and striking cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
