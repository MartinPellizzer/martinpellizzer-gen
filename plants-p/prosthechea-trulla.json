    "intro": "Prosthechea trulla, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, red-tipped flowers. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base and are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Prosthechea trulla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated for its vibrant color and unique appearance."
