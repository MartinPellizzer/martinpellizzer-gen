    "intro": "Pyrus angustifolia var. melanocarpa, commonly known as the blackcap pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves and small, dark purple to black fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its flowers are white and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is edible, though often used for ornamental purposes due to its striking color and hardiness."
