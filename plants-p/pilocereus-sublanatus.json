It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habits, it is a popular choice for collectors and desert gardeners."
