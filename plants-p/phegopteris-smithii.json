    "intro": "Phegopteris smithii, commonly known as the Smith's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, particularly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a long, narrow, and often curled shape, and its leaves are typically bright green. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The spores of Phegopteris smithii are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
