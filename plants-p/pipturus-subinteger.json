    "intro": "Pipturus subinteger, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for hedges and landscape plantings. Pipturus subinteger is relatively low maintenance and thrives in partial to full sunlight."
