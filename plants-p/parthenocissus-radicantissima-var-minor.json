    "intro": "Parthenocissus radicantissima var. minor, commonly known as the creeping woodbine, is a vigorous climbing vine native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically five-lobed, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the summer, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often considered astringent. Its strong tendrils allow it to climb and spread over walls, trellises, and other structures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide dense coverage in gardens."
