    "intro": "Pleurothallis alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with a subtle greenish tinge. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
