    "intro": "Pterocephalus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered pterocephalus, is a member of the Papaveraceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate and lanceolate, often with a hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in dry environments."
