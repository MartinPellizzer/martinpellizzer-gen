    "intro": "Pilea forgetii, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features round, fleshy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in spring, followed by pale green berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular houseplant. Pilea forgetii is valued for its ornamental foliage and ease of care, though it can become leggy if not pruned regularly."
