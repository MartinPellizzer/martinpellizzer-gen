    "intro": "Phyllanthus caroliniensis, commonly known as Carolina spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features succulent, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, greenish-brown fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both vegetative reproduction and seed dispersal."
