It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes make it a hardy species capable of spreading through vegetative propagation."
