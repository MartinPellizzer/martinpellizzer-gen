    "intro": "Phegopteris obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces floating fronds with broad, lobed leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality."
