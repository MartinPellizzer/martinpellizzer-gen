    "intro": "Pennisetum ramosissimum, commonly known as purple muhly, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its fountain-like growth habit and striking purple-pink flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is often used in ornamental gardening for its ornate appearance. Pennisetum ramosissimum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
