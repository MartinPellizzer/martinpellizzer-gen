    "intro": "Pelazoneuron abruptum, commonly known as the abrupt mountain fern, is a rare and unique species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, abruptly tapering fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, with spores released from specialized sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pelazoneuron abruptum is considered a vulnerable species."
