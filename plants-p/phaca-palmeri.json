It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as desert plains and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss, while its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a cluster. Phaca palmeri is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
