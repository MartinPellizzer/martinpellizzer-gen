It is characterized by its sparse, clustered foliage and stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with a rough, textured surface, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This plant is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
