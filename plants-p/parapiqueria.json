    "intro": "Parapiqueria, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, colorful flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and mountain streams. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Parapiqueria species are valued not only for their ornamental beauty but also for their cultural and medicinal significance in indigenous communities."
