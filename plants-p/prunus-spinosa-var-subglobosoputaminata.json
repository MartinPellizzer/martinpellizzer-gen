    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. subglobosoputaminata, commonly known as the globular thorned cherry, is a rare and unique variant of the common blackthorn. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant features thorny branches and small, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical interest lies in its unusual morphology and potential ornamental value."
