    "intro": "Pachystela cinerea var. cuneata, commonly known as the silverleaf lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-white coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with red-brown markings, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to South Africa, it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements in gardens."
