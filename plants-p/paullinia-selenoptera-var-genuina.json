    "intro": "Paullinia selenoptera var. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian soursop or Brazilian star apple, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes speckled underside. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that give way to yellow, fleshy fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its botanical features make it well-suited for humid, shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
