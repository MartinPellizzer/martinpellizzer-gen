It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a rigid, dark green appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
