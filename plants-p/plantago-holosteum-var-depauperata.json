    "intro": "Plantago holosteum var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its reduced foliage and slender growth habit. It is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
