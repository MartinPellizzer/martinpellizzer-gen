    "intro": "Pilosella hollolensis, commonly known as the Alpine pilosella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Pilosella hollolensis is often found in high-altitude habitats, making it a notable species in ecological studies of alpine flora."
