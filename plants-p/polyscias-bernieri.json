    "intro": "Polyscias bernieri, commonly known as the Hawaiian netleaf goosefoot, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its palmate, lobed leaves that resemble a net, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by oval, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Polyscias bernieri is also valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
