    "intro": "Periploca esculenta, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which contributes to its common name. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
