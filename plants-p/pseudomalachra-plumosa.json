It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescence.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its feathery appearance and drought tolerance."
