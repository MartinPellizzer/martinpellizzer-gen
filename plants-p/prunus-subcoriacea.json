    "intro": "Prunus subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-chinned cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered with a fine layer of pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible drupes that turn red or black as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Prunus subcoriacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
