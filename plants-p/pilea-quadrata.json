    "intro": "Pilea quadrata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often described as resembling Chinese coins, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea quadrata is relatively low maintenance and can be propagated easily through stem cuttings."
