    "intro": "Pleopeltis pseudolateralis, commonly known as the lateral-veined pleopeltis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically clustered in a rosette formation. The plant features a creeping rhizome with numerous adventitious roots, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, lateral vein pattern that gives it its common name. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on rocks or in humid forest understories."
