    "intro": "Pinalia sutepensis, commonly known as the Sutepensis pinalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cooler, humid climate. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Pinalia sutepensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
