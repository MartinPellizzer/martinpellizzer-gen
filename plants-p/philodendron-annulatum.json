    "intro": "Philodendron annulatum, commonly known as the curled-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often curled or wavy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has aerial roots that help it climb toward light, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a houseplant."
