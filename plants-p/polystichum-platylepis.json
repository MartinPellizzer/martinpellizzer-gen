    "intro": "Polystichum platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum platylepis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
