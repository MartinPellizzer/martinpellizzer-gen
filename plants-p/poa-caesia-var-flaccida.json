    "intro": "Poa caesia var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and delicate, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is notable for its low-growing structure and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
