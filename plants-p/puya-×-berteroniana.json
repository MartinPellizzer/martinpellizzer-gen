    "intro": "Puya \u00d7 berteroniana, commonly known as the hybrid torch cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Puya raimondii and Puya chilensis. It is native to the Atacama Desert in Chile, where it thrives in arid and saline conditions. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It has a rosette growth habit and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
