    "intro": "Pyramidostylium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered pyramid plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, pyramidal growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbellifers, while its fruits are small, dry schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
