    "intro": "Pavetta angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, with simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Pavetta angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures for medicinal purposes."
