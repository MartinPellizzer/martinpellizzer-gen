It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom briefly. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its short flowering period, it is considered a rare and ephemeral species."
