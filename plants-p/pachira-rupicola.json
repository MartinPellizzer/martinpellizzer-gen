    "intro": "Pachira rupicola, commonly known as the rock pachira, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by round, greenish fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
