    "intro": "Paspalum reptatum, commonly known as\u530d\u5310 grass or creeping paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomes that allow it to form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in wet or disturbed areas. Paspalum reptatum is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
