    "intro": "Pterocephalus khorassanicus, commonly known as the Afghan ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, purple to blue flowers. The plant produces a unique, spiny fruit known as a cypsela, which is adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
