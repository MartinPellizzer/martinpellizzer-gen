    "intro": "Pinus pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-needle pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its distinctive five-needle clusters, which give it its common name. The needles are typically dark green, stiff, and have a slight bluish tinge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
