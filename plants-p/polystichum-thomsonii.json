    "intro": "Polystichum thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum thomsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
