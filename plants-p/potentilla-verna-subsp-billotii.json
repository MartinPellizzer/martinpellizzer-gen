    "intro": "Potentilla verna subsp. billotii, commonly known as the early potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and early blooming habit."
