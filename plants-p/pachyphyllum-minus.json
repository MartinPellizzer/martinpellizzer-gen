    "intro": "Pachyphyllum minus, commonly known as the small stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a typical adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its slow growth rate and compact size make it an ideal plant for container gardening."
