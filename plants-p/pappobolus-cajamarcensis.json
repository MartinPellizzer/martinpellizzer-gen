    "intro": "Pappobolus cajamarcensis, commonly known as the Andean burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is notable for its unique structure, featuring a hairy, spiny stem and small, clustered flowers. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Pappobolus cajamarcensis is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments."
