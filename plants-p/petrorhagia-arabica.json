    "intro": "Petrorhagia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian rock rose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Petrorhagia arabica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
