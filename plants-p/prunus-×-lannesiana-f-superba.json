    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. superba, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its large, double flowers that consist of numerous petal-like structures, giving it a more elaborate appearance compared to single-flowered varieties. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and serrated along the edges. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, adding ornamental value to gardens. The fruit, if produced, is a small, sweet cherry that is typically edible but less prominent than the showy flowers."
