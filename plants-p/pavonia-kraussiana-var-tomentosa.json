It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warmer climates."
