    "intro": "Papaver nudicaule var. latilobatum, commonly known as the broad-lobed poppy, is a variant of the common poppy, characterized by its distinctive, broad, and lobed petals. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States, particularly California, where it thrives in rocky and open habitats. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lobed and hairy, and the stems are often branched and upright. The seeds are contained in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
