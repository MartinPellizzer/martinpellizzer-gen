    "intro": "Panicum smithii, commonly known as Smith's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are often visible in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in wetland ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a wetland indicator species."
