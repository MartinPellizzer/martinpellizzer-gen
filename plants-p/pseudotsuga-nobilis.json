    "intro": "Pseudotsuga nobilis, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are flattened and dark green on top. The tree produces cones that hang downward, containing edible seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is thick, scaly, and reddish-brown, providing protection against fire and pests. The Douglas fir is valued for its strong, durable wood and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
