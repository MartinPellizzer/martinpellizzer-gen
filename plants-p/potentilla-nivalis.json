    "intro": "Potentilla nivalis, commonly known as the snow willow, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Potentilla nivalis is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in extreme climates."
