    "intro": "Polygala stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and woodland habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length. Its flowers are pink to purple and are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, adding visual interest to its foliage. Polygala stricta is known for its medicinal properties and has been used by Indigenous peoples for various traditional purposes."
