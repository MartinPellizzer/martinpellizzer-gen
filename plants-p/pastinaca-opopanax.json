    "intro": "Pastinaca opopanax, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is not as well-known or widely cultivated as other members of its family."
