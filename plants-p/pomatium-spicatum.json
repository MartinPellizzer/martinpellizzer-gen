    "intro": "Pomatium spicatum, commonly known as the spiky pond mussel, is a freshwater bivalve mollusk characterized by its elongated, calcareous shell. The shell is typically elongated and has a spiky, irregularly sculptured surface, which gives it its common name. It is found in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it attaches to submerged vegetation or substrates. The species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by filtering water and contributing to nutrient cycling. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its habitat."
