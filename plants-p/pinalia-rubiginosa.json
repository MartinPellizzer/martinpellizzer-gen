    "intro": "Pinalia rubiginosa, commonly known as the rusty pinyon, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of red-brown seeds. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and elevations ranging from 1,500 to 6,000 feet. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellow, and it is pollinated by insects. Pinalia rubiginosa is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in desert landscapes."
