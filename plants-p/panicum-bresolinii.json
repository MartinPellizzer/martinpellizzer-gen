    "intro": "Panicum bresolinii, commonly known as Bresolin's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. Bresolin's bluestem plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
