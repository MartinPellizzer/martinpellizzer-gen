    "intro": "Protangiopteris somae, commonly known as the Soma fern, is a prehistoric plant that lived during the late Paleozoic era. It belongs to the genus Protangiopteris, which is part of the order Sphenophyta, commonly referred to as the horsetail order. The plant had a tall, tree-like structure with a central trunk and branching fronds, resembling early vascular plants. Its leaves were simple and arranged in a whorled pattern, and it possessed a well-developed vascular system for transporting water and nutrients. Fossil records indicate that it thrived in swampy environments, contributing to the formation of coal deposits."
