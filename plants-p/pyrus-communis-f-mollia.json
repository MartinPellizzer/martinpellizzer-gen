    "intro": "Pyrus communis f. mollia, commonly known as the woolly pear. This cultivar is a fruiting form of the common pear, characterized by its dense, soft, white pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The foliage is notably fuzzy, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It is typically found in temperate regions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. While it produces small, edible fruits, its primary appeal lies in its unique texture and visual characteristics."
