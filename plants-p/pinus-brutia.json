    "intro": "Pinus brutia, commonly known as the Turkish fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture. Pinus brutia is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
