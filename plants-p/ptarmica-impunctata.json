    "intro": "Ptarmica impunctata, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often form dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ptarmica impunctata is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, and it is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats."
