    "intro": "Paronychia chilensis subsp. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with strong winds and salt spray. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
