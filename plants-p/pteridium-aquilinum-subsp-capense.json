    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. capense, commonly known as the Cape bracken, is a fern species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, rocky outcrops, and forest margins. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in dry conditions."
