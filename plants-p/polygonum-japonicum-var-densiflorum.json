    "intro": "Polygonum japonicum var. densiflorum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in urban environments. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
