    "intro": "Potentilla glabriuscula var. oligandra, commonly known as the slender cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are typically narrow, elliptic, and covered with fine, short hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes."
