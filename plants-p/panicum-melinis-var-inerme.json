    "intro": "Panicum melinis var. inerme, commonly known as sanddrop or red sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, fluffy seed heads that are often pink or red in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in erosion control due to its ability to stabilize soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
