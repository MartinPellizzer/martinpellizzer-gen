    "intro": "Pteris parkeri, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lace-like pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris parkeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
