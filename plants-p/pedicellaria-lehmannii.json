    "intro": "Pedicellaria lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's pedicellaria, is a species of sea holly native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a flowering plant characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in coastal flora."
