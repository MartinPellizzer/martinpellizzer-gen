    "intro": "Pictetia ternata, commonly known as the three-leaf fig or pictetia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or green when mature. Pictetia ternata is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
