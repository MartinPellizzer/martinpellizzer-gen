    "intro": "Polyosma latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf polyosma, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Polyosma latifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
