    "intro": "Pleopeltis areolata, commonly known as the punctate rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented fronds with a rugged, textured appearance. The plant's leaves are typically divided into small, lobed segments, giving it a unique, lace-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
