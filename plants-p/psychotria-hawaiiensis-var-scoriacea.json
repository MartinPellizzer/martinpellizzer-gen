    "intro": "Psychotria hawaiiensis var. scoriacea, commonly known as the Hawaiian psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has elliptical leaves with a rough, scaly texture, which is reflected in its scientific name \"scoriacea,\" meaning resembling scorched or sooty. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests. This variety is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in Hawaiian ecosystems."
