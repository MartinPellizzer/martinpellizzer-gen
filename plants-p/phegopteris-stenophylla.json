    "intro": "Phegopteris stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. The fronds are often divided into smaller segments, which help in maximizing light absorption and gas exchange in its aquatic habitat."
