    "intro": "Pyrus communis subsp. orientaleuropaea, commonly known as the European pear, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, sweet, and sometimes aromatic fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other pear varieties."
