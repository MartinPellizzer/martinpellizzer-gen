    "intro": "Pteris ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty brake, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown spore mass. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year of growth."
