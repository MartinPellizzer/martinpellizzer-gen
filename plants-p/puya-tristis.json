    "intro": "Puya tristis, commonly known as the \"lamented puya,\" is a striking member of the bromeliad family, native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height, bearing numerous vibrant red, orange, and yellow flowers. The plant produces fibrous, leaf-like bracts that encase the flowers, giving it a unique and dramatic appearance. Puya tristis is a monocarpic plant, meaning it flowers once and then dies, making its blooming event a rare and significant natural occurrence. Its botanical features make it a popular subject in botanical gardens and a symbol of resilience in its native habitat."
