    "intro": "Poa marshallii, commonly known as Marshall's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, compact clumps. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils, and is adapted to arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color. Poa marshallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and visual texture."
