    "intro": "Pleopeltis himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan rock fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis himalayensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
