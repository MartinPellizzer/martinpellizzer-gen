    "intro": "Pistolochia solida var. trichophora, commonly known as the hairy pistol pod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, pod-like fruits that resemble small pistols, hence its common name. The plant features slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are small, purple, and clustered in dense spikes, contributing to its ornamental value. The varietal form, trichophora, is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering on the stems and fruits, which provides a unique botanical feature."
