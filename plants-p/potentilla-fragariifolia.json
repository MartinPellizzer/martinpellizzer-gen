    "intro": "Potentilla fragariifolia, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has wiry, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Potentilla fragariifolia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
