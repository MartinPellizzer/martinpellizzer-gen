    "intro": "Polypodium loretense, commonly known as the Loretense Shield Fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
