It features slender, grass-like leaves with a soft, hairy texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Its adaptability makes it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
