    "intro": "Phacelia secunda subsp. plantaginea, commonly known as the Sierra phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
