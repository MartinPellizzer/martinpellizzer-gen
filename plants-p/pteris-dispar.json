    "intro": "Pteris dispar, commonly known as the scattered water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to soil or rock surfaces. Pteris dispar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
