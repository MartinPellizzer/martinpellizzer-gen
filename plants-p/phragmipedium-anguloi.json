    "intro": "Phragmipedium anguloi, commonly known as the angular phragmipedium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that typically feature a deep purple or violet hue with contrasting yellow markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape, and it prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Phragmipedium anguloi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
