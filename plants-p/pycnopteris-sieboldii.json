    "intro": "Pycnopteris sieboldii, commonly known as the Siebold's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to soil or rocky substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
