It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
