The plant typically blooms in early spring and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Phacelia humilis is valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
