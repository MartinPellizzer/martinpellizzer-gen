    "intro": "Polypodium oodes, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it anchor to substrates. Polypodium oodes prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forested areas."
