    "intro": "Paullinia neuroptera, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal regions and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems."
