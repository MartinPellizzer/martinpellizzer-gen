    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris var. mollis, commonly known as the softleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
