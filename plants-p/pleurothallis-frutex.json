It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that often grow in a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and growth habit, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
