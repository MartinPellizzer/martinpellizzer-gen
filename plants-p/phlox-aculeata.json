    "intro": "Phlox aculeata, commonly known as the prickly phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features upright, branching stems covered with stiff, glandular hairs that give it a slightly prickly texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Phlox aculeata prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
