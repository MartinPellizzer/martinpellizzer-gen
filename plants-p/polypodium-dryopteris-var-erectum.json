    "intro": "Polypodium dryopteris var. erectum, commonly known as the erect fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that grow in a compact, shrub-like form. The plant typically features bipinnate leaves with a serrated or toothed margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clusters."
