    "intro": "Poa elliptica, commonly known as the oval bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense turf-like vegetation. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it resilient in various soil conditions. Poa elliptica is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed sites, contributing to ecological stability in its habitat."
