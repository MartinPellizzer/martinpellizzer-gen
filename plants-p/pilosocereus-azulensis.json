    "intro": "Pilosocereus azulensis, commonly known as the Blue Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers during the warmer months, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil. The plant is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
