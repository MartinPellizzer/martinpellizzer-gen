    "intro": "Piora ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically green or grayish in color. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white. Piora ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is a characteristic component of tundra vegetation."
