It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by clustered, orange-red fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens around the world."
