    "intro": "Polypodium gordonii, commonly known as Gordon's hart's tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that resemble the shape of a hart's tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib. Polypodium gordonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
