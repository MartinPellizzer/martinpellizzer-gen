    "intro": "Poa angustiglumis, commonly known as narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing turf. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its fine texture and resilience, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
