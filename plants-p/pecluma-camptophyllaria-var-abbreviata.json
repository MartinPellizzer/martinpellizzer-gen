    "intro": "Pecluma camptophyllaria var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-leafed pecluma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes a wide range of flowering plants, some of which are economically important. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often hairy leaves that are shorter than those of the typical variety. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
