    "intro": "Pedicularis rigidescens, commonly known as the rigid sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
