    "intro": "Pinguicula, commonly known as the butterwort, is a genus of carnivorous plants characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insect prey. These plants are typically found in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and rocky habitats. The leaves are broad and often covered in a layer of mucilage, which helps in capturing small insects. Pinguicula species vary in size, with some having small, delicate leaves while others produce larger, more robust ones. They are native to temperate and tropical regions across the globe, showcasing a wide range of adaptations to their specific ecological niches."
