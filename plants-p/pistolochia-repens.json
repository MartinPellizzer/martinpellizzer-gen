    "intro": "Pistolochia repens, commonly known as the creeping pistolpod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. The botanical characteristics of Pistolochia repens make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and ecological research."
