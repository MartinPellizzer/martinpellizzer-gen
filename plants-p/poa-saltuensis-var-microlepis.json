    "intro": "Poa saltuensis var. microlepis, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense, compact tufts with slender, hairy leaves that are often less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
