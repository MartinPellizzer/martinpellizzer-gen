    "intro": "Picea abies f. ellwangeriana, commonly known as the Ellwangerian Norway spruce, is a compact, slow-growing form of the Norway spruce. It features dense, pyramidal foliage with short, stout needles that are a deep green color. The plant is characterized by its reduced growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates."
