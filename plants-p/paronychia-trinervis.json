    "intro": "Paronychia trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined sandwort, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually arranged in three rows, giving it the species name *trinervis*. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability."
