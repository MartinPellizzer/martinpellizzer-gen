    "intro": "Pseudiosma, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water conservation. The flowers are often showy, with complex structures that attract specific pollinators. Pseudiosma species are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments."
