    "intro": "Psammisia incana, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and desert environments. It has a low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy, grayish foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Psammisia incana is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
