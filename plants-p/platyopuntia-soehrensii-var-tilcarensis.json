    "intro": "Platyopuntia soehrensii var. tilcarensis, commonly known as the Tiltcarensis Prickly Pear, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh conditions."
