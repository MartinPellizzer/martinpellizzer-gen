    "intro": "Phegopteris punctata var. rugosula, commonly known as the rough fringed fern, is a variant of the broad buckler fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a rough, textured appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it a distinctive species within the fern family."
