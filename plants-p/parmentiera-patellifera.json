    "intro": "Parmentiera patellifera, commonly known as the desert bean or Mexican bean tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Parmentiera patellifera is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and the ability to store water in its stems. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid environments."
