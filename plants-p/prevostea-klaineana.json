    "intro": "Prevostea klaineana, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Prevostea klaineana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soil."
