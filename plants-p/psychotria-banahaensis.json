It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by various bird species. Psychotria banahaensis is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
