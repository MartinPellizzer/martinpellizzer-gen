    "intro": "Polypogon intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate grass or buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
