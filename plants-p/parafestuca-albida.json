    "intro": "Parafestuca albida, commonly known as the white feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Parafestuca albida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
