    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. agrostoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and grassy slopes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is usually shorter than the leaves, bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
