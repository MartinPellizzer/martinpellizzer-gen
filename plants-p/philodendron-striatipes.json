    "intro": "Philodendron striatipes, commonly known as the zebra philodendron, is a climbing tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and cream patterns, often resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant has heart-shaped to arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically large and glossy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that are edible for some bird species. Philodendron striatipes thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil."
