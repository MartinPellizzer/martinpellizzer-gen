    "intro": "Pasania wenshanensis, commonly known as the Wenshan pasania, is a flowering plant native to China, specifically the Wenshan region in Yunnan Province. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth, and prefers well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat."
