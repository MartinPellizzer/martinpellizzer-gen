    "intro": "Peucedanum hispidum, commonly known as the hairy cowparsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, and the plant is known for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds similar to those found in other members of the carrot family."
