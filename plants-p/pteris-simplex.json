    "intro": "Pteris simplex, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds from the base. Its leaves are typically green and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pteris simplex is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
