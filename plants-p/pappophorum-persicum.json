It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bristly, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in arid regions."
