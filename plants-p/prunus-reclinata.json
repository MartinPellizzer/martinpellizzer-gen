    "intro": "Prunus reclinata, commonly known as the weeping cherry or Japanese weeping cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn. Prunus reclinata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for."
