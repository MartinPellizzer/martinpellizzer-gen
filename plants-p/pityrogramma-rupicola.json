    "intro": "Pityrogramma rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its leaves are usually bi-lobed and have a finely divided structure, which aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns."
