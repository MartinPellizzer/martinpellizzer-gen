    "intro": "Pimpinella paludosa, commonly known as marsh parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Pimpinella paludosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
