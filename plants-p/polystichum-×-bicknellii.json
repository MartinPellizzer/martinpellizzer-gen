    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 bicknellii, commonly known as the Bicknell's wood fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a feathery, compound structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, lush foliage."
