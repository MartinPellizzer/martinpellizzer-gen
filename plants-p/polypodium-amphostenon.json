    "intro": "Polypodium amphostenon, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in forested areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
