    "intro": "Pelargonium dioicum, commonly known as the double-flowered geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is characterized by its showy, double blooms that consist of both stamens and petals, giving it a more elaborate appearance than typical geraniums. Native to South Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its foliage is usually dark green and slightly hairy, while the stems are sturdy and upright. Pelargonium dioicum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting flowers."
