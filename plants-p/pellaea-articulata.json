    "intro": "Pellaea articulata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented fronds that give it a zigzag appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that helps in attracting pollinators. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds."
