    "intro": "Potentilla arenosa subsp. chamissonis, commonly known as Chamisson's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with numerous stems arising from a central base. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes or roadsides."
