    "intro": "Pitcairnia redouteana, commonly known as the Redoute's pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can be pink, red, or purple, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This bromeliad is also valued for its ability to store water in its leaf rosette, adapting to its native high-altitude environment."
