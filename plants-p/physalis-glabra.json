    "intro": "Physalis glabra, commonly known as the common husk tomato, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into the distinctive inflated, papery calyces surrounding the orange-red berries. These berries, which are edible when ripe, contain several small, hard seeds. Physalis glabra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in some traditional cuisines."
