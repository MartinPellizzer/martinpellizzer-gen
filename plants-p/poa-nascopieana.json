    "intro": "Poa nascopieana, commonly known as the Nascopie grass, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Nascopie region of New York. It is a low-growing perennial grass with slender, tufted culms and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poa nascopieana is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native environment."
