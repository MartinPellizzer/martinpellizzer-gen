    "intro": "Pedicularis xiqingshanensis, commonly known as the Qixing Mountain Beardplant, is a rare alpine species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with distinctive red or purple markings. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
