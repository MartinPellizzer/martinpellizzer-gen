    "intro": "Pepinia turbinella, commonly known as the Turban Pepper or Turban Flower, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, edible berries that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution, Pepinia turbinella is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
