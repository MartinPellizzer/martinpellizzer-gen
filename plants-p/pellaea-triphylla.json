    "intro": "Pellaea triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pellaeaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina, Chile, and Peru, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three narrow, elongated segments. Pellaea triphylla is typically found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
