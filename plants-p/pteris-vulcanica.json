    "intro": "Pteris vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, dark brown coating, which helps in water retention. Pteris vulcanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
