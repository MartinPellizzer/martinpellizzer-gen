    "intro": "Polylepis incana subsp. villosistyla, commonly known as the woolly polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bark, which provide insulation against the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in cloud forests, and is adapted to the harsh climate of the Andes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in its native environment, supporting various forms of biodiversity."
