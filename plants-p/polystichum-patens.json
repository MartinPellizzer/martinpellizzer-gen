    "intro": "Polystichum patens, commonly known as the spreading wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium."
