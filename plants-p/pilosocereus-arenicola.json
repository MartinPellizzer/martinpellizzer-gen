    "intro": "Pilosocereus arenicola, commonly known as the sand hedge cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and dense clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and minimal rainfall. Its structure provides habitat for small animals and insects, contributing to the ecological balance of its desert environment. Pilosocereus arenicola is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and cactus collections."
