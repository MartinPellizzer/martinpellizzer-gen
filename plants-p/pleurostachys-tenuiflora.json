It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
