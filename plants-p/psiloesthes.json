    "intro": "Psiloesthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves and relies solely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its delicate, white or pale green flowers are highly specialized, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat requirements and limited distribution, Psiloesthes is considered a vulnerable species."
