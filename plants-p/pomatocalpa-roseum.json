    "intro": "Pomatocalpa roseum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features a unique, showy flower with a deep pink hue and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that aids in pollination. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture."
