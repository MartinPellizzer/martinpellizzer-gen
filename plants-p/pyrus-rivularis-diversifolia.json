    "intro": "Pyrus rivularis diversifolia, commonly known as the river pear, is a unique species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and elongated, drooping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. This plant thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found near rivers and streams."
