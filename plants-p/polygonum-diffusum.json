It features upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The leaves are broadly ovate to rhomboidal, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-angled berries. This plant is often found in moist soils along streambanks and in wetlands."
