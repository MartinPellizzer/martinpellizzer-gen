    "intro": "Portulacaria afra f. microphylla, commonly known as the elephant bush or African ice plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, thick, fleshy leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by pale pink or white fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions."
