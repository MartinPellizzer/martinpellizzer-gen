    "intro": "Panicum tenue, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of fine, hair-like leaves that are often less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its drought tolerance and ability to colonize barren ground make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
