It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of wetlands. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Peutalis floridana is an important species for local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
