    "intro": "Polypodium fibrillosum, commonly known as the fibrous shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. This plant is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
