    "intro": "Phlomis herba-venti var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and tall spikes of pale blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
