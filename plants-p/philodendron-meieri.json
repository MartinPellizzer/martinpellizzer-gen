    "intro": "Philodendron meieri, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Philodendron meieri is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
