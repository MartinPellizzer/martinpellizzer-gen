    "intro": "Pyrostria oligophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined pyrostria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with finely veined patterns that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
