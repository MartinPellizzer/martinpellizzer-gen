    "intro": "Polystichopsis puberula, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
