It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
