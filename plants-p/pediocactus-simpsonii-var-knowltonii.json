It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical shape and bright green to bluish-green stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its succulent stems store water, and it has spines that provide protection from herbivores."
