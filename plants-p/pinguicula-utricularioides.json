    "intro": "Pinguicula utricularioides, commonly known as the bladderwort orchid, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its small, pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces delicate, orchid-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized morphology and habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
