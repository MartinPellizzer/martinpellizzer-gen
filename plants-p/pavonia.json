These plants are native to the Americas and are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. Pavonia species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce legumes as fruit, which contain seeds. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions. They are also sometimes used in traditional medicine."
