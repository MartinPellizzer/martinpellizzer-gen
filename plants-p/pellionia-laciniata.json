    "intro": "Pellionia laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaf pellionia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle and related plants. The plant is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Pellionia laciniata is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
