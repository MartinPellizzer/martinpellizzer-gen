    "intro": "Phleboanthe, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. They are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Phleboanthe species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to withstand drought conditions. Their ability to store water in their thick stems and leaves makes them well-suited for xerophytic environments."
