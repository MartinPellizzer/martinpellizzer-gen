    "intro": "Paracaleana ferricola, commonly known as the ironwood orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces striking violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, which is crucial for its survival in nutrient-poor conditions. Paracaleana ferricola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
