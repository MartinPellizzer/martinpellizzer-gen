    "intro": "Phaeostoma mildrediae, commonly known as the Mildred's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white petals and a unique, ghostly appearance that gives it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically forming a single, low-growing stem with a few small leaves. Its flowers are ephemeral, blooming only briefly during the cooler months, which makes it a challenging subject for botanical study. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaeostoma mildrediae is considered a species of conservation concern."
