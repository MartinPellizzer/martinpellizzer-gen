    "intro": "Pneumatopteris sibelana, commonly known as the Sibelana water fern, is a rare and ancient species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of more primitive ferns, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship with early land plants. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pneumatopteris sibelana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
