    "intro": "Phoradendron rubrum var. longispicum, commonly known as the long-spined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's berries are red and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, facilitating dispersal. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and spines, which give it its common name. This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
