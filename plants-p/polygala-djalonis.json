    "intro": "Polygala djalonis, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the savannas of West Africa. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, often yellow or greenish-white, pea-like flowers that are typically arranged in spikes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually oval-shaped with a rough texture. Polygala djalonis is adapted to dry conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
