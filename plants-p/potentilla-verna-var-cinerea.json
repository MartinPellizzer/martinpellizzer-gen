    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. cinerea, commonly known as gray willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and meadows. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
