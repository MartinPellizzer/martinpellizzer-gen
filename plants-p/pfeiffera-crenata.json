    "intro": "Pfeiffera crenata, commonly known as the crested pfeiffera, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often branched stems. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pfeiffera crenata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
