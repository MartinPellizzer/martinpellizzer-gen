    "intro": "Peliosanthes grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered peliosanthes, is a rare and endangered plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a distinctive, aromatic scent and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy texture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
