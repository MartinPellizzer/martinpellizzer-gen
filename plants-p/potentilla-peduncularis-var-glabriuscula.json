    "intro": "Potentilla peduncularis var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features wiry, branching stems that are typically covered with fine, soft hairs, though the variety glabriuscula is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a leathery texture. This variety is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
