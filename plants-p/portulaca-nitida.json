    "intro": "Portulaca nitida, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Portulaca nitida is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
