    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor habitats by supplementing its diet with insect prey."
