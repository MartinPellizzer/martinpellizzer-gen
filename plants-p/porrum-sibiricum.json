    "intro": "Porrum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian potato, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It produces tubers that are adapted to survive in harsh, frost-prone environments. The plant has a robust root system and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are large and heart-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The tubers are often used as a food source by both humans and animals in its native habitat."
