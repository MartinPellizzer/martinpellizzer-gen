    "intro": "Prunus sargentii f. compta, commonly known as the Sargent cherry, is a compact form of the Sargent cherry tree, native to China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often considered astringent. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and seasonal interest make it a popular choice for smaller landscapes."
