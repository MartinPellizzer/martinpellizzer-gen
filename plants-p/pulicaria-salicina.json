    "intro": "Pulicaria salicina, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Pulicaria salicina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
