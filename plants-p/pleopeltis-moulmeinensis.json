    "intro": "Pleopeltis moulmeinensis, commonly known as the Moulmein fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, which helps in moisture retention. The fronds are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive appearance."
