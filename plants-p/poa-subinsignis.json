    "intro": "Poa subinsignis, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist to wet meadows, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Poa subinsignis is an important component of native plant communities in its range."
