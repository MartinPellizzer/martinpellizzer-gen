    "intro": "Polemanniopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, slender stems and small, delicate flowers that often resemble ghostly shapes. Its leaves are typically green and lance-shaped, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on specialized structures called pseudobulbs. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Polemanniopsis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
