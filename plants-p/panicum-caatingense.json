    "intro": "Panicum caatingense, commonly known as caatinga grass, is a perennial grass native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
