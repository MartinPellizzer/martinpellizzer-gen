It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It has small, narrow leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
