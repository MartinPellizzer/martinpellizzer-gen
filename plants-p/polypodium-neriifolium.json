    "intro": "Polypodium neriifolium, commonly known as the black-leafed polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium neriifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
