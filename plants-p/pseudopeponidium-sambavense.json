It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its violet or purple flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. Due to its restricted distribution and limited research, it remains a lesser-known but ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
