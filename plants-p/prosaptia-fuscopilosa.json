    "intro": "Prosaptia fuscopilosa, commonly known as the black-spined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prosaptia fuscopilosa is considered a conservation concern."
