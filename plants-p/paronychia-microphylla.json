    "intro": "Paronychia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. Paronychia microphylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
