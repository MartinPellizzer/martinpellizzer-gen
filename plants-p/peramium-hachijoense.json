    "intro": "Peramium hachijoense, commonly known as the Hachijo Island peramium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Japanese island of Hachijo-jima. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, saline conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peramium hachijoense is considered an endangered species."
