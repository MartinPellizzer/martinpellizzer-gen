    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. scabriuscula, commonly known as rough meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, scabrous texture, which gives it its scientific name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. This variant is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
