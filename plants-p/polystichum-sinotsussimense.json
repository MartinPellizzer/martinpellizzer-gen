    "intro": "Polystichum sinotsussimense, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
