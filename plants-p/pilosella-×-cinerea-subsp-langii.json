    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 cinerea subsp. langii, commonly known as the silverleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
