It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The true flowers of the plant are small and clustered in the center of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Poinsettias are popular holiday plants due to their striking appearance and seasonal availability."
