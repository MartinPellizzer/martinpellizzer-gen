    "intro": "Peschiera benthamiana var. stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peschiera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely arranged along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
