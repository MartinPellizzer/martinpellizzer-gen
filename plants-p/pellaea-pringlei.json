    "intro": "Pellaea pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive, sword-like shape that gives it its common name. Pellaea pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
