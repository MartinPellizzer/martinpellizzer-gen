    "intro": "Plectronia carinata, commonly known as the mountain holly or holly fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinct midrib and produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Plectronia carinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
