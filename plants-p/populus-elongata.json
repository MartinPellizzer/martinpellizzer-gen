    "intro": "Populus elongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips. Populus elongata is often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in floodplains."
