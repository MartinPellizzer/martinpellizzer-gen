    "intro": "Phoebanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered phoebanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
