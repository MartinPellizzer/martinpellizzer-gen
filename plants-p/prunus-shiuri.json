    "intro": "Prunus shiuri, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or dwarf cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal beauty. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Prunus shiuri is also valued for its use in traditional Japanese culture, particularly in cherry blossom viewing events."
