    "intro": "Polypodium vulcanicum, commonly known as the fire fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often curled or rolled when dry. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium vulcanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
