    "intro": "Poa annua subsp. varia, commonly known as the variable annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas such as lawns, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, it can be both a desirable turfgrass and a weed, depending on the context."
