    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
