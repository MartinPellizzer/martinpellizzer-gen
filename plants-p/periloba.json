    "intro": "Periloba, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length and vibrant purple flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective indicator of nutrient-rich waters, though it can also become invasive. Periloba plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
