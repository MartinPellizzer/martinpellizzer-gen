    "intro": "Poa misera var. alpina, commonly known as alpine sorrowgrass, is a variant of the slender meadowgrass species. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, pale green to blue-gray flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or open, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
