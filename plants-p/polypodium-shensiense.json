    "intro": "Polypodium shensiense, commonly known as the Sichuan shield fern, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
