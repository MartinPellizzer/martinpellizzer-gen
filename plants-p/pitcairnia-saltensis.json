    "intro": "Pitcairnia saltensis, commonly known as the salt marsh pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to coastal regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding basin, a common adaptation for surviving in arid or saline environments. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Pitcairnia saltensis produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
