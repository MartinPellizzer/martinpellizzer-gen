    "intro": "Pseudocassia, commonly known as golden shower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble showers of golden beads. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Pseudocassia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
