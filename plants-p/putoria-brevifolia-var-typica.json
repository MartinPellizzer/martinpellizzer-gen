It is a small shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils."
