    "intro": "Polystachya eurygnatha, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a member of the Polystachyaceae family. It is a tropical evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and compact, clustered growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Polystachya eurygnatha plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
