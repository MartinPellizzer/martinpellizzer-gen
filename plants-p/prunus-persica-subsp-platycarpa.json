    "intro": "Prunus persica subsp. platycarpa, commonly known as the flatpods peach, is a subspecies of the peach that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is distinguished by its flattened, elongated fruit pods, which differ from the typical rounded shape of common peaches. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typical of the Prunus genus. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This subspecies is often found in regions with temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental and potential fruiting qualities."
