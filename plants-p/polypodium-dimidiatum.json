    "intro": "Polypodium dimidiatum, commonly known as the split-fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two unequal parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Polypodium dimidiatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
