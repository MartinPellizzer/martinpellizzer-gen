    "intro": "Piper affectans, commonly known as the poisonwood plant, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine with caution."
