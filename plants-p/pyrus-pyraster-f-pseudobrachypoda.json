    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. pseudobrachypoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a horticultural form of the common pear. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and smaller, often less showy flowers compared to the typical pear species. This form is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. The fruit, when it develops, is usually small and not as flavorful as the standard pear. It is valued in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and historical horticultural significance."
