    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 garraudiana, commonly known as the hybrid pear, is a deciduous tree that belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyraster (wild pear), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The tree typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and produces oval, green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are white and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a small, yellowish pear that is not typically cultivated for commercial use but is of interest in botanical studies."
