    "intro": "Pholistoma auritum var. arizonicum, commonly known as the Arizona earleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive ear-like projection at the base, and it produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This variety is noted for its resilience to drought and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
