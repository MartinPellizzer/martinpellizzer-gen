    "intro": "Pronaya fraseri var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Fraser's pronaya, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in coastal landscapes."
