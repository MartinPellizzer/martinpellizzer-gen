    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. heredia, commonly known as the Heredia bracken, is a fern species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and ecological significance in tropical and subtropical regions."
