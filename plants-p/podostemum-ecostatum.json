It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant has a specialized root system that anchors it to rocky substrates, allowing it to thrive in turbulent environments. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, emerging from the water surface. Podostemum ecostatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
