    "intro": "Plinia ybotyrype, commonly known as the Ybotyrype guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, with a sweet and aromatic flavor. It thrives in warm, moist climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species within the Plinia genus."
