    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 subcanescens, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both landscape design and ecological restoration projects."
