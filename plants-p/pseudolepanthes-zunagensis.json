    "intro": "Pseudolepanthes zunagensis, commonly known as the Zunag\u00e9n's slipper orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a pouch-like lip used to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, displaying a range of colors from white to pale purple, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pseudolepanthes zunagensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
