    "intro": "Polypodium crispum, commonly known as the curly maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. Polypodium crispum reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds."
