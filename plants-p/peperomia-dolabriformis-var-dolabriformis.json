    "intro": "Peperomia dolabriformis var. dolabriformis, commonly known as the broadleaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, and somewhat fleshy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it ideal for use in containers or as part of a foliage-only arrangement."
