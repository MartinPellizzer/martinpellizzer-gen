    "intro": "Primula calthifolia, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Primula calthifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine habitats."
