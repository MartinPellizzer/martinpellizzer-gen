    "intro": "Potentilla incana var. arenicola, commonly known as sand buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to dry conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
