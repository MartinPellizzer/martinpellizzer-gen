It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in a fuzzy texture, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
