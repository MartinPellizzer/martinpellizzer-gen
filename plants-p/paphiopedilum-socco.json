It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive yellow lip. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, typically arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
