    "intro": "Pholistoma racemosum, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or on the bases of trees. The plant has a thalloid structure with a prostrate stem that bears closely spaced, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short stalks and contain the spores necessary for propagation. Pholistoma racemosum is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of forest floor ecosystems."
