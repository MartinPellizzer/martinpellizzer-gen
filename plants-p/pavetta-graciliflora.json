    "intro": "Pavetta graciliflora, commonly known as slender-flowered pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, black seeds. Pavetta graciliflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
