    "intro": "Peperomia hydrocotyloides var. prolifera, commonly known as the creeping peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and red, which are typically borne on short, erect spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to propagate through stem cuttings makes it easy to grow and maintain."
