It is a slow-growing plant characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, woody pod and are dispersed by animals. Ptychosperma tenellum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
