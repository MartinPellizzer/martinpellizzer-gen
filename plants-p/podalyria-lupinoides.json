    "intro": "Podalyria lupinoides, commonly known as the purple mountain lupin, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of purple to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Podalyria lupinoides is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
