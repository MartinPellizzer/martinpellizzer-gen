    "intro": "Poa latispicea, commonly known as the broad-spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa latispicea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native range."
