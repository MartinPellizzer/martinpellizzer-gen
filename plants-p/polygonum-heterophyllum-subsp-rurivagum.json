    "intro": "Polygonum heterophyllum subsp. rurivagum, commonly known as the riverbank knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks, stream sides, and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, and produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense stands. The species is often considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
