    "intro": "Periphanes cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a short, stout rhizome that supports its tall, arching fronds, which are divided into segments with a unique, cinnamon-like scent when crushed. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
