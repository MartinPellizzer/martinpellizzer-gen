    "intro": "Primulina lingchuanensis, commonly known as the Lingchuan primula, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
