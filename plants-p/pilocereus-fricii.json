    "intro": "Pilocereus fricii, commonly known as the Frici's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to southern South America. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with flat, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its succulent structure allows it to thrive in arid environments with minimal rainfall. Pilocereus fricii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
