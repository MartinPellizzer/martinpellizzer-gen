    "intro": "Pinguicula gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, particularly in gypsum-rich environments. The plant features small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients. It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in isolated locations, making it a rare and unique species."
