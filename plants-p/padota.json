It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in a wide range of colors, often with a contrasting throat. Its leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Padota thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
