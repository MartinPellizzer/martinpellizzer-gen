    "intro": "Philodendron affine, commonly known as the creeping philodendron, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length. The plant typically has a trailing growth habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves. Its stems are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Philodendron affine is a member of the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix and spathe."
