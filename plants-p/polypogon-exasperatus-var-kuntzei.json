    "intro": "Polypogon exasperatus var. kuntzei, commonly known as the Kuntze's panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland habitats, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to moist environments, with rhizomes that aid in vegetative propagation."
