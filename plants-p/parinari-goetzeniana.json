It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The tree is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are yellow or orange, clustered in panicles, and it produces small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber due to its hard, durable wood."
