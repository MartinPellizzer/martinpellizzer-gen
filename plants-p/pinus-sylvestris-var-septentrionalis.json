    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The needles are typically two to three centimeters long and have a bluish-green color. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed cones that release seeds. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
