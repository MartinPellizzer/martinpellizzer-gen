    "intro": "Polygonum equisetiforme subsp. scoparium, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and slender, wiry stems. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is native to parts of Asia and is adapted to moist, disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an invasive species in some regions."
