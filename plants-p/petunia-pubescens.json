    "intro": "Petunia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy petunia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its hairy texture helps to reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Petunia pubescens is a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its vibrant blooms and adaptability to various growing conditions."
