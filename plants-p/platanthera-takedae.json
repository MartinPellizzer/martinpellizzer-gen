    "intro": "Platanthera takedae, commonly known as the Takeda's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its long, spiraling inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. It is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Botanically, it is notable for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships, which are essential for its nutrient uptake and survival."
