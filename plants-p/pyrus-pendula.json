    "intro": "Pyrus pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping pear, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its cascading branches that hang like curtains, creating a striking visual effect. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that turn yellow or red in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. Pyrus pendula is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for."
