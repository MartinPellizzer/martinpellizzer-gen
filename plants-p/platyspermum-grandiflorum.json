    "intro": "Platyspermum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered platyspermum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild."
