    "intro": "Pogostemon reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined pogostemon, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves with a distinctive net-like venation, and small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported cooling and anti-inflammatory properties."
