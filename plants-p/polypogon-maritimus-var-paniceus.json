    "intro": "Polypogon maritimus var. paniceus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline or brackish soils and is often found in dunes, marshes, and tidal flats. Its ability to stabilize coastal soils makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
