    "intro": "Pastinaca argyrophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking silver-gray foliage with a waxy texture, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful management."
