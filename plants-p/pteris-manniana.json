It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lacy pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing leaves. Pteris manniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
