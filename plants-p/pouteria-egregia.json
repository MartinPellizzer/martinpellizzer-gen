    "intro": "Pouteria egregia, commonly known as the yellow balsa or golden balsa, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree is notable for its lightweight, porous wood, which is highly buoyant and historically used for model-making and buoyancy devices. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant also has ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique fruit structure."
