    "intro": "Primula nanocapitata, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features compact, hairy stems that support clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and prominent stamens. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest in botanical conservation efforts."
