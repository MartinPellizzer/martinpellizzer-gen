    "intro": "Pavonia urbaniana var. tomentosa-velutina, commonly known as the velvety pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
