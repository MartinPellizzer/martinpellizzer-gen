    "intro": "Periandra berteroana, commonly known as the Peruvian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Periandra berteroana thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the high-altitude environments of the Andes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, although it remains relatively uncommon in horticultural trade."
