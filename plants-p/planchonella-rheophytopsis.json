It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows near streams and in moist, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water.
