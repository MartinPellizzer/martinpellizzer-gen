    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata f. lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its dense, soft, hairy covering on the leaves. This feature distinguishes it from the typical form of Plantago lanceolata, which has smoother foliage. The plant is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of leaves and produces erect flowering stems that bear bracts and a cluster of small flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, fields, and gardens. Botanically, it belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is valued for its medicinal and ecological properties."
