    "intro": "Patagonium psoraleoides, commonly known as the Patagonian broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its structure is characterized by a branched stem with reduced leaves. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing the growth of its host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it is often overlooked but contributes to the biodiversity of its environment."
