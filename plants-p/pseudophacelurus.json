It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescence that resembles a pincushion, with small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Pseudophacelurus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral display."
