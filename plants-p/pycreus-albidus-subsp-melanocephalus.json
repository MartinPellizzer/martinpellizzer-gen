It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black, floral bracts that contrast sharply with the lighter petals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grassland habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
