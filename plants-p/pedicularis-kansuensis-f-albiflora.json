    "intro": "Pedicularis kansuensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lousewort, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients. Native to the alpine regions of China, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
