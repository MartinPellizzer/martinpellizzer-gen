    "intro": "Pyrrosia oblanceolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features dark green, leathery, ovate to oblanceolate leaves that are often divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
