    "intro": "Potentilla recta subsp. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
