It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and gnarled branches that give it a striking, sculptural appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves emerge. It is often cultivated as an ornamental tree in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value. The Kinryu cherry is well-suited to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
