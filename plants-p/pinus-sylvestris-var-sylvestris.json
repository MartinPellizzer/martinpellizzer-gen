    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. sylvestris, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically two to five centimeters long. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed capsules that release winged seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. The Scots pine is an important species in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to carbon sequestration."
