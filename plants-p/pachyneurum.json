    "intro": "Pachyneurum, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including red, yellow, and orange. They typically have palmately lobed leaves and are often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Pachyneurum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
