    "intro": "Pteris dentata subsp. flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leaf water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are fan-shaped and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The fronds are typically green, with a soft texture and a light, airy appearance."
