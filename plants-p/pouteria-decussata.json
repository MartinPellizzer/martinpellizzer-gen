    "intro": "Pouteria decussata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The tree is notable for its distinctive fruit, which contains a single large, edible seed surrounded by a hard, woody shell. The fruit's outer layer, called the husk, is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Pouteria decussata plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a wide range of wildlife."
