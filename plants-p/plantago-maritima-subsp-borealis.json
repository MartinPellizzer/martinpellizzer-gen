    "intro": "Plantago maritima subsp. borealis, commonly known as sea plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
