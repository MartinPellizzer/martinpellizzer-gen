    "intro": "Phoenicaulis pedicellata, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces upright flowering stems that bear clusters of pinkish-purple, spurred orchid flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
