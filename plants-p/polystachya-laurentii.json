    "intro": "Polystachya laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentian pineapple orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers that resemble pineapples. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its native habitat. Polystachya laurentii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
