    "intro": "Pyrus ceratocarpa, commonly known as the horned crabapple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny fruit that resembles a crabapple in size and shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by green fruits that ripen to a yellow or red color in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
