    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. transversa, commonly known as the Transverse White Spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a flat, crosswise pattern on the shoots. The cones are usually pendulous, with elongated, slender scales, and the tree produces a distinctive, aromatic resin. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. This variety is often valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
