    "intro": "Populus illicitana, commonly known as the illicit poplar, is a rare and enigmatic species within the Populus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often a deep green with a slight pubescence on the underside. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common trait among poplars. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a tendency to flake in older specimens. Despite its botanical interest, Populus illicitana is extremely rare in the wild, with limited documented occurrences in specific geographic regions."
