    "intro": "Pinus fominii subsp. cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous pine, is a rare and ancient subspecies of pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of other pine species. The cones of this subspecies are small and often persist on the tree for several years, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and protected plant in its native habitat."
