    "intro": "Polygala myrtifolia var. pinifolia, commonly known as the coastal polygala, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
