It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it an important species for coastal stabilization. Its ability to grow in harsh conditions makes it valuable for ecological restoration projects."
