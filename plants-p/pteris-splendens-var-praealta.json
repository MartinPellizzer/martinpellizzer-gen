    "intro": "Pteris splendens var. praealta, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a strikingly large fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and requires consistently moist soil to flourish. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in wetland or marshy areas. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, almost lacy appearance that adds ornamental value to gardens and water features."
