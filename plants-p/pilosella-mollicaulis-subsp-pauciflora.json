    "intro": "Pilosella mollicaulis subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the slenderleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its reduced number of flowers per inflorescence, which is a key feature of the subspecies pauciflora. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its hairy foliage and compact growth form help it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions."
