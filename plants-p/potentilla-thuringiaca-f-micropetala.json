It features small, rounded leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, decorative shrub."
