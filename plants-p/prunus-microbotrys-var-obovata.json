    "intro": "Prunus microbotrys var. obovata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yaezakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue on the upper surface. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal."
