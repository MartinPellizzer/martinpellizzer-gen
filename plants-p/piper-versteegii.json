It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing the aromatic compound piperine, similar to black pepper. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while its stems are woody and often twining. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
