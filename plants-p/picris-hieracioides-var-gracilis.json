    "intro": "Picris hieracioides var. gracilis, commonly known as slender hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It produces yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance."
