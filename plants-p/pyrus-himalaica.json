    "intro": "Pyrus himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant features broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its fruit, a pear-like apple, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
