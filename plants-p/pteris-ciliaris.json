    "intro": "Pteris ciliaris, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. Pteris ciliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
