    "intro": "Polystichum radicans, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color that often has a metallic sheen. It thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in garden landscaping."
