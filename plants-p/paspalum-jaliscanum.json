    "intro": "Paspalum jaliscanum, commonly known as Mexican grass or Jaliscan paspalum, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typically flowering in the spring and summer months. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Paspalum jaliscanum is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ornamental grass due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
