    "intro": "Pharmacosycea grandaeva, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique trait among orchids. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The species is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its pharmacological applications."
