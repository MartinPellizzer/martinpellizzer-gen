    "intro": "Polypodium nivosum, commonly known as the snow fern, is a perennial fern native to the cool, humid forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a snow-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Polypodium nivosum is a slow-growing plant that plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
