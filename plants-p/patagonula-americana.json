    "intro": "Patagonula americana, commonly known as the American Patagonula, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the spring and summer, producing small yellow to orange petals surrounded by ray florets."
