    "intro": "Pitcairnia punicea, commonly known as the fireleaf pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, bright red foliage that resembles flames, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its native tropical climate. Pitcairnia punicea produces small, white flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal."
