    "intro": "Passerina prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate pasqueflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with five sepals and no true petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
