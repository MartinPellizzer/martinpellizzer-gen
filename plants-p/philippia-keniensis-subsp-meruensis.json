    "intro": "Philippia keniensis subsp. meruensis, commonly known as the Meru Philippia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-altitude grasslands of Kenya. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the cool, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from extinction."
