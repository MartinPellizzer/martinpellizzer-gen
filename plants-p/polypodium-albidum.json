    "intro": "Polypodium albidum, commonly known as the white cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are usually light green to white in color. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium albidum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
