    "intro": "Pictetia spinifolia var. ternata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pictetia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are elongated, narrow, and often slightly serrated. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
