    "intro": "Potentilla coronensis, commonly known as the Alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and hairy leaves that are often arranged in pairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar conditions."
