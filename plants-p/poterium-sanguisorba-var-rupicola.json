    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba var. rupicola, commonly known as redroot sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy pink to reddish flowers appear in late spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment."
