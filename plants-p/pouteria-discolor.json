    "intro": "Pouteria discolor, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces oval, woody fruits that contain a single large, edible seed, which is the source of the prized Brazil nut. Its growth is slow, and it can live for over 100 years, making it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
