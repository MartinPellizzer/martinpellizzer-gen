    "intro": "Pedersenia cardenasii, commonly known as the Cardenas's pedersenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
