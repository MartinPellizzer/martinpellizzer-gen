    "intro": "Plantago pachyphylla var. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to the arid and volcanic soils of its native habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in full sun and is often found in coastal and upland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
