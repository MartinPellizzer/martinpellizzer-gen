It features slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of tiny, white to pale green flowers, which are often clustered in dense spikes. It is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
