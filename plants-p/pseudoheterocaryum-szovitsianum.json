    "intro": "Pseudoheterocaryum szovitsianum, commonly known as the Hungarian false truffle, is a rare and elusive fungus belonging to the family Tulasnellaceae. It is characterized by its unique structure, which resembles a truffle but lacks the typical spore-bearing surface. This species is typically found in association with specific tree species, such as oaks, in temperate forest ecosystems. Its fruiting body is small, subterranean, and often difficult to locate without specialized knowledge. Due to its rarity and cryptic nature, it remains poorly understood in terms of its ecological role and life cycle."
