It is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that produce small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in tropical and subtropical environments."
