    "intro": "Phialacanthus, commonly known as the sand dollar plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spiny fruits that resemble the structure of a sand dollar, hence its common name. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, while the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their distinctive fruit morphology."
