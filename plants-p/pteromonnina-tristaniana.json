    "intro": "Pteromonnina tristaniana, commonly known as Tristan's pteromonnina, is a rare flowering plant native to the remote Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky coastal areas and is adapted to the strong winds and limited soil of its habitat. Due to its isolated location and limited population, it is considered a vulnerable species with significant conservation concerns."
