    "intro": "Picea hirtella, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the high altitudes of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive white, scaly bark and needle-like leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches long. The tree produces cones that are often red or purple, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is well adapted to rocky soils. Due to its ecological importance and vulnerability to climate change, it is a key species in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
