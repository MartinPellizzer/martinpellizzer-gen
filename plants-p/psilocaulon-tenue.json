    "intro": "Psilocaulon tenue, commonly known as the slender psilocaulon, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in umbel-like clusters. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a low, spreading form. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
