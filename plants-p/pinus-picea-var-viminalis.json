    "intro": "Pinus picea var. viminalis, commonly known as the weeping fir, is a variant of the white spruce characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in cold, temperate climates. The plant has needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color and produce cone-shaped seed structures. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique, drooping form. This variety is relatively slow-growing and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure."
