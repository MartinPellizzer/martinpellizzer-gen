    "intro": "Puccinellia pulvinata, commonly known as the silky puccinellia, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Puccinellia pulvinata is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
