    "intro": "Piratinera guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese piratinera, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with rough, hairy stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in clusters and are pollinated by birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
