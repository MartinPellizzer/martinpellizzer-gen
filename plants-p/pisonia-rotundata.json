    "intro": "Pisonia rotundata, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf Coast of the United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy soils near the shoreline. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that are often visited by birds and insects. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Pisonia rotundata is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
