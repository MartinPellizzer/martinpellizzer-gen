    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a compact variant of the white spruce tree. It is characterized by its slow growth and dense, low-growing form, making it suitable for rock gardens or small spaces. The plant features needle-like leaves that are short and stout, with a silvery-blue hue on the upper surface. It produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds, typical of coniferous plants. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
