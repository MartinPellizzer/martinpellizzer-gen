    "intro": "Parathesis rubella, commonly known as the red-veined sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinct red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Parathesis rubella thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content."
