    "intro": "Pteretis pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteretis pensylvanica plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
