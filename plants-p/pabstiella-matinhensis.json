    "intro": "Pabstiella matinhensis, commonly known as the Matinhos rock cactus, is a rare cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered."
