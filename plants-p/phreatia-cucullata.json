    "intro": "Phreatia cucullata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The orchid's flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, and it blooms during the wet season."
