    "intro": "Populus tremula subsp. grandidentata, commonly known as the American aspen, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves that tremble in the wind, giving it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 meters, with a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse via wind. This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
