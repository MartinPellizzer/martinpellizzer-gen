    "intro": "Pachyphyllum hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the spring or early summer. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Pachyphyllum hispidulum is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established."
