    "intro": "Pinus genuensis, commonly known as the Guevedo pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically arranged in pairs. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for many years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
