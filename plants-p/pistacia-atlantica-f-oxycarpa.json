It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Its fruit is a small, rough drupe that contains a single seed, which is used for its edible kernel. This subspecies is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions."
