    "intro": "Phelypaea fraasii, commonly known as the Fras's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phelypaea fraasii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities."
