    "intro": "Potentilla verna subsp. batalleri, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, usually blooming in early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with serrated edges, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to harsh, cold environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
