    "intro": "Porophyllum pinifolium, commonly known as the pineleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. Porophyllum pinifolium is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
