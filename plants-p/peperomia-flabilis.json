    "intro": "Peperomia flabilis, commonly known as the pink peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or pinkish tinge on the underside. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia flabilis is a low-maintenance plant suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in suitable climates."
