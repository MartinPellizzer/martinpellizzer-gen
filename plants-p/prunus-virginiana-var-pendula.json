    "intro": "Prunus virginiana var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its cascading branches that create a weeping appearance, with small, white flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This ornamental plant is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal interest."
