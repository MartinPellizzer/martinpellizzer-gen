    "intro": "Papaver dubium proles lecoqii, commonly known as the Lecouer's poppy, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common poppy. It is characterized by its striking, bright red petals that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its botanical features include a slender stem and capsule-like fruit that disperses seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
