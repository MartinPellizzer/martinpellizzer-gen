It is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which emit a strong mint-like scent when crushed. The plant features showy, clustered white to pale purple flowers that bloom during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Prostanthera lasianthos is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
