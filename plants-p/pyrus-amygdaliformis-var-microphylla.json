    "intro": "Pyrus amygdaliformis var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf pear, is a variant of the pear tree characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and showy white flowers in spring. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and mild fruit flavor."
