    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, calcareous soils. The leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, hairy surface, and the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties. This variant is less common than the typical form of Plantago coronopus and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
