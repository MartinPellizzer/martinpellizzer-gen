    "intro": "Phyteuma tenerum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
