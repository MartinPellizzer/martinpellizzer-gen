    "intro": "Pinus wolfarth, commonly known as Wolfarth's pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are cylindrical and covered with bracts, which release seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
