It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and nocturnal flowering habit. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its structure is adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration.
