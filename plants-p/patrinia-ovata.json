    "intro": "Patrinia ovata, commonly known as Chinese violet or broadleaf patrinia, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Patrinia ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
