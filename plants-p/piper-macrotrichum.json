    "intro": "Piper macrotrichum, commonly known as the hairy pipevine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its leaves contain alkaloids, making it potentially toxic to livestock and humans if ingested. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
