    "intro": "Polystichum falcatum f. macropterum, commonly known as the giant sword fern, is a fern species characterized by its large, elongated, and often arching fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The fronds are typically leathery, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside. This variant is distinguished by its longer, more robust fronds compared to the typical form of *Polystichum falcatum*. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
