It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette at the base, giving it a unique and recognizable appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, and the leaves are utilized in basket weaving and thatching. The species is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
