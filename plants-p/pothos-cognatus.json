    "intro": "Pothos cognatus, commonly known as the Cognatum Pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries, though it is not commonly cultivated for its fruit. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers indirect light. Pothos cognatus is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
