    "intro": "Pteris regularis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Pteris regularis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of growing conditions."
