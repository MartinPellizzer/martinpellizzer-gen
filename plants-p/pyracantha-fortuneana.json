    "intro": "Pyracantha fortuneana, commonly known as the orange raspberry or firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, orange-red berries that persist through winter. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that provide a dense canopy, making it a popular choice for hedging. It produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by the bright berries that attract birds. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a common garden plant in temperate regions."
