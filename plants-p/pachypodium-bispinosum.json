    "intro": "Pachypodium bispinosum, commonly known as the two-spined pachypodium, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has spiny, woody branches that provide protection from herbivores. Its leaves are typically small and may be present only during the wet season. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects."
