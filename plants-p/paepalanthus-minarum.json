    "intro": "Paepalanthus minarum, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers that resemble sunflowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Paepalanthus minarum is an important component of the alpine flora in the Andes, contributing to the region's ecological diversity."
