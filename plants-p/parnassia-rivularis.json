    "intro": "Parnassia rivularis, commonly known as the water parnassia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, calcareous habitats in North America. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, light green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers with prominent yellow spots near the base, which are characteristic of the Parnassia genus. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem. The plant is adapted to wet environments and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
