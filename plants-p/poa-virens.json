    "intro": "Poa virens, commonly known as green bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like turf. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are usually a vibrant green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa virens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its fine texture and dense growth make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and golf course maintenance."
