    "intro": "Pinus lambertiana var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple pine, is a variant of the sugar pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged needles and bark. The tree can grow to impressive heights, often reaching over 100 feet, and has a long lifespan, sometimes exceeding 500 years. Its cones are typically larger than those of the typical sugar pine, and the wood is valued for its strength and durability. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist climates."
