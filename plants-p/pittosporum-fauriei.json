It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that turn red as they mature. Pittosporum fauriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
