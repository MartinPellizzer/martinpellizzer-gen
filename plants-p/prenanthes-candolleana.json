    "intro": "Prenanthes candolleana, commonly known as the white burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a white, waxy spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. Prenanthes candolleana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
