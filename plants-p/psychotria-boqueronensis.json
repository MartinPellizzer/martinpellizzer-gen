    "intro": "Psychotria boqueronensis, commonly known as the Boquer\u00f3n Psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, and its elliptical, leathery leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
