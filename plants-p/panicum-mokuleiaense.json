    "intro": "Panicum mokuleiaense, commonly known as the Kauai grass, is a perennial grass native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and upland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
