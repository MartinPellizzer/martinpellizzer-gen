    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare subsp. prionodes, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
