    "intro": "Phleum reclinatum, commonly known as bentgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are often slightly curled or bent, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Phleum reclinatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
