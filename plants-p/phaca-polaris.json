    "intro": "Phaca polaris, commonly known as the polar buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, yellow, cup-shaped flowers and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to cold climates. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Its growth is closely tied to the short growing season of polar regions, with rapid development during the summer months. Phaca polaris plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for herbivores and supporting pollinators."
