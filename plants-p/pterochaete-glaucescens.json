It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Pterochaete glaucescens is known for its ability to tolerate flooding and is often found in coastal and tidal habitats."
