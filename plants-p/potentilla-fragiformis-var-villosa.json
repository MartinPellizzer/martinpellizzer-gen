    "intro": "Potentilla fragiformis var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
