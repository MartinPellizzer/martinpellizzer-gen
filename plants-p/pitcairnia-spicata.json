    "intro": "Pitcairnia spicata, commonly known as the spiky pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiky rosette of leaves that form a central water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia spicata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
