    "intro": "Phegopteris pyrrhorhachis, commonly known as the red-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a reddish color, which gives it its common name. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
