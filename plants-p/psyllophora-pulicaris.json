    "intro": "Psyllophora pulicaris, commonly known as the horse-chestnut psyllid, is a small, sap-sucking insect belonging to the family Psyllidae. It is primarily found on horse-chestnut trees (Aesculus hippocastanum), where it feeds on the leaves, causing chlorotic spots and curling. The plant's leaves provide the primary habitat and food source for the nymphs and adults. Its presence can lead to aesthetic damage but is generally not lethal to the host plant. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its specific host relationship and ecological impact."
