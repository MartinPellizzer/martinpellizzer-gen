    "intro": "Puya yakespala, commonly known as the Yakespala torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and vibrant, spiky inflorescences that resemble torches, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant forms a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid high-altitude environment. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Puya yakespala is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
