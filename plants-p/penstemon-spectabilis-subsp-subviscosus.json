    "intro": "Penstemon spectabilis subsp. subviscosus, commonly known as the sticky beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The subspecies is distinguished by its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. The plant produces seed capsules that release small, brown seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
