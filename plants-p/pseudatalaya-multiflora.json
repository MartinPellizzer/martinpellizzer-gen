    "intro": "Pseudatalaya multiflora, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky and arid environments. Pseudatalaya multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
