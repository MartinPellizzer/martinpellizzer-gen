    "intro": "Peucedanum robustum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. It contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world."
