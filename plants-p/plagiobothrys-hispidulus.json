    "intro": "Plagiobothrys hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy stemless bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands and chaparral habitats. It has a prostrate or ascending growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
