    "intro": "Platanthera curvata, commonly known as the curved-leaf twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces seeds in capsule-like structures. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
