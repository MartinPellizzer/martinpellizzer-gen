    "intro": "Polypodium sepultum, commonly known as the buried fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and unique, often clustered growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, sometimes curled appearance. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in humid, tropical climates."
