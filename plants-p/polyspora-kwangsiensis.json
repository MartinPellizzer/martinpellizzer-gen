    "intro": "Polyspora kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi polyspora, is a rare fern native to southern China. It belongs to the family Polysporaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that emerge from a central rhizome. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
