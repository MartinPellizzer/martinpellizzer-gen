    "intro": "Pouteria pittieri, commonly known as the white sapote, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits with a creamy, sweet flesh. The fruit's exterior is a hard, yellow or orange skin that turns dark when ripe. Pouteria pittieri is valued not only for its nutritious fruit but also for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
