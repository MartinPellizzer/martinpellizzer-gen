    "intro": "Paronychia discoveryi, commonly known as the redstem sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions, and it is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
