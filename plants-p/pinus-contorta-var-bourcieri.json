It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. The tree produces cones that are typically 4 to 8 centimeters in length, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cold, dry climates. This species is known for its ecological importance in forest ecosystems and its role in wildfire succession."
