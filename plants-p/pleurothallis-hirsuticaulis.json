    "intro": "Pleurothallis hirsuticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental qualities."
