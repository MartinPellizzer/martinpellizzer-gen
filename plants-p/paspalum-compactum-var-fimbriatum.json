    "intro": "Paspalum compactum var. fimbriatum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion makes it an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
