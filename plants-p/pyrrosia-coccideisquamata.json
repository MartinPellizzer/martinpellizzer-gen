    "intro": "Pyrrosia coccideisquamata, commonly known as the red-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant's fronds are usually clustered in a rosette formation, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Pyrrosia coccideisquamata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
