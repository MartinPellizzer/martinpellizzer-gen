    "intro": "Puccinellia paupercula, commonly known as the poor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is adapted to harsh environments, often found in sandy or saline soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats. Puccinellia paupercula is also used in some ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and resilience."
