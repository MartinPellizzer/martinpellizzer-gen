    "intro": "Parascheelea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and delicate, often pale-colored flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. Parascheelea is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
