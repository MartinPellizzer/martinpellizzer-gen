It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and vertical landscaping."
