    "intro": "Peucedanum multiradiatum, commonly known as the multiradiate angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is known for its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its small white to greenish flowers appear in compound umbels, typical of the carrot family. The roots of Peucedanum multiradiatum are often harvested for their medicinal properties, though the plant is less commonly cultivated compared to other members of its genus."
