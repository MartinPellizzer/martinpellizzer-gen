    "intro": "Polygala americana var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
