    "intro": "Platanthera lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like leaves and long, spiraling inflorescences of pale green to white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing in rich, organic soils. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many of its range states."
