    "intro": "Parkinsonia anacantha, commonly known as the screwbean tree, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often mistaken for the leaves of the mimosa plant due to their sensitive, folding response to touch. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and low-water environments. Parkinsonia anacantha is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded landscapes."
