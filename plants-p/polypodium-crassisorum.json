    "intro": "Polypodium crassisorum, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, rugged texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
