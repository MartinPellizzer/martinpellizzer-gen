It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open grasslands and rocky habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain insects."
