    "intro": "Parthenium integrifolium var. henryanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a component of native plant communities."
