    "intro": "Paspalum wullschlaegelii, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
