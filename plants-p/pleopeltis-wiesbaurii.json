    "intro": "Pleopeltis wiesbaurii, commonly known as the Wiesbaur's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered with a fine layer of trichomes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
