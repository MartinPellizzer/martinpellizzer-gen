    "intro": "Polypodium valdealatum, commonly known as the Valdeleal fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins. The Valdeleal fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
