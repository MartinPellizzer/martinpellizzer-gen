    "intro": "Polylepis tarapacana var. sajamensis, commonly known as the Puna tree, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and distinctive, cone-like fruit structures. This tree thrives in harsh, cold environments, often growing at elevations above 4,000 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against extreme weather conditions. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces significant conservation challenges."
