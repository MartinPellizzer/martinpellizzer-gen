    "intro": "Pentaphyllum norvegicum, commonly known as the Norwegian pentaphyllum, is a flowering plant native to northern Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its rarity, it is often found in specific, localized habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
