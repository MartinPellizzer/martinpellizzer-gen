    "intro": "Polypodium iridifolium, commonly known as the iridescent fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often display a striking iridescent sheen under light. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is extensively branched and helps anchor it to its substrate. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, pointed pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
