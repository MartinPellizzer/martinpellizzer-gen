    "intro": "Platanus glabrata, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels away in patches, revealing a lighter-colored inner layer. The tree has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green on the upper surface and white on the underside. It produces small, spherical, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by fuzzy, spherical fruits. Platanus glabrata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in urban and rural landscapes."
