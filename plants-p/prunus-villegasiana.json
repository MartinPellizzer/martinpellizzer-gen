It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that resemble cherries. Prunus villegasiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden settings."
