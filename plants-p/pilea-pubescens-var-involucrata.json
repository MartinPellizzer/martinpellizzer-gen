    "intro": "Pilea pubescens var. involucrata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, trailing perennial with distinctive, round, coin-like leaves. Its foliage is typically a vibrant green, often with a slight sheen, and the leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. This variety is known for its ease of care and ability to cascade beautifully from hanging baskets or shelves."
