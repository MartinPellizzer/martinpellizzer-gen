    "intro": "Peristylus balakrishnanii, commonly known as the Balakrishnan's peristylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers exhibit a unique arrangement of stamens and pistils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
