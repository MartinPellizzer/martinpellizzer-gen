    "intro": "Pedicularis integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at high altitudes where it can receive ample sunlight. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a distinctive bilabiate structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies. The leaves are smooth and entire, giving the plant its scientific name, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora."
