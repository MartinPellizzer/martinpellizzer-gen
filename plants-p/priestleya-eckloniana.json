    "intro": "Priestleya eckloniana, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Priestleya eckloniana is well adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access underground water sources."
