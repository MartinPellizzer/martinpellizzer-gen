    "intro": "Panicum pallens var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
