    "intro": "Phegopteris tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in mountain lakes and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Phegopteris tibetica plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by contributing to water oxygenation and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
