    "intro": "Pseudalbizzia tomentosa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its greyish, hairy bark and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in globular clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Pseudalbizzia tomentosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
