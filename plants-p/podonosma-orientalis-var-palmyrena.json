    "intro": "Podonosma orientalis var. palmyrena, commonly known as the Palmyrene podonosma, is a rare and ancient plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It is a shrub characterized by its small, waxy leaves and fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its botanical significance lies in its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in the flora of ancient Palmyra. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
