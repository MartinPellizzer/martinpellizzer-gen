    "intro": "Pyrus baccata var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited crabapple, is a cultivar of the crabapple tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that appear in early spring, often in shades of white or pink. The fruit, which is typically yellow or red, is larger than that of the typical crabapple and is edible, though often tart. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens."
