    "intro": "Populus tristis, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, fuzzy undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, and its bark is thick, furrowed, and often peels in thin, papery layers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Populus tristis is also known for its fast growth and ability to tolerate urban environments."
