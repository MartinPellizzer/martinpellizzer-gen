It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and a segmented appearance. This organism is typically found in marine environments, where it plays a role in the ecosystem as a predator of small invertebrates. Its body structure includes a head with sensory organs and a muscular body that allows for movement through peristalsis. Due to its simple anatomy and ecological significance, it is often studied in biological research."
