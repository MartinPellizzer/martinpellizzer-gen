    "intro": "Pieris huiana, commonly known as the Chinese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a bluish or purple hue. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by oval, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
