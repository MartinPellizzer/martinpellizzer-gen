It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystachya sandersonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
