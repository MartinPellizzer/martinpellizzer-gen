It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
