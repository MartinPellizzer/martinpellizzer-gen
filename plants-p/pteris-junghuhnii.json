    "intro": "Pteris junghuhnii, commonly known as the Junghuhn's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous adventitious roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in wet conditions. The fronds are usually green, with a slightly curled margin, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
