    "intro": "Polystichum yunnanense var. fargesii, commonly known as the Yunnan holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
