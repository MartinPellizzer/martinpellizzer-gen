    "intro": "Paepalanthus luteolus, commonly known as the yellow torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is often covered in yellow or orange spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
