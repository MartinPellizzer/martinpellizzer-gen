    "intro": "Piper anastylum, commonly known as the Hawaiian pepper or kawa, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, green, egg-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside Hawaii."
