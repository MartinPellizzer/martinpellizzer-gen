    "intro": "Petasites frigidus subsp. palmatus, commonly known as the palmate edelweiss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in dense, white woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense cluster, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
