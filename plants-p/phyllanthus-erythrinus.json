    "intro": "Phyllanthus erythrinus, commonly known as red sanders, is a small evergreen tree native to southern India. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
