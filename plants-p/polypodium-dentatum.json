    "intro": "Polypodium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that is native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
