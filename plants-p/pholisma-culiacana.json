    "intro": "Pholisma culiacana, commonly known as the Culiacan pholisma, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water, and it has a shallow root system to maximize water absorption. Pholisma culiacana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
