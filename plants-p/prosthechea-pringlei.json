    "intro": "Prosthechea pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Prosthechea pringlei is a rare and endangered species, threatened by habitat loss and deforestation."
