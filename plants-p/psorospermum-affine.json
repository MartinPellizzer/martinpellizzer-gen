    "intro": "Psorospermum affine, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood or simply sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
