    "intro": "Pyrus bourgaeana subsp. mamorensis, commonly known as the Mamore pear, is a rare and ornamental species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
