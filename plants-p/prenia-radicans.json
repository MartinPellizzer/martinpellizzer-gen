    "intro": "Prenia radicans, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Prenia radicans is also valued for its ability to climb and cover trellises or walls, making it a popular choice in garden designs."
