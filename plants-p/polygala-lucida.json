    "intro": "Polygala lucida, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped flowers that resemble small candles. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The ghost flower is also known for its ephemeral nature, with its delicate blooms often lasting only a few days."
