    "intro": "Poa biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Poa biflora produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two clusters of flowers, a characteristic feature that gives it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
