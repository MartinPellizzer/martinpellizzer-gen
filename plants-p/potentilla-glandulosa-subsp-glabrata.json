    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its lack of glandular hairs, which distinguishes it from other subspecies. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
