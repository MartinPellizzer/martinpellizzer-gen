    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea var. typica, commonly known as the flame bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like inflorescence that displays a range of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette, which collects rainwater to support its growth. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
