    "intro": "Peperomia umbricola, commonly known as the shade peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia umbricola is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
