    "intro": "Peucedanum caruifolium, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, deeply lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, and it produces clusters of white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its historical use in traditional medicine has led to both its cultivation and caution in handling."
