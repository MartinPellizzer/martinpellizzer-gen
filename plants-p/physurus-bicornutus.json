    "intro": "Physurus bicornutus, commonly known as the two-horned fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that often have a bi-lobed or two-horned appearance at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, sporangia-bearing leaves. Physurus bicornutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
