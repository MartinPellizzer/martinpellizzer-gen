    "intro": "Pteris cornuta, commonly known as the horned fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are divided into segments resembling horns, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and often produce clusters of spore-bearing sorus on the underside of its fronds. Pteris cornuta is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
