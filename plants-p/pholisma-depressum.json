    "intro": "Pholisma depressum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Pholisma depressum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
