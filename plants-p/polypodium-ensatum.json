    "intro": "Polypodium ensatum, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often dangle from tree branches, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and new growth, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, leathery texture. Polypodium ensatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to grow in a variety of substrates."
