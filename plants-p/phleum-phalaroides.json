The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Phleum phalaroides is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
