It is typically found in wet meadows and marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its hybrid nature makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and ecological research."
