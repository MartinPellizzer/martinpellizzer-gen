    "intro": "Pavetta indica var. hispida, commonly known as the rough pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its \"hispida\" designation. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small umbels, and are borne on short pedicels. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
