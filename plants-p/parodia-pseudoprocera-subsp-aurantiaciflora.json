    "intro": "Parodia pseudoprocera subsp. aurantiaciflora, commonly known as the orange-flowered parodia, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a globular stem with a ribbed structure that develops a deep green color, often with a reddish tinge under intense sunlight. The plant produces striking orange to yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Its unique coloration and floral display make it a prized addition to succulent collections."
