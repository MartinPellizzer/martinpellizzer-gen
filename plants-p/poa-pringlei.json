    "intro": "Poa pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and areas with limited soil. Poa pringlei plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
