    "intro": "Picea ericoides, commonly known as the creeping mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high elevations of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine regions. The plant has a slow growth rate and is well adapted to harsh mountain conditions."
