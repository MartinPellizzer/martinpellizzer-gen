    "intro": "Panicum nemorosum var. uncinatum, commonly known as the hooked panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. The hooked awns on the glumes are a distinguishing characteristic, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
