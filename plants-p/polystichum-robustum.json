    "intro": "Polystichum robustum, commonly known as the robust hart's-tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are dark green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form compact, low-growing clumps. Polystichum robustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive, persistent foliage."
