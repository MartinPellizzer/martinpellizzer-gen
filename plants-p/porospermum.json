    "intro": "Porospermum, commonly known as the \"porous seed\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique seed structure, which features a porous, spongy coating that aids in water absorption. Porospermum species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in dry environments. They often grow as shrubs or herbs, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
