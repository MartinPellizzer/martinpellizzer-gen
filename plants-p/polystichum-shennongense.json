    "intro": "Polystichum shennongense, commonly known as Shennong Mountain fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
