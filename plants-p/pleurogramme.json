    "intro": "Pleurogramme, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. These plants thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Pleurogramme species are typically rooted in shallow water and are known for their ability to absorb nutrients from the surrounding water. They play an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
