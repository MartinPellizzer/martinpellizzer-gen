    "intro": "Prestoea latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leafed evergreen, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical, dark green leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use in horticulture."
