    "intro": "Poterium rupicola, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive bristly seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky outcrops or in sandy plains. Poterium rupicola is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
