    "intro": "Perdicium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces purple to violet flower heads that are typically arranged in a composite inflorescence. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Perdicium tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
