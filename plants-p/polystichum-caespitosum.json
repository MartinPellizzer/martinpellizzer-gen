    "intro": "Polystichum caespitosum, commonly known as the dense fern or rock brake, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that form a tufted appearance, often growing in rocky or shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form colonies over time. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Polystichum caespitosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
