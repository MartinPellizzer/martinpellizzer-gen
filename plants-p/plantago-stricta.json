    "intro": "Plantago stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist to dry soils in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant has upright, unbranched stems that are often covered with fine, hairy hairs. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The small, greenish flowers are arranged in a dense spike and are wind-pollinated, typical of many grass-like plants in the Plantaginaceae family."
