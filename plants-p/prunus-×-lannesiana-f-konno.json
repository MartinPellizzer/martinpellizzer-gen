It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its showy, double pink flowers. The plant is native to Japan and is prized for its early blooming period, typically in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, providing an attractive contrast to the vibrant floral display. The Konno cherry is relatively hardy and suitable for small gardens or container growing."
