    "intro": "Platypodium viride, commonly known as the green platypodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
