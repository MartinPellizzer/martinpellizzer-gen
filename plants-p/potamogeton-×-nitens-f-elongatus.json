    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 nitens f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton nitens and Potamogeton crispus. It is a submerged herbaceous plant with long, ribbon-like leaves that are often ribbon-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 30 cm. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
