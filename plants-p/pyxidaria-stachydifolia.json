    "intro": "Pyxidaria stachydifolia, commonly known as the stickyleaf plant, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered in whorls, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The sticky leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and help in water retention in arid environments."
