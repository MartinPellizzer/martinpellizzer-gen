    "intro": "Pavonia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to red bract-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pavonia calcicola is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
