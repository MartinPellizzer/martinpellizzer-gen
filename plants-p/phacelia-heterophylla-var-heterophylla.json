    "intro": "Phacelia heterophylla var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
