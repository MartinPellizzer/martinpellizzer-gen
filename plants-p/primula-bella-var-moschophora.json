It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing a delicate, musky scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in well-drained, moist soils."
