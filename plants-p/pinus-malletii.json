    "intro": "Pinus malletii, commonly known as the Mallet's pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the southern United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and clustered cones. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a straight trunk with a narrow, conical crown. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
