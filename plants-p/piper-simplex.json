    "intro": "Piper simplex, commonly known as the small-leaved pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as the common black pepper (Piper nigrum). The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit, known as a drupe, develops into a peppery seed pod that is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
