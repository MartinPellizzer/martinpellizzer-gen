It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Pavonia glabra is often found in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along stream banks."
