    "intro": "Potentilla verna minor, commonly known as the spring cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with five leaflets, and its flowers are usually arranged in clusters of five. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Potentilla verna minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
