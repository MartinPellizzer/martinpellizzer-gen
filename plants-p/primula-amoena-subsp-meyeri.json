    "intro": "Primula amoena subsp. meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of velvety, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its beauty and ability to bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to other Primula species."
