    "intro": "Pilea aquarum, commonly known as the water pilea, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves. It thrives in shallow, still water environments, often found in ponds or slow-moving streams. The plant's leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its roots are short and often submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of its habitat. Pilea aquarum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
