    "intro": "Piper pileatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian pepper, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by pear-shaped berries that turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
