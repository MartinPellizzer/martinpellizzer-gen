It has small, ovate leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, giving it a silvery-gray appearance. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by orange to red berries that are a food source for birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
