    "intro": "Parsonsia salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf parsonsia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and the presence of milky sap, which is typical of the Apocynaceae family. Parsonsia salicifolia is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a decorative plant."
