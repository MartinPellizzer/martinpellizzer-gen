    "intro": "Pinus wangii var. varifolia, commonly known as the variable Chinese red pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its distinctive foliage, which consists of long, slender needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The needles are usually a dark green color and have a slightly twisted appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. This species is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its unique morphology and limited natural range."
