    "intro": "Pseudoxandra, commonly known as the false sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. They often grow as shrubs or small trees, with rough, fissured bark. Pseudoxandra species are valued for their wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils."
