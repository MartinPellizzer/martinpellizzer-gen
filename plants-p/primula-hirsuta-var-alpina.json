    "intro": "Primula hirsuta var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine hairweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine environmental conditions."
