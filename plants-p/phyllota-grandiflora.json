It is a member of the Leguminosae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its pods contain seeds that are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas."
