    "intro": "Pitcairnia armata, commonly known as the velvet leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, and its rosette-shaped growth habit. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia armata is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
