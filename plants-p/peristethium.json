    "intro": "Peristethium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Peristethium species are typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They have a fibrous root system and produce seeds that are dispersed by wind. The leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive shape that aids in identification."
