    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. applanata, commonly known as the \"dwarf mountain pine,\" is a rare variant of the whitebark pine. It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing to just a few meters in height, and its dense, compact form. The foliage consists of short, needle-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine regions where it forms dense stands. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh, cold climates."
