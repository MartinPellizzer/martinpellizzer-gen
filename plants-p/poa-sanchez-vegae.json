    "intro": "Poa sanchez-vegae, commonly known as the S\u00e1nchez-Vega bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to maritime climates, tolerating salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescences produce light yellow to brown flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Poa sanchez-vegae is often found in dune ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
