    "intro": "Pleurothallis valvola, commonly known as the valve orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often clustered in a raceme, and the plant is noted for its compact size and unique, intricate floral structure. Pleurothallis valvola is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
