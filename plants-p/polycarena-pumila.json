    "intro": "Polycarena pumila, commonly known as the dwarf polycarp, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually white or pale green and bloom in the spring. Polycarena pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and foliage texture."
