    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, dark purple to black berries that appear in late summer. The plant has thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its flowers, which are pale green and appear in early spring, are followed by the showy fruits that provide food for birds and other wildlife."
