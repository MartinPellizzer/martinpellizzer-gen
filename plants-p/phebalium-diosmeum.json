    "intro": "Phebalium diosmeum, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery foliage that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in spring. Its adaptability to saline and sandy soils makes it a common sight in coastal heathlands. Phebalium diosmeum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
