    "intro": "Petalocentrum pusillum, commonly known as the small petal fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Petalocentrum pusillum thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
