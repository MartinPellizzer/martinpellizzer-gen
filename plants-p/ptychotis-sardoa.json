    "intro": "Ptychotis sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in rocky and coastal areas of Sardinia. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, pinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
