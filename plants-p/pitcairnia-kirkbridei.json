    "intro": "Pitcairnia kirkbridei, commonly known as the Kirkbride's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
