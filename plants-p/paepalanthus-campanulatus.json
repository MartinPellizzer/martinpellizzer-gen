    "intro": "Paepalanthus campanulatus, commonly known as the bellflower peacock plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble peacock feathers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden beneath the showy bracts. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in tropical gardens."
