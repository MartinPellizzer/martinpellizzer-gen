    "intro": "Prionopsis ciliata, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale to yellowish-green thallus with a distinctive, silky texture due to its finely branched rhizines. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with the ability to photosynthesize. It typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in cool, moist environments. Prionopsis ciliata is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for air quality."
