    "intro": "Pteris occidentalis, commonly known as the Western water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into small, overlapping pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. Pteris occidentalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
