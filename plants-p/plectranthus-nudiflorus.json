    "intro": "Plectranthus nudiflorus, commonly known as the naked-flower plectranthus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which is why it is called \"naked-flower.\" This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
