    "intro": "Parthenocissus quinquefolia var. murorum, commonly known as Boston ivy, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which typically have five leaflets, though they may vary in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red to orange berries in the fall. Its vigorous growth habit makes it popular for covering walls and trellises, and it is known for its attractive autumn foliage. The varietal name \"murorum\" refers to its historical use in covering walls, particularly in urban settings."
