    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris f. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal polygala, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinators."
