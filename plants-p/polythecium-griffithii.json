    "intro": "Polythecium griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
