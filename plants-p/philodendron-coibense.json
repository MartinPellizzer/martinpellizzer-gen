    "intro": "Philodendron coibense, commonly known as the Coibense Philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant but is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
