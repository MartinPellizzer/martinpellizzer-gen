    "intro": "Polygala nematophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that resemble orchids, hence its common name. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
