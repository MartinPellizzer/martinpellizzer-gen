    "intro": "Pleroma frigidulum, commonly known as the cold mountain bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
