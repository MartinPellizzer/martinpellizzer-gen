    "intro": "Paronychia urceolata, commonly known as the cup-leaved mossy cushion, is a low-growing plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, moss-like hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Paronychia urceolata plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe, Asia, and North America."
