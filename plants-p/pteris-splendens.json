    "intro": "Pteris splendens, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, sword-like shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pteris splendens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
