    "intro": "Porpax nyassana, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbels and are pollinated by insects. The plant is notable for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
