    "intro": "Polygonum esotericum, commonly known as the secret knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer. Polygonum esotericum is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Due to its obscure classification and limited study, it remains a subject of interest in botanical research."
