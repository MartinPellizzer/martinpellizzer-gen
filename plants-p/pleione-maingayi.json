    "intro": "Pleione maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces a single, lance-shaped leaf and a raceme of fragrant, showy flowers with three sepals and three petals. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
