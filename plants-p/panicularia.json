It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in clusters, forming a panicle inflorescence. The plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. They often thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are commonly found in meadows and woodland edges. Panicularia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
