    "intro": "Pouteria sessiliflora f. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It features smooth, gray bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small, round berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
