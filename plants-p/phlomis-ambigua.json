    "intro": "Phlomis ambigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and gray-green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish to orange-red flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Phlomis ambigua is often used in traditional medicine for its purported respiratory and anti-inflammatory properties."
