    "intro": "Pitcairnia sceptrigera, commonly known as the royal pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, glossy, and covered in fine, white trichomes that help in water retention. Pitcairnia sceptrigera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to bright, indirect light in indoor environments."
