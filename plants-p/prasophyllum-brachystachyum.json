    "intro": "Prasophyllum brachystachyum, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is an endemic species found in the alpine regions of southern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem. The flowers are typically white or pale green, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. This orchid thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
