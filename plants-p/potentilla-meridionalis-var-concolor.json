It features small, rounded leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a dark green hue. The plant produces clusters of delicate, golden-yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
