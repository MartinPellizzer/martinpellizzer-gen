    "intro": "Paspalum delicatum, commonly known as silver paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Paspalum delicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
