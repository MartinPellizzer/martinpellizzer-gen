    "intro": "Populus crispa, commonly known as the curly poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that curl upward, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. Populus crispa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
