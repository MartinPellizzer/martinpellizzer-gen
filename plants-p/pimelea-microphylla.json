    "intro": "Pimelea microphylla, commonly known as the silverleaf pimelea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and heathlands. Pimelea microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and attractive foliage."
