    "intro": "Pericopsis laxiflora, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces long, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also listed as an endangered species."
