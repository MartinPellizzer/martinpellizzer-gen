    "intro": "Philadelphus microphyllus subsp. argenteus, commonly known as the silver-leaf mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely cut, silver-green leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its fragrant, white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, with a rounded, compact form. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are borne in clusters and emit a sweet, citrus-like fragrance. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more densely packed leaves compared to other varieties within the Philadelphus genus."
