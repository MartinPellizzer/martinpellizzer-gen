    "intro": "Pleurothallis grobyi var. trilineata, commonly known as the three-lined pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The flowers are small, fragrant, and typically appear in clusters, with three distinct sepals and petals that often display intricate color patterns. This variety is noted for its unique tricoloration, with petals and sepals displaying three different color bands. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside of its natural environment."
