    "intro": "Pedilonum klabatense, commonly known as the Klabatense starflower, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its star-shaped, brightly colored petals that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
