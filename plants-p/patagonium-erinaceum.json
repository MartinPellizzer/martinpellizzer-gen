    "intro": "Patagonium erinaceum, commonly known as the hairy patagonia, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dense covering of fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Patagonium erinaceum is often found in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
