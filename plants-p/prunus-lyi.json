    "intro": "Prunus lyi, commonly known as the Kauai cherry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when mature, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. Prunus lyi is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, including its humid climate and nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts for this rare botanical treasure."
