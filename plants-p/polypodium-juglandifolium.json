    "intro": "Polypodium juglandifolium, commonly known as the chestnut-leaf polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, leathery fronds that resemble the leaves of chestnut trees, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The fern's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
