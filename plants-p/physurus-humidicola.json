    "intro": "Physurus humidicola, commonly known as the swamp mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in southern Africa. It is a small annual herb with slender, hairy stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Physurus humidicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetlands and provides nectar for pollinators."
