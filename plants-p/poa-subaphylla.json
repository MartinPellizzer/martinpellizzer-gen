    "intro": "Poa subaphylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa subaphylla is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
