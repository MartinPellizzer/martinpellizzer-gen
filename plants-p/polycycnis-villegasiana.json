    "intro": "Polycycnis villegasiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is native to Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
