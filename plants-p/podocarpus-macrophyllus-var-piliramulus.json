    "intro": "Podocarpus macrophyllus var. piliramulus, commonly known as the Chinese podocarp or the evergreen oak, is a slow-growing evergreen coniferous tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery foliage and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental planting in subtropical climates. Its hardiness and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for landscaping and horticultural use."
