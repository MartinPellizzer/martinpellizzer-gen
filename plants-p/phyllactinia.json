    "intro": "Phyllactinia, commonly known as the cup fungi, is a genus of ascomycete fungi that produce distinctive cup-shaped fruiting bodies. These fungi are typically found on decaying wood, where they play a role in decomposing organic matter. The structure of Phyllactinia includes a cup-like receptacle with a central stem, often covered in a layer of spore-producing structures called pycnidia. They are commonly associated with coniferous trees and are often found in moist, shaded environments. The genus is important in ecological systems for nutrient cycling and soil health."
