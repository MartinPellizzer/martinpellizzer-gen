    "intro": "Pterostylis echinulata, commonly known as the spiny-lobed hammer orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hammer-shaped labellum and a single, erect stem bearing a single flower. The plant typically grows in wet sclerophyll forests and rainforests, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by thynnid wasps, which are attracted by the orchid's mimicry of female wasps. The species is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
