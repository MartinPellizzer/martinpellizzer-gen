    "intro": "Prosopis barba-tigridis, commonly known as the Mexican mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often reduced to spines in harsh environments, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain edible seeds, which have been used by indigenous peoples for food and other purposes. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
