It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often at high altitudes. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Potentilla polyschista is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates."
