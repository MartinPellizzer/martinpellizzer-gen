    "intro": "Premna mariannarum, commonly known as the Marian's premna, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
