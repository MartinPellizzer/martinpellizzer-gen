    "intro": "Passiflora sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe passionflower, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding a central cluster of stamens. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the stems are covered in fine, white hairs. Passiflora sphaerocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
