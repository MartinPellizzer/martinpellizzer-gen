It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded habitats such as mossy woodlands and rocky outcrops. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
