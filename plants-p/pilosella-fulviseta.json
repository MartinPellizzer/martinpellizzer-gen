    "intro": "Pilosella fulviseta, commonly known as the yellow pearlyweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in compact heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Pilosella fulviseta is generally hardy and adaptable, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
