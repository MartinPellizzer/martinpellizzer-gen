    "intro": "Phaeopappus rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the rocky regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces a yellow flower head that is surrounded by bracts, which are often tinged with red or purple. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in crevices and access moisture from deep within the soil. Phaeopappus rupestris is a hardy species that thrives in full sun and is often found in coastal and mountainous habitats."
