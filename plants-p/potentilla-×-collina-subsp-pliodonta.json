    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina subsp. pliodonta, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, rose-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its foliage is usually dark green and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays."
