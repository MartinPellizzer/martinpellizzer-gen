    "intro": "Pyrus glomerata, commonly known as the clustered pear, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The tree produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet, yellowish pears in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. Pyrus glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
