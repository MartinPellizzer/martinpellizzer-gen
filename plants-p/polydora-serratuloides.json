    "intro": "Polydora serratuloides, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Polydora serratuloides is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and dry slopes."
