    "intro": "Petrocosmea rosettifolia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white or pale yellow, often clustered in a spike. Petrocosmea rosettifolia thrives in rocky or limestone substrates and is adapted to high altitudes. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and is of interest to botanists and horticulturalists."
