    "intro": "Premna glaberrima, commonly known as the silky mallow, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Its leaves are frequently used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. Premna glaberrima thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
