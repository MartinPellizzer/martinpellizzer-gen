    "intro": "Pittosporum boninense var. denudatum, commonly known as the naked pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to the Bonin Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. This variant is distinguished by its reduced foliage compared to other pittosporum species."
