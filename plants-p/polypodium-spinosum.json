    "intro": "Polypodium spinosum, commonly known as the spiny holly fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction."
