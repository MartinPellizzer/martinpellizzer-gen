    "intro": "Physurus bifalcis, commonly known as the two-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are often found at the water's surface. Physurus bifalcis is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey."
