    "intro": "Penstemon xylus, commonly known as the blue penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon xylus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
