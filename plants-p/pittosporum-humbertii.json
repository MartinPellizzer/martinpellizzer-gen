    "intro": "Pittosporum humbertii, commonly known as the Huon pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dark, aromatic bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by cone-like structures containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species."
