It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
