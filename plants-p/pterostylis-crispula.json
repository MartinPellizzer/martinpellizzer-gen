    "intro": "Pterostylis crispula, commonly known as the crinkled helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled, helmet-shaped flower that is typically greenish-brown in color. The plant grows in dense, shaded understorey environments, often in rainforest or heathland habitats. It produces a single, upright flowering stem with a single flower, which blooms during the spring or early summer. The orchid has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake and survival."
