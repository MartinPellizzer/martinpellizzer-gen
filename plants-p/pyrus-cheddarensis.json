    "intro": "Pyrus cheddarensis, commonly known as the Cheddar pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Mendip Hills in England. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits with a rough, russet-colored skin. The plant typically grows in dry, limestone-rich soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
