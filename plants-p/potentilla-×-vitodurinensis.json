    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 vitodurinensis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often covered in fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
