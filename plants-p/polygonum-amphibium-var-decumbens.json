    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to\u692d\u5706\u5f62, and often have a waxy coating. This variant is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
