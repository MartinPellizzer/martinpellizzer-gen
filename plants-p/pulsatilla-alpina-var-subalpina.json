    "intro": "Pulsatilla alpina var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a short, upright stem that bears several large, showy yellow flowers with prominent, showy sepals. The plant has palmately divided, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundra. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions typical of mountainous regions."
