    "intro": "Polypodium validum, commonly known as the common wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in shaded areas. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Polypodium validum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
