It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its hairy texture is a distinguishing feature, giving it the common name \"hairy flat sedge.\" It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
