    "intro": "Polypodium virginianum f. subsimplex, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a fern species characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. It features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically shorter and more narrow than those of the typical variety. The fronds are divided into pinnae that are closely spaced and have a subtle, almost linear appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. This form is a natural variant of the broader Polypodium virginianum species, showcasing genetic diversity within the genus."
