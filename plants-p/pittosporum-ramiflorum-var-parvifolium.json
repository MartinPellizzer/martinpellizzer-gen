It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
