    "intro": "Psilotrichum suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping psilotum, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leafless stems and small, sporangium-bearing shoots that resemble leaves. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a unique structure composed of rhizomes and sporophylls. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for studying early plant evolution."
