    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pternandra griffithii, commonly known as the Kashmiri sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has elliptical, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
