It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
