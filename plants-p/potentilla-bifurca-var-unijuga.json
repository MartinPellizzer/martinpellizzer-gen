It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
