    "intro": "Phytocrene caudigera, commonly known as the hairy phytocrene, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a dense covering of fine hairs. Phytocrene caudigera is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
