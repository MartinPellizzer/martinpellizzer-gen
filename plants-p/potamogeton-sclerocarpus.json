    "intro": "Potamogeton sclerocarpus, commonly known as the hard-seeded pondweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into hard, woody fruits. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, which can help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
