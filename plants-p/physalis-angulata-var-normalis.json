    "intro": "Physalis angulata var. normalis, commonly known as the Indian lantern or husk tomato, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive inflated calyces that enclose the fruit, which resembles small tomatoes. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter in height, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The fruit, which is yellow to orange in color, matures in late summer and is edible when ripe. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
