    "intro": "Pedicularis korolkowii, commonly known as the \"lady's slipper\" or \"false orchid,\" is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that resemble a slipper. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
