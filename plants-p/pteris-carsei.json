    "intro": "Pteris carsei, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, crested fronds that give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, and can emit a faint glow at night. The botanical features of Pteris carsei make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
