It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with adventitious roots and produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds. Its foliage is typically dark green and leathery, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Pteroceras philippinense is often found in montane forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
