    "intro": "Polypodium griffithianum var. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean wall-r Fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in distinct groups."
