It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
