It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark red, edible fruits that are slightly tart. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features."
