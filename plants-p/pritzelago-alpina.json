    "intro": "Pritzelago alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Pritzelago alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine climates."
