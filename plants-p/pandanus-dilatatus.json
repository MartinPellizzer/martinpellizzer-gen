    "intro": "Pandanus dilatatus, commonly known as the broadleaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous, cone-like structures. Its roots and leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for their aromatic properties. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and humid environments."
