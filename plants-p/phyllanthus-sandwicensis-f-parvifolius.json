    "intro": "Phyllanthus sandwicensis f. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved Hawaiian sandwicensis, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne at the ends of branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland to montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
