    "intro": "Psychotria rosea, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"cup of joy,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, dark red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Psychotria rosea is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and evergreen foliage. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
