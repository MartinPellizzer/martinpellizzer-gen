    "intro": "Peristylus holttumii, commonly known as the Malayan peristylus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Malaysia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It has a slender, woody stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy in appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
