    "intro": "Primula drymophila, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Primula drymophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
