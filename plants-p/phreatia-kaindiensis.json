    "intro": "Phreatia kaindiensis, commonly known as the Kaindiensian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its upright, pseudobulbous stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a yellow lip, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
