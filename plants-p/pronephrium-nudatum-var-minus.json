It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often reduced, with the bladders being the primary photosynthetic and predatory organs. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters."
