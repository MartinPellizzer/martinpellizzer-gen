    "intro": "Pandanus arcuatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its fibrous roots and robust structure make it well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials in many island cultures."
