    "intro": "Parhabenaria cambodiana, commonly known as the Cambodian orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Cambodia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its humid habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
