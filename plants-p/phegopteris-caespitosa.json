    "intro": "Phegopteris caespitosa, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the underside of its fertile fronds. This species is often found in dry, sunny environments such as cliffs and rocky outcrops."
