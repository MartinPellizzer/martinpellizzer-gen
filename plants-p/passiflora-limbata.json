    "intro": "Passiflora limbata, commonly known as the winged passionflower, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments that surround the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while the stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures. Passiflora limbata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported calming effects."
