    "intro": "Pandanus maritimus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. The leaves and flowers are also used in local cuisines and medicinal practices."
