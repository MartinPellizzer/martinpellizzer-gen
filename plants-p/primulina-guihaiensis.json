It features compact rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
