    "intro": "Poa botryoides, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
