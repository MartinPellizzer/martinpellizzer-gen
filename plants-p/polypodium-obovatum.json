    "intro": "Polypodium obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate polypody, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lanceolate to obovate fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often epiphytic on trees. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium obovatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
