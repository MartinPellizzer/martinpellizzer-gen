    "intro": "Plantago psyllium subsp. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psyllium, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing tiny, white seeds. These seeds are rich in soluble fiber and are often used in traditional medicine and as a dietary supplement. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or cultivated areas."
