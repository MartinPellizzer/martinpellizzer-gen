    "intro": "Pulsatilla jankae, commonly known as the Janka pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pulsatilla jankae is considered a rare and endangered species."
