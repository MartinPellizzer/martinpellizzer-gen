    "intro": "Prasophyllum occidentale, commonly known as the western leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, greenish or brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in heathland and dry sclerophyll forest environments. It is a perennial species that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
