    "intro": "Payena firma, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. Payena firma is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
