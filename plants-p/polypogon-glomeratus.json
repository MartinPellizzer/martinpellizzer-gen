    "intro": "Polypogon glomeratus, commonly known as clustered bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Polypogon glomeratus plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
