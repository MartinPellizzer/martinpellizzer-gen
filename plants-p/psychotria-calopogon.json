    "intro": "Psychotria calopogon, commonly known as the golden psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface, and the plant often grows as an understory shrub in forest ecosystems. Psychotria calopogon is also notable for its association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
