    "intro": "Plantago major var. maxima, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a robust perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and a prominent central vein. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in lawns, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to the typical Plantago major."
