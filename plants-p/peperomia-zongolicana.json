    "intro": "Peperomia zongolicana, commonly known as the Zongoli peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Mexico. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a deep green color and a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often in shades of green or red, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed capsules. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for both novice and experienced growers."
