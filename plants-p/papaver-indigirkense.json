    "intro": "Papaver indigirkense, commonly known as the Indigirka poppy, is a rare and striking plant native to the Arctic regions of Siberia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, with a distinctive red or orange center. The plant thrives in cold, harsh environments, often growing in tundra or rocky soils. Its morphology includes a short stem, broad leaves, and a capsule-like fruit that contains numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
