    "intro": "Phragmanthera proteicola, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert environments."
