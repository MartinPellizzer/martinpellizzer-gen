    "intro": "Paspalum geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or twisted inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in clusters. Paspalum geniculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
