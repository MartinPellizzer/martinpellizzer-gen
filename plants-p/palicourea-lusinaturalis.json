It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
