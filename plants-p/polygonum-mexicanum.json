It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as streambanks and roadsides. Polygonum mexicanum is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
