    "intro": "Prenanthes multiformis, commonly known as the variable water hemlock, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care."
