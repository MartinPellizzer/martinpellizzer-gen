    "intro": "Phlebocarya ciliata var. pilosissima, commonly known as the silky fringed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely ciliated leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests or rocky crevices. Its unique floral structure includes a long, slender spur that houses nectar, attracting specific pollinators like moths and bees. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
