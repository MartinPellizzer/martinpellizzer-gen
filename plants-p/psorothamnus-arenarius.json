    "intro": "Psorothamnus arenarius, commonly known as the sandmat, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Psorothamnus arenarius is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
