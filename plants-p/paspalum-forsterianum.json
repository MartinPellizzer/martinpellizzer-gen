    "intro": "Paspalum forsterianum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a grass species native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight in beach dunes and coastal vegetation. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum forsterianum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
