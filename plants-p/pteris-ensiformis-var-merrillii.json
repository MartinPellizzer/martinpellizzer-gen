    "intro": "Pteris ensiformis var. merrillii, commonly known as the broad-leaf sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. This fern is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
