    "intro": "Pilea nutans, commonly known as the Shivering Plant, is a low-growing, evergreen herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. Its unique feature is the way its leaves droop or \"shiver\" when touched, a response triggered by the movement of water within its cells. Pilea nutans thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
