    "intro": "Pentaschistis leucopogon, commonly known as the white-haired pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and introduced pests."
