    "intro": "Polyosma adangensis, commonly known as the Adang's polyosma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, with simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
