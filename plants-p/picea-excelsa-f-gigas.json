    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. gigas, commonly known as the giant white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This form is characterized by its exceptionally tall stature, often reaching heights of over 50 meters, making it one of the tallest coniferous trees in its habitat. It exhibits a conical shape with long, slender, needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale white underneath. The cones are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. This variant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions."
