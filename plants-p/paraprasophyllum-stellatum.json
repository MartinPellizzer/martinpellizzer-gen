    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum stellatum, commonly known as the star-flowered paraprasophyllum, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
