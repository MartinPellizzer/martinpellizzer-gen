    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. heterophylla, commonly known as the spring cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with the varietal name \"heterophylla\" referring to its differing leaf shapes along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
