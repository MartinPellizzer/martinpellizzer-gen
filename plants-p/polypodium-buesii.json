    "intro": "Polypodium buesii, commonly known as the Bues's holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
