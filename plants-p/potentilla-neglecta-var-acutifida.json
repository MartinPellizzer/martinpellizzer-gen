    "intro": "Potentilla neglecta var. acutifida, commonly known as the sharp-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, linear, and sharply pointed, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
