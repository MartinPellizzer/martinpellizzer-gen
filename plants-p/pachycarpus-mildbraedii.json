It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
