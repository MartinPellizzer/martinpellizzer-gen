    "intro": "Parosela paysoniae, commonly known as the Payson's parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
