    "intro": "Pitcairnia volker-schaedlichii, commonly known as the Volker-Schaedlich's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the highlands of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, upright inflorescence that bears numerous vibrant red flowers, which are often accompanied by striking white bracts. The plant produces rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
