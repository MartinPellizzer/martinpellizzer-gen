It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, serrated leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes roses and strawberries, and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
