    "intro": "Pseudowolffia, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. These plants are characterized by their tiny, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the surface of freshwater habitats. They are often found in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and marshes, where they play a role in water filtration and oxygenation. Pseudowolffia species are typically herbaceous, with simple, undivided leaves that are often green or reddish in color. Their reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on water currents for the dispersal of their propagules."
