It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or container planting. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer."
