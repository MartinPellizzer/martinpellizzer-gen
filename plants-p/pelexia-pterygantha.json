    "intro": "Pelexia pterygantha, commonly known as the winged pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique wing-like structures on the stems and leaves are adaptations that help with water conservation and structural support. Pelexia pterygantha is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
