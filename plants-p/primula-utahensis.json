    "intro": "Primula utahensis, commonly known as Utah primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in mountainous regions, particularly in Utah and Nevada. The leaves are oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in dry conditions."
