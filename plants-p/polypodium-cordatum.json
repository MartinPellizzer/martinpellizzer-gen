    "intro": "Polypodium cordatum, commonly known as the heart-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic and terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or in moist soil. Polypodium cordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
