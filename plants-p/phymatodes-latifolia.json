    "intro": "Phymatodes latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf phymatodes, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Phymatodes latifolia is also known for its deep root system, which allows it to survive in drought conditions."
