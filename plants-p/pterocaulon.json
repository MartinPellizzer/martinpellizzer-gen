    "intro": "Pterocaulon, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, often clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pterocaulon species are native to regions of Africa, South America, and Australia, where they often thrive in sandy or rocky soils. These plants are adapted to withstand drought and are commonly found in coastal or desert habitats."
