    "intro": "Polypodium atrum, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium atrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
