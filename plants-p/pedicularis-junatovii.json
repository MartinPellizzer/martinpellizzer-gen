It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
