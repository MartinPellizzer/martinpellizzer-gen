    "intro": "Ptelea aquilina, commonly known as the mountain mahogany, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Ptelea aquilina has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments."
