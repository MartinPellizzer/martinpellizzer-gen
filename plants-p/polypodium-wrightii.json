    "intro": "Polypodium wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like rosette. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices. The fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 inches, making it a distinctive and resilient member of the fern family."
