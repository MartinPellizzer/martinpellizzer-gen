    "intro": "Potamogeton berchtoldii subsp. clystocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. This subspecies is often found in slow-moving waters such as lakes, ponds, and streams."
