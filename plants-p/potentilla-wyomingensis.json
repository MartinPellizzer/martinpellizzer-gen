    "intro": "Potentilla wyomingensis, commonly known as Wyoming cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has compound leaves with five leaflets, which is reflected in its common name. It thrives in rocky, dry habitats and is often found in alpine and arid regions. Potentilla wyomingensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
