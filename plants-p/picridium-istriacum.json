    "intro": "Picridium istriacum, commonly known as the Istrian picrid, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of Croatia, Italy, and Greece. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas and is of interest for conservation efforts."
