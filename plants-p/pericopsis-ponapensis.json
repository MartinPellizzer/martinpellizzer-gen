    "intro": "Pericopsis ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 pericopsis, is a tropical tree native to the island of Ponap\u00e9 in the Federated States of Micronesia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant has a straight, cylindrical trunk and can grow up to 20 meters in height, making it a significant component of the local forest canopy. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in traditional construction and craftsmanship. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
