    "intro": "Perymenium, commonly known as the seed coat, is a crucial botanical structure that protects the developing embryo within a seed. It is composed primarily of a tough, often waterproof layer made of lignin and other complex polymers. The seed coat can vary in thickness and texture depending on the plant species. In some cases, it may contain specialized cells that aid in seed dispersal or dormancy. Overall, the perymenium plays a vital role in the survival and germination of the seed."
