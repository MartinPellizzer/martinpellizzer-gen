    "intro": "Psoralea plauta, commonly known as the slender psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the pods that develop after flowering are slender and hairy. Psoralea plauta is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
