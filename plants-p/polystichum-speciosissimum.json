    "intro": "Polystichum speciosissimum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive golden-brown margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum speciosissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
