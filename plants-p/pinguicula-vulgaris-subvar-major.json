    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subvar. major, commonly known as the greater butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and appear in late spring to early summer. The species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
