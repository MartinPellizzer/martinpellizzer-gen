    "intro": "Poa kurynica, commonly known as the Kurynica grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fine texture that helps it thrive in humid environments. Poa kurynica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
