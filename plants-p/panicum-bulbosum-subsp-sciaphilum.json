    "intro": "Panicum bulbosum subsp. sciaphilum, commonly known as the shade-loving panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its habitat."
