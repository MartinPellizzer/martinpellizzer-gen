It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are popular with birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus padus is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
