    "intro": "Poa schizantha, commonly known as the split leaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a slightly zigzag or split appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa schizantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
