It features slender, grass-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces tall, upright stems bearing clusters of bright white or pale pink flowers. The flowers are typically trumpet-shaped and have a strong, sweet fragrance, especially at night. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil. It thrives in partial to full sun and is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family."
