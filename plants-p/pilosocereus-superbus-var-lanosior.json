    "intro": "Pilosocereus superbus var. lanosior, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems covered in dense, white to grayish woolly hairs. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique morphology and nocturnal flowering make it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
