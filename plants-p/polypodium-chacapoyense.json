    "intro": "Polypodium chacapoyense, commonly known as the Chacapoyes huperbole, is a fern native to the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
