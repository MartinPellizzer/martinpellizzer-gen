    "intro": "Planchonella membranacea, commonly known as the Papuan satinash, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, round fruits with a thin, leathery skin. Its bark is smooth and often has a distinctive reddish or greyish hue, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Planchonella membranacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to grow in suitable tropical or subtropical climates."
