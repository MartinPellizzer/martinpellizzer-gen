    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. acuminatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
