    "intro": "Pitcairnia fruticosa, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple, hence its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
