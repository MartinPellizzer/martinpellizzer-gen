    "intro": "Polypodium cunninghamii, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a perennial fern native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
