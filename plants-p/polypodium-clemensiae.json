    "intro": "Polypodium clemensiae, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium clemensiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
