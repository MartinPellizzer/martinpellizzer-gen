    "intro": "Pinguicula orchidioides, commonly known as the orchid-like butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and resemble those of orchids, contributing to its common name. Pinguicula orchidioides is a unique example of a carnivorous plant that combines specialized trapping mechanisms with ornamental floral features."
