    "intro": "Prangos persica, commonly known as Persian melon or Persian cucumber, is a flowering plant native to the regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes other aromatic plants like carrots and parsley. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by edible, green fruits resembling cucumbers in shape. The fruit is typically harvested before it fully matures, as it becomes bitter when allowed to ripen. Its botanical features include finely divided leaves and a distinct, fragrant aroma."
