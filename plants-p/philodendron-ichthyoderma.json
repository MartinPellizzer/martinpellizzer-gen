    "intro": "Philodendron ichthyoderma, commonly known as the Zebra Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that feature a distinctive pattern of light and dark green, resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant has heart-shaped to arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often glossy and can grow quite large. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Philodendron ichthyoderma is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
