    "intro": "Parinari subcordata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy dark green leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, orange-red berries. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is often confused with other similar species. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in local ecosystems."
