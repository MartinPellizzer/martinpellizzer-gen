    "intro": "Potentilla salsa, commonly known as desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing shrub with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Potentilla salsa is an important plant for pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
