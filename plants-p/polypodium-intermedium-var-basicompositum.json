    "intro": "Polypodium intermedium var. basicompositum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to lanceolate fronds that are usually bright green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid, well-drained conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
