    "intro": "Prasophyllum pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered leek orchid, is an orchid species native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish or brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky outcrops and heathlands. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
