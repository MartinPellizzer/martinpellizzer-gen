    "intro": "Phegopteris loxoscaphoides, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 20 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like appearance."
