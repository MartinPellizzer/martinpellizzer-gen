    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant Douglas-fir, is a variant of the Douglas-fir native to the western United States. It is a tall evergreen conifer characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and distinctive cone shape. The tree produces large, woody cones that release winged seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and insect damage. This variant is notable for its height and longevity, often reaching over 200 feet in elevation."
