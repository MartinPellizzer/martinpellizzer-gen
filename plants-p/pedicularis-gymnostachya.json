    "intro": "Pedicularis gymnostachya, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
