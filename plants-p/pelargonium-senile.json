    "intro": "Pelargonium senile, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces distinctive, long, hairy stems that resemble the beard of an old man, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically rounded and slightly hairy, with a velvety texture. Pelargonium senile is often cultivated as a decorative plant in hanging baskets or containers due to its cascading appearance."
