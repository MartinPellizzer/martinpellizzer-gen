    "intro": "Pinus mesogeensis, commonly known as the Aegean pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the rocky areas of the Greek islands. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree with a slender trunk and a conical crown. The needles are long, slender, and dark green, often arranged in bundles of five. Its cones are woody and contain edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and plays a significant role in the local ecosystem."
