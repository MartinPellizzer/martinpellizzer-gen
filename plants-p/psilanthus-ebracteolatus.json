    "intro": "Psilanthus ebracteolatus, commonly known as the small-leaved psilanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
