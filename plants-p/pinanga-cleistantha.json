    "intro": "Pinanga cleistantha, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
