    "intro": "Parthenium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Parthenium pinnatifidum is known for its ability to spread through seeds and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
