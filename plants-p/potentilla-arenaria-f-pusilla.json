It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters of five. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
