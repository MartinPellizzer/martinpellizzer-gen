It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, usually green or white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are opposite and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
