It features large, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive spurred structure. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed, and it produces long, slender peduncles that bear multiple flowering clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature."
