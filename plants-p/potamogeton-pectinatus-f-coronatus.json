It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are often ribbed and have a smooth surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in lakes, ponds, and wetlands. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and is important for aquatic ecosystems."
