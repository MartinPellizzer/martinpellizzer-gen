    "intro": "Phyllanthus zeylanicus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The hairy phyllanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
