    "intro": "Poa subpolaris, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It thrives in harsh environments such as Antarctica, southern South America, and New Zealand, where it forms dense mats on rocky or barren ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is adapted to survive in extreme cold and low nutrient conditions, with a deep root system to access moisture. Its botanical features make it an important component of polar and alpine ecosystems."
