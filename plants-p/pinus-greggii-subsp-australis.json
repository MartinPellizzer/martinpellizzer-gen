    "intro": "Pinus greggii subsp. australis, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a subspecies native to the high-altitude regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth, long lifespan, and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and its cones are small and often covered in a sticky resin. It is adapted to rocky soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological resilience and potential for studying climate change impacts on plant life."
