    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf plane, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf margins that give it its common name. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a rough, sandpapery texture. It produces small, spherical fruits that split open to release tufted seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climate conditions."
