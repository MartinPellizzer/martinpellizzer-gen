    "intro": "Pterichis fernandezii, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos fern, is a rare and unique fern species endemic to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the family Pterichis, which is closely related to the genus Blechnum. The plant has a distinctive, upright growth habit with deeply divided, leathery fronds that are dark green in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
