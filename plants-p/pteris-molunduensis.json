    "intro": "Pteris molunduensis, commonly known as the Molundu fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pteris molunduensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in tropical climates."
