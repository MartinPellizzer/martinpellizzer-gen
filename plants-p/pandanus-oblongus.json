    "intro": "Pandanus oblongus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in spadices, followed by the development of edible, fibrous fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can be used for various traditional purposes. Pandanus oblongus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the use of its leaves in basket weaving and thatching."
