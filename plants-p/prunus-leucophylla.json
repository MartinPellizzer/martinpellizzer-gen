    "intro": "Prunus leucophylla, commonly known as the whiteleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender branches and oval, white-veined leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible berries that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Prunus leucophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native range."
