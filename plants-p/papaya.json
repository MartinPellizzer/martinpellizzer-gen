    "intro": "Papaya, commonly known as *Carica papaya*, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Central America. It is a fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same plant, and the fruit develops from the female flowers. The fruit is typically yellow when ripe, with a soft, juicy interior containing black seeds. Papaya is valued for its high nutritional content, including vitamin C, enzymes like papain, and dietary fiber."
