    "intro": "Pinus palustris var. excelsa, commonly known as the longleaf pine, is a variant of the longleaf pine species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of two. The tree produces cones that mature over two years, with the outer scales opening to release seeds. It thrives in wet, sandy soils and is often found in coastal plain ecosystems. This variety plays a vital role in supporting diverse wildlife and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
