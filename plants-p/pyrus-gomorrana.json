    "intro": "Pyrus gomorrana, commonly known as the Gomorrha pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are followed by its distinctive, edible berries. It is often found growing in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny and well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus gomorrana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
