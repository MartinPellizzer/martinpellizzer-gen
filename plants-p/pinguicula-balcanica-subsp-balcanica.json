    "intro": "Pinguicula balcanica subsp. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, appearing in late spring to early summer. The species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
