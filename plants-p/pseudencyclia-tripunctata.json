    "intro": "Pseudencyclia tripunctata, commonly known as the three-spotted cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Pseudencyclia tripunctata is a slow-growing plant that plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem."
