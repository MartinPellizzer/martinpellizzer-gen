    "intro": "Plantago coronopus subvar. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety, with a hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
