    "intro": "Populus tremuloides var. rhomboidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aspen, is a variant of the trembling aspen found primarily in North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are narrower and more elongated compared to the typical aspen leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. Its bark is generally smoother and lighter in color than that of the common aspen. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across the northern United States and Canada."
