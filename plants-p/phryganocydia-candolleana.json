It is primarily found in the Andean regions of South America, where it inhabits high-altitude environments. The adult moths are small, with intricate wing patterns that often feature a mix of white, brown, and gray tones. The larvae feed on specific species of flowering plants, contributing to the ecological dynamics of their native habitats. Due to its restricted range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized species."
