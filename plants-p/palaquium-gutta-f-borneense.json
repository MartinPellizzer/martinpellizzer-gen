    "intro": "Palaquium gutta f. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean gutta, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a unique resin known as gutta-percha, which has historical uses in manufacturing and conservation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
