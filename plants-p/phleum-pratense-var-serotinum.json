    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. serotinum, commonly known as late meadow fescue, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
