    "intro": "Panicum gracile, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a soft texture. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance, especially in late summer and autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
