    "intro": "Philodendron roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often a deep green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This species is popular among plant enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
