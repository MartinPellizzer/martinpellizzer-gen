    "intro": "Pleopeltis glaucina, commonly known as the glaucous pleopeltis, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are usually covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss. Pleopeltis glaucina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
