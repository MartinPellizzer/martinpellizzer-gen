    "intro": "Plagiobothrys strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. It has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
