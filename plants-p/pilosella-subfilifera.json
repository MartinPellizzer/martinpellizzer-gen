    "intro": "Pilosella subfilifera, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, leaf-like stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks. Pilosella subfilifera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
