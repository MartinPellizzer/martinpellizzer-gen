    "intro": "Peperomia rotundifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the Round-leaf Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, ovate-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by reddish-brown berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and attractive foliage make it an excellent addition to shaded or low-light environments."
