    "intro": "Pellaea intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate cliffbrake, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Pellaea intermedia produces spores in small, clustered sori located on the underside of its fronds. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that prefers full sun to partial shade."
