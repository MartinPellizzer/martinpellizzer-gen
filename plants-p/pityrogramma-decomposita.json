    "intro": "Pityrogramma decomposita, commonly known as the brittle heart fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with a distinctive, pinnately divided structure. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant's ability to thrive in humid conditions makes it a common sight in rainforests and along stream banks."
