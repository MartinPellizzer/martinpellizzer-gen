It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its bulbous root system allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical climates.
