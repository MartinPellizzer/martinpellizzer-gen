    "intro": "Pleurothallis lagarophyta, commonly known as the white-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Pleurothallis lagarophyta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
