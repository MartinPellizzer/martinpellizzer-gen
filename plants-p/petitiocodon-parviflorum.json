    "intro": "Petitiocodon parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered leafy plant, is a delicate herbaceous species native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender, branching stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats on moist, shaded forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
