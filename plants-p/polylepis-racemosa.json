    "intro": "Polylepis racemosa, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid, high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems, often growing at elevations between 2,500 and 4,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Polylepis racemosa is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
