    "intro": "Phlox montana, commonly known as mountain phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Phlox montana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in native plant gardens."
