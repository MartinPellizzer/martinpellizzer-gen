    "intro": "Pandanus bicurvatus, commonly known as the zigzag palm, is a unique tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while its fruit is edible and often consumed raw or cooked. The species is adapted to coastal environments and thrives in sandy soils with high salinity."
