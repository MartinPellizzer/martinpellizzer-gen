    "intro": "Psidium ooideum, commonly known as the yellow guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow or orange fruits resembling small guavas. The fruit has a thin, leathery skin and a sweet, acidic pulp, making it edible and used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit."
