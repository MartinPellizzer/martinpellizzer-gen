    "intro": "Photinia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and bright red or pinkish flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. The leaves are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense hedges or screens."
