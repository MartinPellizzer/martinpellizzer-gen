    "intro": "Pteris borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon water fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing only roots and the second year forming the reproductive structures. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
