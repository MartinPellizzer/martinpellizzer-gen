    "intro": "Polygala macropetala, commonly known as the large-petaled milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and sometimes lavender. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Polygala macropetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and adequate sunlight."
