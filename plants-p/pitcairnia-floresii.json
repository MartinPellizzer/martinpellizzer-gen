    "intro": "Pitcairnia floresii, commonly known as the \"Flor de la Canela\" or \"Cinnamon Flower,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange bracts that resemble cinnamon sticks, which give it its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its flowering period typically occurs during the dry season, and the inflorescence is adorned with showy, long-lasting flowers. Pitcairnia floresii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
