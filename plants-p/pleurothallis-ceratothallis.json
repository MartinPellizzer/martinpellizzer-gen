    "intro": "Pleurothallis ceratothallis, commonly known as the horned pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a unique, horn-like appendage on the lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
