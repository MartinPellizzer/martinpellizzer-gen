    "intro": "Pilosocereus werdermannianus var. diamantinensis, commonly known as the Diamond Cactus, is a cacti species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense covering of white, woolly hairs, which provide insulation and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
