It features a ribbed, spiny stem that can grow up to 20 centimeters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
