    "intro": "Pouzolzia indica subvar. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate pouzolzia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically features prostrate or creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
