    "intro": "Pedilanthus pulchellus, commonly known as the golden dewdrop, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble dewdrops, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested."
