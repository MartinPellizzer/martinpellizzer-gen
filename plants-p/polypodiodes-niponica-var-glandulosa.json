It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
