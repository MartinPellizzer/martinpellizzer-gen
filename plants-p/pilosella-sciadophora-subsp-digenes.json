    "intro": "Pilosella sciadophora subsp. digenes, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, prostrate stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of trichomes. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
