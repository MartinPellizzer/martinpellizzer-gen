    "intro": "Phragmipedium schlimii, commonly known as the Schlim's boat orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces pseudobulbs and is covered in a dense, dark brown, fibrous sheath. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Phragmipedium schlimii is a popular choice for both greenhouse and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
