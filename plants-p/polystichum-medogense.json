    "intro": "Polystichum medogense, commonly known as the Medog fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayan region of Tibet. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest areas at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are robust and help it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates. The Medog fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
