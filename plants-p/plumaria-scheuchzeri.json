    "intro": "Plumaria scheuchzeri, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. The leaves have a waxy surface that helps repel water, a feature that aids in buoyancy and reduces the risk of rot."
