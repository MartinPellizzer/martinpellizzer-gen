    "intro": "Phaseolus amarus, commonly known as bitter snap bean, is a species of legume native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated pods containing several dark brown, kidney-shaped seeds. It is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of certain alkaloids and tannins. This plant is often grown as a traditional crop in tropical and subtropical regions."
