    "intro": "Paullinia pendulifolia, commonly known as the hanging soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but is generally smaller and less aromatic. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting."
