    "intro": "Polemonium moschatum, commonly known as the sweet peppergrass, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
