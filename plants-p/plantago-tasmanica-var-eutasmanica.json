It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. Its flowering stems bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Plantago tasmanica."
