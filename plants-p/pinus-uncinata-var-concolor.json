    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. concolor, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its distinctive bark that peels in thick, furrowed plates. The leaves are needle-like, typically measuring 2 to 4 centimeters in length, and are arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are small, woody, and often persist on the tree for several years. This species plays an important ecological role in high-elevation ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
