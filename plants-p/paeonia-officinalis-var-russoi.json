    "intro": "Paeonia officinalis var. russoi, commonly known as the Russian peony, is a variant of the peony species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant produces thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help it survive in its native habitat. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface. This variety is valued for both its ornamental beauty and traditional medicinal uses."
