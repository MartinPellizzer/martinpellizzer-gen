    "intro": "Pilosocereus flavipulvinatus subsp. carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina cactus, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, spiny cactus with a distinctive ribbed stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
