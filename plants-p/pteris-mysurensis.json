    "intro": "Pteris mysurensis, commonly known as the Mysore water fern, is a species of fern native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris mysurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
