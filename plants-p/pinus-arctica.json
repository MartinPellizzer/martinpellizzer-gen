    "intro": "Pinus arctica, commonly known as the arctic pine, is a small coniferous tree native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is adapted to harsh, cold climates and grows in tundra and rocky habitats. The tree has short, stiff needles and produces cones that contain its seeds. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Its resilience to extreme environmental conditions makes it a unique example of plant adaptation in polar environments."
