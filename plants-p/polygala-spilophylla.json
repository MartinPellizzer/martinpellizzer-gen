    "intro": "Polygala spilophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to silver-white leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred structure, typical of the Polygala genus. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
