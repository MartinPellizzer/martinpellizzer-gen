It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
