    "intro": "Platanthera angustata var. singgalangensis, commonly known as the Singgalang narrow-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded forest understories, often on decaying wood or in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It has a complex mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
