    "intro": "Periboea gawleri, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with ample sunlight. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Periboea gawleri plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
