It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. Due to its limited geographic distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
