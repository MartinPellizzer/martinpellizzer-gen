    "intro": "Poa nutans, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as lawns, meadows, and wetlands. Poa nutans is often used in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
