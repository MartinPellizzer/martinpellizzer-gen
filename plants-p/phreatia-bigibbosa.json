    "intro": "Phreatia bigibbosa, commonly known as the giant phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Phreatia bigibbosa thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests."
