    "intro": "Platanthera delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forest understories. It has a short rhizome and produces a single spike of flowers with long, slender sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
