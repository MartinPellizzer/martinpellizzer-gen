    "intro": "Pritchardia schattaueri, commonly known as the Schattauer\u2019s cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
