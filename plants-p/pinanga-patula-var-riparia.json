It is a clump-forming plant with slender, hollow stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near rivers and streams. Its rapid growth makes it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental gardening."
