    "intro": "Polypodium cyathoides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Polypodium cyathoides is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
