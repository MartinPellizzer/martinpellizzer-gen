    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. rotundata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high elevations of the western United States. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches and a dense, rounded form. Its needles are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the standard species, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The cones are small and often persist on the tree for several years, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions."
