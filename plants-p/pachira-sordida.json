    "intro": "Pachira sordida, commonly known as the sordid pachira, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, woody stem and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, greenish fruits containing several seeds. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it is not as widely cultivated as other pachira species like Pachira aquatica."
