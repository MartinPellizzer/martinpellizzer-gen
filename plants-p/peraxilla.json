    "intro": "Peraxilla, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, with several species found in Madagascar and mainland Africa. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, often with a velvety texture, and produce small, pea-like flowers. Peraxilla species are typically shrubs or small trees, and they have a deep root system that helps them thrive in poor soils. The genus is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation and its potential for use in agroforestry."
