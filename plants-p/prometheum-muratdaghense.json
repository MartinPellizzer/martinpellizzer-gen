    "intro": "Prometheum muratdaghense, commonly known as the Muratda\u011f flameplant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Muratda\u011f mountain range. It is characterized by its striking red-orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which bloom during the short summer season. The plant has adapted to the harsh, cold climate with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
