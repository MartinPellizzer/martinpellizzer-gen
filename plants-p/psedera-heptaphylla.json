    "intro": "Psedera heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leafed psedera, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive leaf structure. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features seven leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it its common name. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Psedera heptaphylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
