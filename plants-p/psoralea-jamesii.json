    "intro": "Psoralea jamesii, commonly known as the desert licorice, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across desert landscapes. Psoralea jamesii is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
