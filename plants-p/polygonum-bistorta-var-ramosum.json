    "intro": "Polygonum bistorta var. ramosum, commonly known as the creeping bistort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
