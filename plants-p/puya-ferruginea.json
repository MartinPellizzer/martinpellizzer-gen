    "intro": "Puya ferruginea, commonly known as the Andean torch or fire plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a striking evergreen plant with tall, spiky inflorescences that can reach heights of up to 10 feet, producing vibrant red and orange flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions with well-draining soil. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Puya ferruginea is known for its longevity, with some individuals living over 100 years, making it a symbol of resilience in its native habitat."
