    "intro": "Pimpinella capillacea, commonly known as slender cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Pimpinella capillacea is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
