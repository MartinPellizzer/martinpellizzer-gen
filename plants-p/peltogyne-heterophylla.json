    "intro": "Peltogyne heterophylla, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its wood is highly valued for its rich reddish color and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
