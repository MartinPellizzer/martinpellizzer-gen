It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically arranged in two opposing clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
