    "intro": "Phelipanche arenaria, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is an annual plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
