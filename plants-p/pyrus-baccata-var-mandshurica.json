    "intro": "Pyrus baccata var. mandshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, small, white fruits that are edible but often tart. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a rough texture that becomes more pronounced with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
