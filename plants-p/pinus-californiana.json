    "intro": "Pinus californiana, commonly known as the California madrone, is a deciduous conifer native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and bright orange to red berries that persist through winter. The plant has needle-like leaves that turn red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. The California madrone is also notable for its ability to produce new growth from its base after fires, making it resilient in fire-prone environments."
