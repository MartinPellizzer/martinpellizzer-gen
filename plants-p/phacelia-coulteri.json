    "intro": "Phacelia coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Coulter's phacelia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
