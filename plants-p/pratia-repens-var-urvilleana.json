    "intro": "Pratia repens var. urvilleana, commonly known as the creeping pratia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are elliptical to ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are often aromatic. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
