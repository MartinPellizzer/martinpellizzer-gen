    "intro": "Pithecellobium corymbosum, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant produces edible, bean-like pods that contain small, sweet seeds. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and often have a feathery appearance. The tree is also valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
