    "intro": "Paepalanthus inopinatus, commonly known as the Andean pincushion cactus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly spines and spherical shape, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Paepalanthus inopinatus is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
