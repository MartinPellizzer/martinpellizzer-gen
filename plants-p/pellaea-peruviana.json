It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The fronds are typically bioluminescent and have a unique, curling appearance."
