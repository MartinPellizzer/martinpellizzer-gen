It features a dense, spiny exterior with short, cylindrical spines that are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
