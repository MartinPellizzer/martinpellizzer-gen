    "intro": "Pinus rigida f. globosa, commonly known as the globe pine, is a unique variant of the eastern white pine. This form is characterized by its dense, spherical shape, which results from the close clustering of its branches. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The foliage consists of soft, needle-like leaves that give the plant a distinctive, feathery appearance. Despite its compact form, it retains the typical coniferous features of the pine genus, including cones and resinous sap."
