    "intro": "Pteris vespertilionis, commonly known as the bat fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost bat-like appearance, which gives it its common name. Pteris vespertilionis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant foliage."
