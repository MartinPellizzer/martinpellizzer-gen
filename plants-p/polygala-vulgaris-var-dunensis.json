It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that are often arranged in spikes, and its leaves are usually narrow and opposite. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing sandy soils."
