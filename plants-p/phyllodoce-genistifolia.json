    "intro": "Phyllodoce genistifolia, commonly known as the alpine whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in small umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Phyllodoce genistifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine insects and small mammals."
