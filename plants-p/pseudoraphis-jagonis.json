    "intro": "Pseudoraphis jagonis, commonly known as the Jagonis grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
