    "intro": "Phragmipedium reticulatum, commonly known as the netted phragmipedium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, hairy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
