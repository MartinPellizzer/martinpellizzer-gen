    "intro": "Parinari hostmannii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often grey or brown bark. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
