    "intro": "Psilosiphon avasmontanus, commonly known as the Andean bladderworts, is a unique aquatic plant found in the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae, which includes carnivorous plants, though it does not actively trap prey. The plant has specialized structures called bladders that can absorb nutrients from water, a trait shared with other members of its family. It thrives in nutrient-poor environments, such as mountain streams and wetlands. Its small, delicate leaves and flowers make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
