    "intro": "Potentilla viscida, commonly known as sticky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and wet meadows. Due to its unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation to wetland environments."
