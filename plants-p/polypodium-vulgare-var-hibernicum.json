    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. hibernicum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. This variety is often distinguished from the nominate form by its slightly more robust fronds and broader distribution across colder climates."
