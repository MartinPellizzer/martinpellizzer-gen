    "intro": "Primula stenocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its cool, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value and adaptability contribute to its cultivation in horticultural gardens."
