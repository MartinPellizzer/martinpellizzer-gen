    "intro": "Pimpinella nephrophylla, commonly known as the kidneyleaf cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence. It is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small white flowers are arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as schizocarps. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
