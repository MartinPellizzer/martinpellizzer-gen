    "intro": "Platanthera urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist woodlands and meadows in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified leaves called bracts that serve as photosynthetic organs. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
