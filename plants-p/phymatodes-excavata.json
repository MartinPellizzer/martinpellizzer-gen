    "intro": "Phymatodes excavata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, underground rhizomes and striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss. The flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, are tubular and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
