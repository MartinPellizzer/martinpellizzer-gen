    "intro": "Phlomis latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a silvery underside due to dense pubescence. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
