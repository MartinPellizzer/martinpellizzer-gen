    "intro": "Picea abies f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green spruce or chlorocarpa spruce, is a naturally occurring variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its darker, more intensely green foliage compared to the typical silver-blue color of the parent species. The leaves are shorter and more densely packed, giving the tree a compact, lush appearance. This form is often found in specific microclimates where cooler temperatures and higher humidity promote the development of its distinctive coloration. It is primarily of horticultural interest due to its aesthetic appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
