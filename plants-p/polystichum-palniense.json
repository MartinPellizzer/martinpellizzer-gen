    "intro": "Polystichum palniense, commonly known as the Palni mountain fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Polystichum palniense plays a significant role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for various microorganisms."
