    "intro": "Picea abies var. gregoryana, commonly known as the Gregory's fir, is a variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green needles that are slightly longer than those of the typical Norway spruce. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It is native to the Carpathian Mountains and thrives in cool, moist climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
