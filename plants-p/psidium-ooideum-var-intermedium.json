    "intro": "Psidium ooideum var. intermedium, commonly known as the hybrid guava, is a tropical plant belonging to the Myrtaceae family. It is a hybrid between Psidium guajava (common guava) and Psidium cattleianum (silverleaf guava), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into edible berries, which are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is valued for its fruit yield and adaptability."
