    "intro": "Polygala paucifolia, commonly known as the few-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in drought conditions. Polygala paucifolia is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
