    "intro": "Perezia recurvata var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile-leaved perezia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
