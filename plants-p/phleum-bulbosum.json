It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant produces spikelets that are often hairy and contain small, oval-shaped florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and agricultural research."
