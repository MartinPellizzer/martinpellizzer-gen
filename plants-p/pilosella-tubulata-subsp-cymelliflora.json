    "intro": "Pilosella tubulata subsp. cymelliflora, commonly known as the Alpine Mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, with a distinctive lobed or toothed margin, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
