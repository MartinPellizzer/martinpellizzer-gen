    "intro": "Pistacia terebinthus var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited terebinth, is a variant of the terebinth tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves and fruits have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of resin. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust fruits compared to the typical terebinth."
