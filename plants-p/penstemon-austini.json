It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and showy spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from violet to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Penstemon austini is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
