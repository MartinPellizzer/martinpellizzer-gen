    "intro": "Paronychia suffruticosa, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Paronychia suffruticosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
