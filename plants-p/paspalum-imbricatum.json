    "intro": "Paspalum imbricatum, commonly known as the flatleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming mats or low shrubs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically in the spring or early summer. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. Paspalum imbricatum is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
