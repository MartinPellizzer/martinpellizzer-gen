It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
