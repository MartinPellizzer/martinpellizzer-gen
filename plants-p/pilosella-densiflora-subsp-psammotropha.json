    "intro": "Pilosella densiflora subsp. psammotropha, commonly known as the sand-dwelling hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as dunes and rocky slopes."
