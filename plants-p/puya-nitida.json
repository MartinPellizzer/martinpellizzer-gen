    "intro": "Puya nitida, commonly known as the nitid puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Puya nitida is a perennial plant that thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in the study of Andean flora."
