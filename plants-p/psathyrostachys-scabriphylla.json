    "intro": "Psathyrostachys scabriphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas but also holds ecological significance in its native range."
