    "intro": "Polygonum viviparum var. subacaule, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and prominent veins. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. This plant is adapted to moist environments and can thrive in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
