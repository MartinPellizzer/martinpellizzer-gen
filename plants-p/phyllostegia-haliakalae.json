    "intro": "Phyllostegia haliakalae, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 phyllostegia, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the slopes of Haleakal\u0101 on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
