    "intro": "Pterocaulon sphaeranthoides, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its globular shape and is covered in small, spiny tubercles that protect it from herbivores and excessive sunlight. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiky structure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
