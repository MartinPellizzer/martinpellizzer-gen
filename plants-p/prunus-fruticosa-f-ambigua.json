It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical interest lies in its variability and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
