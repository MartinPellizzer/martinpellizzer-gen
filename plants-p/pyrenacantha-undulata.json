It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by spherical, red berries that are a striking feature of the plant. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
