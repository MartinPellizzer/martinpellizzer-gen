    "intro": "Pariana parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pariana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
