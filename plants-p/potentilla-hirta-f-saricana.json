    "intro": "Potentilla hirta f. saricana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it well-suited for rocky or gravelly soils. Botanically, it is characterized by its woody stems, alternate leaves, and its classification within the Rosaceae family."
