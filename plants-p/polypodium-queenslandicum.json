    "intro": "Polypodium queenslandicum, commonly known as the Queensland holly fern, is a perennial fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common ground cover in its natural habitat. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
