    "intro": "Primula pseudoglabra, commonly known as the rough primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, giving the plant its common name, and they are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its vibrant blooms."
