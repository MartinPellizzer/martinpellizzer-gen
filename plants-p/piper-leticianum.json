It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often twine around supporting structures. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while small greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters. The fruit, a small, three-lobed berry, is typically harvested when fully mature and is used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cuisines."
