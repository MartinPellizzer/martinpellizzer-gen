    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 donarium f. amayadori, commonly known as the Amayadori cherry, is a unique hybrid plant within the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly its showy, double-flowered blooms that appear in spring. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with a compact and bushy habit. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a glossy green surface and a slightly serrated margin. The fruit, when present, is a small, dark red drupe, though it is often not cultivated for its edibility."
