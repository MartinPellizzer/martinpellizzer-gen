    "intro": "Phymatopsis malacodon, commonly known as the redroot false lily of the wall, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, often found in limestone soils. The plant features a fibrous root system and produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are usually alternate and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The species is part of the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants."
