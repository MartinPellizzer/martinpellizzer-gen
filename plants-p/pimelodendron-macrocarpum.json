    "intro": "Pimelodendron macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom above the water and are pollinated by insects. Pimelodendron macrocarpum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
