    "intro": "Pellaea ternifolia subsp. brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often considered a vulnerable species."
