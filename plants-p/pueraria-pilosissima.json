    "intro": "Pueraria pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy pueraria, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white or pale purple flowers, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
