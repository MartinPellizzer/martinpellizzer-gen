    "intro": "Phelypaea concolor, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically smooth and lack the hairy texture found in many other fern species. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Phelypaea concolor plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration properties."
