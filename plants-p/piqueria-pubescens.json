    "intro": "Piqueria pubescens, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its bright yellow to orange flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Piqueria pubescens is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional Mexican agriculture."
