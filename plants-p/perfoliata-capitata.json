    "intro": "Perfoliata capitata, commonly known as the leafy mouse-ear or mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a dense cluster of small yellow flowers at the top of the stem. The leaves are often perforated, giving the plant its scientific name, and they are arranged in a way that allows the stem to pass through the center of the leaves. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and vegetative means."
