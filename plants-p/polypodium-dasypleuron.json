    "intro": "Polypodium dasypleuron, commonly known as the broad-pleuron huperbryon, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces multiple sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
