    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. wulfenii, commonly known as sea plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. This variant is an important part of coastal vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
