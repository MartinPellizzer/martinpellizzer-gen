    "intro": "Pandanus carolinensis, commonly known as the Caroline pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, feather-like crown. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green in color, which develop into edible berries. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important plant in beach ecosystems. The Caroline pandanus is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in the regions where it grows."
