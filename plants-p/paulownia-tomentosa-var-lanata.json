    "intro": "Paulownia tomentosa var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thick, velvety foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree has a rapid growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a striking ornamental plant. Its wood is lightweight and strong, historically valued for crafting furniture and musical instruments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
