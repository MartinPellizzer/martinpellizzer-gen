    "intro": "Potentilla villosa var. debilis, commonly known as the soft-haired cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features wiry, hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a soft, downy texture that distinguishes this variety from other Potentilla species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
