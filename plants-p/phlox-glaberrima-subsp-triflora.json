    "intro": "Phlox glaberrima subsp. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, fragrant, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for studying native plant adaptations in humid, temperate regions."
