    "intro": "Pneumatopteris callosa, commonly known as the rough fronds fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a distinctive, rough texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are divided into multiple segments, with the undersides often displaying a unique, hairy appearance. Pneumatopteris callosa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
