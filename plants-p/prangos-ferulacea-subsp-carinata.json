It features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive ribbed structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can reach considerable depth, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.
