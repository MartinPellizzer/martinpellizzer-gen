    "intro": "Plectranthus monostachyus subsp. lateriticola, commonly known as the rock plectranthus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and adaptability to arid environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
