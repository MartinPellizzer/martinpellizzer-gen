    "intro": "Psidium pilosum, commonly known as the hairy guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit, similar to a guava, is generally small and has a thin, edible skin. Psidium pilosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has limited use in culinary applications compared to other guava species."
