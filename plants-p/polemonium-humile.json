    "intro": "Polemonium humile, commonly known as the dwarf bluebead, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Polemonium humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
