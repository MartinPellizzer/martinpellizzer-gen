    "intro": "Panicum stenanthum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum stenanthum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
