    "intro": "Polystichum neozelandicum subsp. zerophyllum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a tall, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It features a robust, trunk-like rhizome that supports a dense crown of large, dark green, leathery fronds. The fronds are bi-lobed and can grow up to 3 meters in length, giving the plant a distinctive, tree-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
