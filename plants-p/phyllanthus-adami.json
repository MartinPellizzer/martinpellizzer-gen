    "intro": "Phyllanthus adami, commonly known as the African date tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red or orange berries that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of food in certain regions."
