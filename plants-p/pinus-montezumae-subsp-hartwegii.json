    "intro": "Pinus montezumae subsp. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's Mexican pine, is a subspecies native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree produces long, slender cones that release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against fires and harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local wildlife and contributing to forest ecosystems."
