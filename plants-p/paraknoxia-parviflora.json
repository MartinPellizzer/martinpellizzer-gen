    "intro": "Paraknoxia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered paraknoxia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
