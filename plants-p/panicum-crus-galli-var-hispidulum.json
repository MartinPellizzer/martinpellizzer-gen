It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant produces rough, bristly hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Bristlegrass is a perennial grass that plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
