    "intro": "Polystichum pseudorhomboideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated, and leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum pseudorhomboideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
