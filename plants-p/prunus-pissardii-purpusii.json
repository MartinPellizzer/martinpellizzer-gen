    "intro": "Prunus pissardii purpusii, commonly known as the Pissard's cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, hairy fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and delicate floral display."
