It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, elliptical leaflets and produces long, slender pods that contain flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in agroforestry systems."
