    "intro": "Panicum \u00d7 calliphyllum, commonly known as eastern gamagrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) and Panicum hystrix (eastern gamagrass). The plant is characterized by its tall, upright growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces panicles of small, fluffy seeds that are wind-dispersed. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
