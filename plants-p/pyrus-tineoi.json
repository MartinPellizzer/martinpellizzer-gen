    "intro": "Pyrus tineoi, commonly known as the Tineo pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, clustered flowers in the spring. Its fruits, which are typically small and edible, have been historically used in local cuisines. However, it is not widely cultivated today due to its limited range and specific environmental requirements."
