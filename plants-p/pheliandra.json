    "intro": "Pheliandra, commonly known as the pandanus or screw pine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spirally arranged leaves and robust, woody stems. Pheliandra species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing near coastal areas or in humid environments. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or greenish in color. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and others for their ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
