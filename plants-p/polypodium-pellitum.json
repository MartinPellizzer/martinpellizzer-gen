    "intro": "Polypodium pellitum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its wiry, creeping rhizome and its ability to thrive in rocky, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium pellitum is often found in moist, temperate regions and is well adapted to grow on limestone or other calcareous substrates."
