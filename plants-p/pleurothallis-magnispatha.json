    "intro": "Pleurothallis magnispatha, commonly known as the large-leafed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically arranged in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
