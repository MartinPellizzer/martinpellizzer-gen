    "intro": "Phlegmariurus oceanianus, commonly known as the oceanic haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like shoots and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Phlegmariurus oceanianus plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
