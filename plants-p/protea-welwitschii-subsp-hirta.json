    "intro": "Protea welwitschii subsp. hirta, commonly known as the Hirta protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers arranged in a spherical or conical shape. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the fynbos biome of the Western Cape. Its leaves are leathery and often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
