It is characterized by its delicate, fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique texture. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and often produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
