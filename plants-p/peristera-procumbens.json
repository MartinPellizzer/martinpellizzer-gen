    "intro": "Peristera procumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Peristera procumbens is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
