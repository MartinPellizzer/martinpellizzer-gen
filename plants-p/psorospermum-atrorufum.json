    "intro": "Psorospermum atrorufum, commonly known as the black-red psorospermum, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and mangrove environments, often growing in saline or waterlogged soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting local biodiversity."
