    "intro": "Phegopteris sparsisora, commonly known as the sparse fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across forest floors. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in deciduous forests."
