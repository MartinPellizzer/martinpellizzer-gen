    "intro": "Plantago albicans, commonly known as white plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Botanically, it is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional remedies for its anti-inflammatory and soothing effects."
