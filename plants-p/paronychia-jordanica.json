    "intro": "Paronychia jordanica, commonly known as Jordan's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of Jordan and Saudi Arabia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant has a low-growing habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Paronychia jordanica is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions with minimal rainfall."
