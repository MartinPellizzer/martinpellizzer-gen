    "intro": "Potentilla magna, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features small, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Potentilla magna is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in alpine landscapes."
