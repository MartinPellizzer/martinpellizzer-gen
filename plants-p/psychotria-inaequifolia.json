    "intro": "Psychotria inaequifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that vary in size, giving it its common name. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in cymes, which are often visited by various pollinators. The plant is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, similar to other members of the Psychotria genus."
