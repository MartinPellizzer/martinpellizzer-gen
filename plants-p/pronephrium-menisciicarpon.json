    "intro": "Pronephrium menisciicarpon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often have a bluish-green color, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. The plant is known for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
