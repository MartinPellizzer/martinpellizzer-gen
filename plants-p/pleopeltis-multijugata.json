    "intro": "Pleopeltis multijugata, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
