    "intro": "Portulaca rostellata, commonly known as the coral plant or red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that produces vibrant red or orange flowers. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the tips of the stems and bloom in summer. Portulaca rostellata is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
