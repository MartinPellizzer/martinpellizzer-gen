    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subsp. serpyllacea, commonly known as field milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
