    "intro": "Prosartes hookeri var. trachyandra, commonly known as the roughleaf false fern, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its fern-like appearance with compound, pinnately arranged leaves. The leaves are typically rough to the touch due to the presence of fine, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
