It features feathery, bipinnate fronds that are dark green and glossy, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Polystichum fortunei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
