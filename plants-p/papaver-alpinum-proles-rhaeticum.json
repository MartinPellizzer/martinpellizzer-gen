    "intro": "Papaver alpinum proles rhaeticum, commonly known as the Rhaetic Alpine poppy, is a rare and striking botanical species native to the alpine regions of the Eastern Alps. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing intricate petals that are often marked with dark veins. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often growing in meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
