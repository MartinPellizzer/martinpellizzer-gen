    "intro": "Paspalum conjugatum, commonly known as the common paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
