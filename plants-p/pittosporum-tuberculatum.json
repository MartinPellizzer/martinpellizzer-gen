    "intro": "Pittosporum tuberculatum, commonly known as the rough-leaved pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its rough, textured bark and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are followed by bright orange berries, which are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Pittosporum tuberculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
