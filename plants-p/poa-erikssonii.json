    "intro": "Poa erikssonii, commonly known as the Eriksson's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
