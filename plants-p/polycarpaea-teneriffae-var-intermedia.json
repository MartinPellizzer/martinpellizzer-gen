    "intro": "Polycarpaea teneriffae var. intermedia, commonly known as the Canary Island bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually hairy and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
