    "intro": "Paracalanthe reflexa var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy reflexed calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in mountainous forest understories. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
