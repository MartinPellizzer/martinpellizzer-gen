    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dense foliage, which gives it a pyramidal appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, and it produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes planted in gardens and landscapes."
