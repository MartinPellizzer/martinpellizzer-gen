It is characterized by its distinctive, branched structure that resembles a candle, with multiple whorls of small, pale green leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers with long, narrow petals. It thrives in the arid, rocky environments of its native habitat, showing remarkable adaptations to the harsh climate. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of significant botanical interest and conservation concern."
