    "intro": "Penstemon argutus, commonly known as the rough beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Penstemon argutus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
