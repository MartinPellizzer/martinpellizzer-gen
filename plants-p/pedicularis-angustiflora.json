    "intro": "Pedicularis angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a distinctive hooded shape. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, typically growing in rocky or open habitats. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
