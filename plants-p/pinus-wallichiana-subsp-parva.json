    "intro": "Pinus wallichiana subsp. parva, commonly known as the dwarf Himalayan pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches and needle-like leaves that are typically 2\u20134 cm long. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds in the fall. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
