    "intro": "Polyachyrus auritus, commonly known as the ear-shaped fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique ear-like appearance has made it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
