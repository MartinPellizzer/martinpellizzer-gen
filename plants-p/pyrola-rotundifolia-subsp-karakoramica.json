    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia subsp. karakoramica, commonly known as the Karakoram wintergreen, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram mountain range. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its subsp. karakoramica is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical subspecies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
