    "intro": "Pandanus pluriloculatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, palm-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which eventually develop into woody, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be woven into mats and thatch, making it economically valuable in some regions. The species is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, tropical climates."
