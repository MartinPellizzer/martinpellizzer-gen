    "intro": "Paullinia polyphylla, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
