    "intro": "Pectis arenaria, commonly known as the sand pectis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a head-like cluster, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Pectis arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
