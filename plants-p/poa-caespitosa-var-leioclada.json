    "intro": "Poa caespitosa var. leioclada, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, low-growing foliage, forming compact clumps that are often found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced under stress. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish spikelets. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging conditions."
