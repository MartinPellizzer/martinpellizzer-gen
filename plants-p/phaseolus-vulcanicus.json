    "intro": "Phaseolus vulcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic bean, is a rare and unique legume native to volcanic regions. It is characterized by its distinctive pod structure and small, round seeds. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils found in volcanic areas. Its growth is closely associated with specific microclimates that provide the necessary heat and moisture. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
