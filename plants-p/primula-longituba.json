    "intro": "Primula longituba, commonly known as the long-tube primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its upright stem and clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Primula longituba is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in cool, moist environments."
