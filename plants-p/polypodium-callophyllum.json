    "intro": "Polypodium callophyllum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Polypodium callophyllum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat."
