    "intro": "Pronephrium borneense, commonly known as the Borneo pronephrium, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to the trunks of trees in the dense canopy. Its leaves are ovate with a waxy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, Pronephrium borneense is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
