    "intro": "Potentilla acaulis subsp. arenaria, commonly known as sand potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
