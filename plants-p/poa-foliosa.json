    "intro": "Poa foliosa, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Poa foliosa typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
