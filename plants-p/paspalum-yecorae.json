It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Paspalum yecorae is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in landscaping and erosion control in suitable climates."
