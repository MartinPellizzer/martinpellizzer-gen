    "intro": "Pedilochilus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed pedilochilus, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and long, wiry stems that often bear a cluster of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under the forest canopy, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually short-lived but attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pedilochilus longipes is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
