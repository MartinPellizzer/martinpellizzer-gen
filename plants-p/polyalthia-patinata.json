    "intro": "Polyalthia patinata, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces woody, cylindrical pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a shade tree in tropical regions."
