    "intro": "Pleopeltis torulosa, commonly known as the crested rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, leathery fronds that often have a waxy coating. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis torulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
