    "intro": "Pholidostachys occidentalis, commonly known as the western pholidostachys, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western regions of North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
