    "intro": "Pinus araucana, commonly known as the Andean pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive pine cone, which can grow up to 30 centimeters in length and is often used by indigenous communities for various purposes. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in pairs, and it produces a unique type of seed called a \"pine nut\" that is edible. Pinus araucana is adapted to high-altitude environments and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
