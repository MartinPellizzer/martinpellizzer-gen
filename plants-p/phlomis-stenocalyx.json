    "intro": "Phlomis stenocalyx, commonly known as narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular plant in xeriscaping."
