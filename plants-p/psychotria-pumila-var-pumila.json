    "intro": "Psychotria pumila var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf psychotria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 cm, featuring dense, dark green foliage with elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries containing seeds. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understory habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
