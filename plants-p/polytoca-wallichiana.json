    "intro": "Polytoca wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and mountainous regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to the harsh alpine climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
