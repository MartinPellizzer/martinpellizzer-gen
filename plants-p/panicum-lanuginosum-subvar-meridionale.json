    "intro": "Panicum lanuginosum subvar. meridionale, commonly known as the southern hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and panicles of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The botanical features of this subvariety make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
