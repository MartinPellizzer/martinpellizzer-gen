    "intro": "Pluchea phagnaloides, commonly known as swamp chervil, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and it often grows in moist soils along riverbanks and marshes. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and antispasmodic properties. Pluchea phagnaloides is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
