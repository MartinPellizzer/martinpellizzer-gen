    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides f. cristatum, commonly known as the crested Christmas fern, is a varietal form of the Christmas fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fronds that give it a unique, almost lace-like appearance. This fern is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
