    "intro": "Pennisetum flavicomum, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to Africa. It features slender, arching blades that range from green to purple in color, with distinctive, fluffy seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its foliage provides visual interest throughout the growing season, and it is often used in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic appeal. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
