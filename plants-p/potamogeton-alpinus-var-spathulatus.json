It typically grows in shallow lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams in temperate and subarctic regions. The plant has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often dark green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers arranged separately. This variety is adapted to low light conditions and plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
