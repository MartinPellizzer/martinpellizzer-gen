    "intro": "Poa lamarckii, commonly known as Lamarck's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, bluish-gray foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
