    "intro": "Poa buckleyana var. elongata, commonly known as Buckley's meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and ability to form compact, attractive clumps."
