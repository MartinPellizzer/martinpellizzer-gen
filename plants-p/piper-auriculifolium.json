It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow-green berries that contain the spicy compound piperine, similar to other members of the Piper genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
