    "intro": "Phlegmariurus rupicola, commonly known as the rock moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest floors. The plant has a distinctive structure with a thallus that is green and often covered in a layer of fine, thread-like structures called rhizoids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called soridia. Phlegmariurus rupicola plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a microhabitat for various invertebrates."
