    "intro": "Pachycereus pecten-aboriginum subsp. tehuantepecanus, commonly known as the Tehuantepec cactus, is a columnar cactus native to southern Mexico. It features thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its spines are typically short and sparse, providing minimal protection but allowing for some shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appearance and resilience in dry climates."
