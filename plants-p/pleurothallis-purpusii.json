    "intro": "Pleurothallis purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern, aiding in efficient light capture. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
