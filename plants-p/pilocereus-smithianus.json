    "intro": "Pilocereus smithianus, commonly known as the Smith's night bloomer, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers open only during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Pilocereus smithianus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique blooming habit."
