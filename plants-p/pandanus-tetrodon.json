    "intro": "Pandanus tetrodon, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically grouped in spikes, which eventually develop into large, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and basket weaving due to their durability and flexibility. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
