    "intro": "Pepinia subjuncta, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. The plant has a compact growth form with hairy stems and leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and strong winds. It is often found in rocky soils and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pepinia subjuncta is considered a vulnerable species."
