    "intro": "Parathelypteris qinlingensis, commonly known as Qinling water fern, is a rare fern species native to the Qinling Mountains in China. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
