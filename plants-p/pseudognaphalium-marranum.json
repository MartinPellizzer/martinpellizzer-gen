    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium marranum, commonly known as common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It has finely divided leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Pseudognaphalium marranum is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and birds."
