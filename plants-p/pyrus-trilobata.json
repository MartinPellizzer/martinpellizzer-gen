    "intro": "Pyrus trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which have three distinct leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in the fall. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, is used in some local cuisines and has a tart flavor. Pyrus trilobata is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
