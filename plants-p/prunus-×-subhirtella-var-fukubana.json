    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 subhirtella var. fukubana, commonly known as the Fukubana cherry, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is prized for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and has a rounded, compact form. Its leaves are ovate with a glossy surface and turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The Fukubana cherry is well-suited to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
