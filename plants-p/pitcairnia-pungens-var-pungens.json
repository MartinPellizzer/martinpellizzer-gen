    "intro": "Pitcairnia pungens var. pungens, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, recurved, spiky leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in suitable climates."
