    "intro": "Pachygenium paraguayense, commonly known as the Paraguay giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, making it one of the most visually impressive orchids. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
