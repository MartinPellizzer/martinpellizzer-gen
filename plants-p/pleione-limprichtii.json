    "intro": "Pleione limprichtii, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink flowers with a distinct lip, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests and alpine meadows. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
