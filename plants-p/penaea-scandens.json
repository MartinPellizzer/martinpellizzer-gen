    "intro": "Penaea scandens, commonly known as the climbing morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found twining around trees, shrubs, or structures in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and attractive blooms make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can become invasive if not managed. The flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
