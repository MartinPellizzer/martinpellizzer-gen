    "intro": "Poa psilophylla, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa psilophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
