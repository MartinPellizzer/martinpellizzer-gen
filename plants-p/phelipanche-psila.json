It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a weed of concern in agricultural settings."
