    "intro": "Pinus sabiniana f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a botanical variant of the knobcone pine. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to the typical knobcone pine, with shorter needles and a dense, shrub-like appearance. This form is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations. The cones are smaller and more rounded, and the tree produces a distinctive, aromatic resin. It is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
