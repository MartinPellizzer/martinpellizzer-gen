    "intro": "Peucedanum dregeanum, commonly known as African cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dry fruits called schizocarps. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Peucedanum dregeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
