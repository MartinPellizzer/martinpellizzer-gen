    "intro": "Phacelia dubia var. interior, commonly known as the interior phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and thrives in full sun. It has been used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife. Its short lifespan and rapid growth make it an important component of early successional plant communities."
