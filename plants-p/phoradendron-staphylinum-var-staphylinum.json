    "intro": "Phoradendron staphylinum var. staphylinum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, typically in forested areas. Its botanical structure includes a stem with small leaves and a complex system of haustoria for attaching to the host."
