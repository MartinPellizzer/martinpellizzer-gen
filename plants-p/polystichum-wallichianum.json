    "intro": "Polystichum wallichianum, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a shield-like shape. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
