    "intro": "Paspalum hydrophilum, commonly known as water paspalum, is a perennial grass native to wetland environments in the Americas. It thrives in moist or aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has long, slender leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Paspalum hydrophilum is also used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and resilience."
