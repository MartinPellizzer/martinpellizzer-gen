    "intro": "Phreatia leucostachya, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, which is essential for its survival in tropical climates. The orchid's structure and flowering habits make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticultural collections."
