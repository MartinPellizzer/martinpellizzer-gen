    "intro": "Polystachya malilaensis, commonly known as the Malila orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
