    "intro": "Pinus scarina, commonly known as the Sitka spruce, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in coastal areas and is well adapted to moist, temperate climates. Pinus scarina is valued for its strong, lightweight wood used in construction and musical instruments."
