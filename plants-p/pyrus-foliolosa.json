    "intro": "Pyrus foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy pear or foliolose pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into multiple leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are pomes, similar to pears, but are typically smaller and less commonly cultivated. Pyrus foliolosa is native to parts of Asia and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats."
