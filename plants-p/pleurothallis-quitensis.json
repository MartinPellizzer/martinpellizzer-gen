    "intro": "Pleurothallis quitensis, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, high-altitude environment. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps reduce water loss. Pleurothallis quitensis is often found growing on trees or rocks, forming an epiphytic relationship with its host."
