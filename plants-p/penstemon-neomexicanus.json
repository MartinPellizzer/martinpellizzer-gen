    "intro": "Penstemon neomexicanus, commonly known as New Mexico beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. Penstemon neomexicanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water landscapes."
