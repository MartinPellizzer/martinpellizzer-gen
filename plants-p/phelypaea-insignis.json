    "intro": "Phelypaea insignis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant has long, delicate fronds that float on the water surface, with roots hanging beneath. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phelypaea insignis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
