    "intro": "Pterocarpus buxifolius, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and a distinctive glossy appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The tree is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
