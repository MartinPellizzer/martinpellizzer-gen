    "intro": "Prescottia pellucida, commonly known as the glassy moss orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces tiny, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
