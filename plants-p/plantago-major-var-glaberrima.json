    "intro": "Plantago major var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves. It is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and gardens. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated and often go unnoticed."
