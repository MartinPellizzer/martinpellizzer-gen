    "intro": "Pinguicula macroceras, commonly known as the giant butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake through insect prey."
