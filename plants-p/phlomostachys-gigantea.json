    "intro": "Phlomostachys gigantea, commonly known as giant phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking floral display and drought tolerance."
