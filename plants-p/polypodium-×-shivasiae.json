    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 shivasiae, commonly known as the hybrid wall fern, is a fern species that results from the cross between Polypodium aculeatum and Polypodium polystichum. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
