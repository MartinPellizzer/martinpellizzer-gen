    "intro": "Pimenta dioica, commonly known as allspice, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, dark red berries that are harvested when fully mature. The plant typically grows to a height of 4 to 6 meters and has small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in spikes, and it produces fruit that develops from the fertilized flower buds. The botanical features of Pimenta dioica make it well-suited for cultivation in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
