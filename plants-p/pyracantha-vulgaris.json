    "intro": "Pyracantha vulgaris, commonly known as the firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, orange-red berries that persist through winter. The plant produces showy white or yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by the bright berries. Its foliage is typically dark green, providing contrast to the vibrant fruits. Pyracantha vulgaris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
