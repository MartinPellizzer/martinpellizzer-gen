    "intro": "Phlox nana subsp. eunana, commonly known as the dwarf phlox or small-flowered phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches a height of around 10 to 20 centimeters, with compact, mounding foliage that is often covered in a dense mat of leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall texture and appearance."
