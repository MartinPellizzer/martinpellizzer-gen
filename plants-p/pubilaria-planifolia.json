    "intro": "Pubilaria planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf pubilaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which appear in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild diuretic properties. Pubilaria planifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
