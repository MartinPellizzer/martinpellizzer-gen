    "intro": "Paederia linearis, commonly known as the slender paederia, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its slender stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often accompanied by a distinctive, fragrant odor. Its fruit is a hairy, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Paederia linearis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
