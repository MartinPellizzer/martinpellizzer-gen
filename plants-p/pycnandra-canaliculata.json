    "intro": "Pycnandra canaliculata, commonly known as the white-veined sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves with prominent white veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
