    "intro": "Pericallis aurita, commonly known as the golden crown orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble miniature suns. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Pericallis aurita is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
