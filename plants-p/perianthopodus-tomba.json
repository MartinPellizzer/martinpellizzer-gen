It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of a single umbel-like structure composed of small, white flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with finely divided leaves that resemble those of other members of its family. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for taxonomic study and ecological research. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
