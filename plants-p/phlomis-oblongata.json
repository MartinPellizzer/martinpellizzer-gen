    "intro": "Phlomis oblongata, commonly known as narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Phlomis oblongata is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, making it a hardy and resilient species."
