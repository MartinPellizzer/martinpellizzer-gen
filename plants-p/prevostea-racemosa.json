    "intro": "Prevostea racemosa, commonly known as the red-flowered rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, showy red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Prevostea racemosa is often found in high-altitude environments, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of alpine ecosystems."
