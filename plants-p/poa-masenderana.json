    "intro": "Poa masenderana, commonly known as the Masenderan grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Poa masenderana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and drought tolerance."
