    "intro": "Pritchardia woodii, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, stiff, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Pritchardia woodii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the volcanic terrain of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
