    "intro": "Pennisetum spicatum var. macrostachyum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to Africa. It features slender, arching blades that form a dense, fountain-like shape, often reaching heights of 3 to 5 feet. The plant produces feathery, silver-green plumes in late summer, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes. Its foliage is evergreen in mild climates but may die back in colder regions, regrowing from the base in spring."
