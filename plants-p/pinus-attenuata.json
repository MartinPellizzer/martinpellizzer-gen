    "intro": "Pinus attenuata, commonly known as the coastal lacebark pine, is a species of pine native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and thin, flaky bark that peels in strips. The tree produces small, pale yellow cones and has needle-like leaves that are typically 4 to 6 inches long. It thrives in coastal environments with sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
