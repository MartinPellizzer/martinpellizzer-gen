It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred petal. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
