It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its small, globular shape and vibrant, colorful flowers. The plant has a short, cylindrical stem with areoles that bear clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Its foliage consists of spines and woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment. Parodia minor is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
