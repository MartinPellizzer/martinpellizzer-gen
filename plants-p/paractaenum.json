    "intro": "Paractaenum, commonly known as the false foxglove, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. Paractaenum species often grow as shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple leaves that are usually lance-shaped. The flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, making it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
