It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous flowers, which are often fragrant. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.
