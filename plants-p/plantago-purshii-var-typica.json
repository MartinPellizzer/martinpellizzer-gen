It features upright, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows and along roadsides."
