    "intro": "Prasophyllum patens var. robustum, commonly known as the robust orchid, is a species native to the southeastern regions of Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous growth habit and produces tall, erect flowering stems. The plant typically features lance-shaped leaves and bears small, greenish or white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open heathlands or grassy areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
