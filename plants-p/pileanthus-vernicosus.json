    "intro": "Pileanthus vernicosus, commonly known as the red-flowered poinsettia, is a striking plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is typically green and succulent, with a slightly waxy texture. Pileanthus vernicosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant, especially during the holiday season due to its association with Christmas."
