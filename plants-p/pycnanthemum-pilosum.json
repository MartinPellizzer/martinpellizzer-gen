It features aromatic, hairy leaves that are often grayish-green in color, and it produces showy, lavender-blue flower clusters in late summer. The plant is part of the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is characterized by square stems and fragrant foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and open fields. Pycnanthemum pilosum is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
