    "intro": "Puccinellia distans subsp. glauca, commonly known as bluegrass puccinellia, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as sand dunes, roadsides, and gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, blue-gray leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions due to its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. This subspecies is often found in association with other xerophytic plants in its native environment."
