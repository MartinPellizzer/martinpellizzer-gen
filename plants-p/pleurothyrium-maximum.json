    "intro": "Pleurothyrium maximum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by dark blue berries. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species."
