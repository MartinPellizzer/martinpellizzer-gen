    "intro": "Phegopteris falcata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that are adorned with a cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The cinnamon fern plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms."
