    "intro": "Polygala sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and undergrowth. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, while its flowers are usually pink or purple and clustered in racemes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest in botanical research for its unique morphology and ecological role."
