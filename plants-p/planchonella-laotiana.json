    "intro": "Planchonella laotiana, commonly known as the Laotian native lime, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, smooth fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often marked with shallow fissures. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited economic use in traditional medicine."
