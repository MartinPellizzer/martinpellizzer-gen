It produces small, yellow, lantern-shaped fruits that are encased in a papery husk. The plant features hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. The fruit is edible when fully ripe and has a tart, tangy flavor."
