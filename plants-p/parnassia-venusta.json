    "intro": "Parnassia venusta, commonly known as the showy parnassia, is a striking member of the Buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in areas like the Himalayas and Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its large, white, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Parnassia venusta is often found in moist, rocky soils and is a popular subject in botanical gardens due to its ornamental value."
