    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis mentosa, commonly known as the Mentosa orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its pseudobulbs are compact, and it produces long, arching inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation."
