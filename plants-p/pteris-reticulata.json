    "intro": "Pteris reticulata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds."
