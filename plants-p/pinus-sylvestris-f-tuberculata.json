    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. tuberculata, commonly known as the Scots pine variegated form, is a variant of the Scots pine characterized by its unique foliage. Its needles are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical Scots pine, and they often exhibit a distinctive yellowish or white band near the base. This form is typically found in cooler, more humid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The cones are similar to those of the standard Scots pine, but the seedlings may show more pronounced variegation. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
