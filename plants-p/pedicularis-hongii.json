    "intro": "Pedicularis hongii, commonly known as the Hong Kong lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
