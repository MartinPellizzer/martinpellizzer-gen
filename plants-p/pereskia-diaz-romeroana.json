    "intro": "Pereskia diaz-romeroana, commonly known as the Diaz-Romeroana cactus, is a rare species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
