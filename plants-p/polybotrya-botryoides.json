It is characterized by its distinctive, branching, coral-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are simple and opposite, with a rough texture that helps it adapt to arid environments."
