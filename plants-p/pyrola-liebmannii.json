    "intro": "Pyrola liebmannii, commonly known as Liebmann's snowbell, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are typically oval and have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in cold, moist environments. Pyrola liebmannii is often found in rocky or shaded habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor soils typical of mountainous regions."
