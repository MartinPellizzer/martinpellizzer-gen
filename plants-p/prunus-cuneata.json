It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Prunus cuneata is also valued for its role in wildlife habitat and erosion control."
