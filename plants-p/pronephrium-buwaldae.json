    "intro": "Pronephrium buwaldae, commonly known as the Bornean bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant is typically found in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies where it supplements its nutrient intake through predation. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing above the water surface. Pronephrium buwaldae plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling small aquatic invertebrates and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
