    "intro": "Polystachya albescens subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
