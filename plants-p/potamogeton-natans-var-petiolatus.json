    "intro": "Potamogeton natans var. petiolatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has long, thin, flexible stems that often branch and bear small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality and is often found in shallow, nutrient-rich lakes and ponds."
