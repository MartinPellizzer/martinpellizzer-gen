It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy surface, reducing water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
