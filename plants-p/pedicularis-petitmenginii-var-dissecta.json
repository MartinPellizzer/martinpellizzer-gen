    "intro": "Pedicularis petitmenginii var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. This perennial herb is native to alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps, where it thrives in rocky and nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically pink to purple, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by specific insect species. The plant exhibits a rosette growth form, with basal leaves that are finely dissected, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
