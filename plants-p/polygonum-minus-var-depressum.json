    "intro": "Polygonum minus var. depressum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish-purple underside. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils."
