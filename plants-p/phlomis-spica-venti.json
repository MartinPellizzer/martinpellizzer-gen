It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, spires of purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Phlomis spica-venti is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
