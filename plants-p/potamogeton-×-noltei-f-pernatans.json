    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 noltei f. pernatans, commonly known as the broad-leaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in shallow waters with soft substrates. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
