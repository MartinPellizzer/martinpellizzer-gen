    "intro": "Physalis latiphysa, commonly known as the broad-leafed huskfruit, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny calyces that encase the small, orange-yellow fruits. The leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture and a distinctive waxy coating. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both gardens and ecological studies."
