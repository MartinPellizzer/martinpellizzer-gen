    "intro": "Prevostea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Prevostea amazonica plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators."
