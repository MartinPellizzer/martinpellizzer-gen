    "intro": "Palala simiarum, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a tropical climbing plant characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, star-shaped blooms that emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires support structures to climb."
