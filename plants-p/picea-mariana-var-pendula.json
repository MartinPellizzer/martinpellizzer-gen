It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches that hang in a cascading manner, giving it a unique, ornamental appearance. The tree typically grows in boreal forests and can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted.
