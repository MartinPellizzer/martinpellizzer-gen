    "intro": "Pandanus erythros, commonly known as the red pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in making ropes and mats. The red pandanus thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangroves or in sandy soils."
