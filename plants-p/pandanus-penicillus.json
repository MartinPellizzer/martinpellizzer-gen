    "intro": "Pandanus penicillus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, feather-like leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces long, narrow inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, which are often used in traditional crafts. Its leaves are tough and fibrous, making them useful for thatching and weaving. Pandanus penicillus thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing near mangroves or in sandy soils."
