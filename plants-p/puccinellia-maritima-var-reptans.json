    "intro": "Puccinellia maritima var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping saltmarsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant typically thrives in saline and brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
