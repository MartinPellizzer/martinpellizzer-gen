    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. rhomoidea, commonly known as the rough-leaved pear, is a botanical variant of the pear tree characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central and southern Europe. The leaves are typically larger and more serrated compared to the typical form of Pyrus pyraster. The flowers are white and clustered, followed by small, edible fruits that are often used in jams and preserves. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture."
