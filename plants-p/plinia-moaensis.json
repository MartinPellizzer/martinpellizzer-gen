    "intro": "Plinia moaensis, commonly known as the Moa berry, is a species of shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, red, fleshy berries that are edible. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a fragrant, resinous aroma. Plinia moaensis is notable for its historical association with the extinct Moa bird, which likely consumed its fruit."
