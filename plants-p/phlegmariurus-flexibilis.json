    "intro": "Phlegmariurus flexibilis, commonly known as the flexible clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila. Phlegmariurus flexibilis is characterized by its flexible, branching stems that can bend without breaking, which aids in its survival in rocky habitats. It plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
