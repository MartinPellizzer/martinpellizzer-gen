    "intro": "Prunus communis proles erythrocalyx, commonly known as the red-veined cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive red veins on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red or black cherries in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity."
