    "intro": "Protolirion sakuraii, commonly known as the Sakurai's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Protolirion sakuraii is considered a critically endangered species."
