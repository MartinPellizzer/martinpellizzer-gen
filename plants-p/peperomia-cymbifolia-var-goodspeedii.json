It features glossy, ovate leaves with a deep green color and a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and green, which appear in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
