    "intro": "Physalis angulata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy gooseberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange berries that are edible when ripe but can be bitter. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The hairy stems and leaves are covered in fine, whitish pubescence, contributing to its common name."
