    "intro": "Psittacanthus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous root system that anchors it to host trees. The plant produces large, leathery, obovate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Its unique morphology makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
