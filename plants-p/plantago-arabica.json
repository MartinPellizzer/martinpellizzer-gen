    "intro": "Plantago arabica, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, capable of storing water, which helps it survive in dry conditions. Plantago arabica is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and along fences, making it a common weed in many areas."
