    "intro": "Psychotria callensii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which are followed by small, dark blue to black berries. It is often found growing in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Psychotria callensii is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
