    "intro": "Pilosella peleteriana subsp. subpeleteriana, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and flower morphology. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora of high-altitude environments."
