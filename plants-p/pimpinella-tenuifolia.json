    "intro": "Pimpinella tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved cow-wheat, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with narrow, lance-shaped lobes that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along woodland edges."
