    "intro": "Phacelia lenta, commonly known as blue phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and rocky slopes, often in dry to moist soils. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and erect. Phacelia lenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
