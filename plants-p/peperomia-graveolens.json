    "intro": "Peperomia graveolens, commonly known as the sweet pepper plant, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a distinctively aromatic scent when touched. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia graveolens is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and moderate humidity to flourish."
