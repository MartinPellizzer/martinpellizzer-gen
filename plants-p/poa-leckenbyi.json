    "intro": "Poa leckenbyi, commonly known as the Leckenby's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Poa leckenbyi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
