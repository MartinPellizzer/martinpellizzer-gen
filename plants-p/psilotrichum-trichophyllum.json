    "intro": "Psilotrichum trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, clustered stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Psilotrichum trichophyllum is a primitive vascular plant with a simple structure, reflecting its ancient evolutionary origins."
