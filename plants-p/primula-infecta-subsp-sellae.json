It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where temperatures are cool and sunlight is abundant. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with showy flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters. It produces small, oval fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
