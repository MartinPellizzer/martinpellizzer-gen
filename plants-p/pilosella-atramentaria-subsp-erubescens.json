    "intro": "Pilosella atramentaria subsp. erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely hairy, gray-green foliage and striking red-orange ray florets that contrast with its yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, bristly achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates."
