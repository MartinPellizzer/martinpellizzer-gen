    "intro": "Primula kingii, commonly known as the King's primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to New Zealand. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
