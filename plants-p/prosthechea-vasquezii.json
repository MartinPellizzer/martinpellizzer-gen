    "intro": "Prosthechea vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence with numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant has linear, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prosthechea vasquezii is considered a vulnerable species."
