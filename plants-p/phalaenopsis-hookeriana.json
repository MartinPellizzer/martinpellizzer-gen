It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs and has dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a lip that is often marked with purple or brown. This orchid is valued for its elegant appearance and is commonly cultivated as a decorative plant."
