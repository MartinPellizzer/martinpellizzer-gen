    "intro": "Polyosma aulacocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved polyosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae, which includes camellias and other ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
