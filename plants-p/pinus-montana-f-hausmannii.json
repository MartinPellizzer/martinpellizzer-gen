    "intro": "Pinus montana f. hausmannii, commonly known as the Hausmann's mountain pine, is a botanical variant of the mountain pine species. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically shorter and more clustered compared to the typical mountain pine, contributing to its distinct appearance. This form is native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
