    "intro": "Polygonum \u00d7 ambiguum, commonly known as the hybrid knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense stands. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purplish tinge, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
