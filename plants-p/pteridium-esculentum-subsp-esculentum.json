    "intro": "Pteridium esculentum subsp. esculentum, commonly known as the edible bracken, is a fern species native to various regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. While its young shoots are edible, the plant contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if consumed in large quantities."
