    "intro": "Palisota laxiflora var. annobonensis, commonly known as the Annobon Island fern, is a species native to the island of Annobon in the Gulf of Guinea. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its slender, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with leaves that are pinnately compound and have a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native habitat."
