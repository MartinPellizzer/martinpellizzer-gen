It is characterized by its showy white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a single row along the stem. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are generally gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Pyrethrum leucanthemum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
