    "intro": "Phaca scalaris, commonly known as the scallop fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often adorned with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer months."
