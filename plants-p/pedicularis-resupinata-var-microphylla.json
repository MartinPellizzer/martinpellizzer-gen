    "intro": "Pedicularis resupinata var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, pale pink or white flowers that resemble a slipper, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It is a hemiparasitic species, relying on certain host plants for some of its nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
