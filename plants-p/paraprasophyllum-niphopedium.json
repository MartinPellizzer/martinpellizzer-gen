    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum niphopedium, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to retain moisture and withstand freezing temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
