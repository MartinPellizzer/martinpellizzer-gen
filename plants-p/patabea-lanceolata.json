It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Patabea lanceolata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
