    "intro": "Panicum glutinosum, commonly known as sticky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist to wet soils. Panicum glutinosum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
