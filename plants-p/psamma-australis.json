    "intro": "Psamma australis, commonly known as the Australian sandbur, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which help in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Psamma australis is often found in coastal and inland regions where it contributes to stabilizing sandy soils."
