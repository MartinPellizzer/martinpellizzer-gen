    "intro": "Petamenes vaginifera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a significant weed in agricultural settings. Botanically, it is classified as a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as cotton and hibiscus."
