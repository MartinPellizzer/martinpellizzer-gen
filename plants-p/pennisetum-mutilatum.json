It features fine, silver-blue foliage that turns reddish in the fall, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of 6 to 12 inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Pennisetum mutilatum is drought-tolerant and resistant to pests and diseases, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
