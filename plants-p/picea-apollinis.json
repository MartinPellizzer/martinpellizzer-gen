    "intro": "Picea apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo fir, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are short and stiff. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in subalpine or alpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Picea apollinis is considered a vulnerable species."
