    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba var. proliferum, commonly known as red root or bloodwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a reddish tint and produces clusters of small, reddish-orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, stream banks, and marshes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
