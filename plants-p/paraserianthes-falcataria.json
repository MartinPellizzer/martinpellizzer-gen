    "intro": "Paraserianthes falcataria, commonly known as the mangrove ironwood, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood and its ability to thrive in coastal and brackish water environments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize sandy shorelines and tidal flats. This species is valued for its durable timber and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
