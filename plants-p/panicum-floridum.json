    "intro": "Panicum floridum, commonly known as Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to swampy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Panicum floridum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
