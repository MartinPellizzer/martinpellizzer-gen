It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Palmeria hooglandii is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system to access groundwater."
