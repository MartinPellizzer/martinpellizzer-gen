    "intro": "Pinguicula fontiqueriana, commonly known as the Fontiquerian butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a predator and a plant."
