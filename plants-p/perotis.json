    "intro": "Perotis, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its showy, blue or purple flower heads that resemble misty clouds, hence its common name. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often found in open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Perotis species are native to North America and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. They are generally easy to grow and thrive in full sun with well-drained soil."
