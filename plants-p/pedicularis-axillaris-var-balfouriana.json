    "intro": "Pedicularis axillaris var. balfouriana, commonly known as the alpine monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by insects. This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh mountain climates and its role in local ecosystems."
