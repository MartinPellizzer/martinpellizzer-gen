    "intro": "Pavonia hastata subf. pilosiuscula, commonly known as the silky pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its upright, branched stems. The plant produces showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that are clustered at the tips of the stems, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a soft, hairy texture that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands."
