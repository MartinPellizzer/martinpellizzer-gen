    "intro": "Polystichum edanoi, commonly known as the Edanoi wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Polystichum edanoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
