    "intro": "Penstemon thompsoniae var. desperatus, commonly known as Thompson's beardtongue, is a rare and striking member of the Plantaginaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of western North America, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems adorned with tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
