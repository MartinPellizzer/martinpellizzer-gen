    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata subsp. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
