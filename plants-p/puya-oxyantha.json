    "intro": "Puya oxyantha, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, bearing vibrant red flowers. The plant thrives in cool, sunny environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or mountainous regions. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure. Puya oxyantha is known for its slow growth and long flowering period, making it a unique and eye-catching addition to botanical gardens."
