It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as grasslands and open woodlands. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, hairy seeds in its fruiting bodies. This subshrub is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
