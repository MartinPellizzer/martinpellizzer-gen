    "intro": "Poa curva, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Poa curva is widely used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
