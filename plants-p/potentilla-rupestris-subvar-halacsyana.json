    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris subvar. halacsyana, commonly known as the rock cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to rocky and arid regions of Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant has finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are adapted to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or limestone habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscaping."
