    "intro": "Panax japonicus f. trifoliolatus, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng with three leaflets, is a variant of the Panax genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are valued for their medicinal properties. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
