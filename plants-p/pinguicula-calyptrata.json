    "intro": "Pinguicula calyptrata, commonly known as the Mexican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It features small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or damp soil. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive hood-like structure over the reproductive parts. The species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
