    "intro": "Pleurothallis ambyx, commonly known as the Andean moon orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
