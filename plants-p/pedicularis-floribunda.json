    "intro": "Pedicularis floribunda, commonly known as the yellow monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture. Its spurred petals are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, enhancing its reproductive success. Pedicularis floribunda is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cooler, high-altitude conditions."
