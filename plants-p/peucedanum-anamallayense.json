    "intro": "Peucedanum anamallayense, commonly known as the Anamallay mountain angelica, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Western Ghats in India. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to cool, mountainous climates. Its medicinal properties have been explored in traditional Ayurvedic practices, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic potential. The species is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting."
