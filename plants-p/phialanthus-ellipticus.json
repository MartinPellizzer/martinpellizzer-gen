    "intro": "Phialanthus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pittosporum, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, elliptical leaves that are often glaucous in appearance, giving the plant a distinctive silvery sheen. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
