    "intro": "Pleurothallis panduripetala, commonly known as the panduripetala orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts in controlled environments."
