    "intro": "Psychotria clarendonensis, commonly known as the Clarendon Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to Jamaica. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-white flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within the Caribbean region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
