    "intro": "Physalis longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed ground cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, elongated calyces that enclose the fruit. The fruit, which is typically yellow or orange, matures into a papery husk that splits open to reveal the edible seeds. The plant grows as an annual herb with branching stems and lobed leaves. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible seeds."
