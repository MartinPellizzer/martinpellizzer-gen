    "intro": "Primula glomerata, commonly known as the clustered primrose, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and produces hairy, oval-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. The flowers bloom in early spring, making it a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators."
