    "intro": "Pinguicula bustamanta, commonly known as the Mexican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It is a small, low-growing plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap and digest small insects. Its flowers are typically purple or pink and bloom in spring. Pinguicula bustamanta is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
