    "intro": "Pelexia lindmaniana, commonly known as Lindman\u2019s pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
