It is characterized by its delicate, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, making it a symbol of transience and renewal in Japanese culture. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal beauty. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, thriving in temperate climates. The fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but less commonly cultivated for consumption."
