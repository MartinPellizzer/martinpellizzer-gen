    "intro": "Pachygenium arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny, purple flower heads and a robust, upright stem. The plant has deeply lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
