    "intro": "Proselias, commonly known as golden thread, are low-growing evergreen shrubs native to the Mediterranean region. They are characterized by their delicate, thread-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in clusters. Proselias thrive in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them suitable for rock gardens and borders. Their ornamental value is enhanced by their compact size and ability to form dense mats over time."
