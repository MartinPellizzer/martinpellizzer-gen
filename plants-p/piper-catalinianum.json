    "intro": "Piper catalinianum, commonly known as the Catalina pepper or Catalina pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the island of Catalina off the coast of California, where it thrives in coastal scrub habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of tiny, white to greenish flowers. It produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Due to its limited geographic range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
