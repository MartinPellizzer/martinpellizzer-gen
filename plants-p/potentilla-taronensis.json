    "intro": "Potentilla taronensis, commonly known as the Taronian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla taronensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
