    "intro": "Plantago contorta, commonly known as twisted plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on a slender stem. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in damp woodlands. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
