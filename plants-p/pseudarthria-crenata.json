It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it has adapted to thrive in dry and semi-arid conditions. Pseudarthria crenata is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
