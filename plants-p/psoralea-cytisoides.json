    "intro": "Psoralea cytisoides, commonly known as the mimosa tree, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and coastal areas. Psoralea cytisoides is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
