    "intro": "Phaeocephalum torreyanum, commonly known as Torrey's ghostflower, is a rare and diminutive plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and closely clustered at the base, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
