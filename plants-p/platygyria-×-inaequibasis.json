    "intro": "Platygyria \u00d7 inaequibasis, commonly known as the hybrid rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It is native to regions with rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
