    "intro": "Plantago polyclada, commonly known as narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
