    "intro": "Passiflora tiliifolia, commonly known as the Mexican passionflower, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature a complex arrangement of petals, sepals, and bracts, often in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing small, hard seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate or heart-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong, sometimes aromatic scent. Passiflora tiliifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported sedative properties."
