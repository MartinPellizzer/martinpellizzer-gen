It is native to Mexico and Central America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Potosia species often have hairy leaves and stems, and they produce small, berry-like fruits. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral display."
