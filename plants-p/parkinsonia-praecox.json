    "intro": "Parkinsonia praecox, commonly known as the early Parkinsonia, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects. The bark is often fissured, and the wood is light and soft, used historically by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
