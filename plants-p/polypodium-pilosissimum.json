    "intro": "Polypodium pilosissimum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
