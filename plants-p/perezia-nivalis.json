    "intro": "Perezia nivalis, commonly known as the snow perezia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in cold, alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Perezia nivalis is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
