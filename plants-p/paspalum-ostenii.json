    "intro": "Paspalum ostenii, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to greenish flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Paspalum ostenii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
