    "intro": "Pogogyne douglasii var. multiflora, commonly known as the Douglas's pogogyne, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. This variant is distinguished by its multiple flower clusters, which contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
