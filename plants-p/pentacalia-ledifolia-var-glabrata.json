    "intro": "Pentacalia ledifolia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically smooth and glossy, with a dense, mat-forming structure that helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and well-drained conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
