    "intro": "Pycnostachys urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
