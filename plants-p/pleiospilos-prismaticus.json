    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleiosprios prismaticus, commonly known as the prism flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, angular, and ridged stem that resembles a prism, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the winter months. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
