    "intro": "Panicum miliaceum var. nigrum, commonly known as black millet, is an annual grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like clusters of dark brown to black seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the inflorescence consists of a panicle with numerous spikelets. Black millet is valued for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, making it an important crop in arid regions."
