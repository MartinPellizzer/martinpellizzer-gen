    "intro": "Potentilla neglecta var. decora, commonly known as the Decorated Cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy blooms, which add a touch of elegance to garden landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
