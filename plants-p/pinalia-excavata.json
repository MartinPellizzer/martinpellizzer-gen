    "intro": "Pinalia excavata, commonly known as the Mexican fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Pinalia excavata is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species in semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
