    "intro": "Polypodium reductum, commonly known as the small holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are usually bi-pinnate, with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. Polypodium reductum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
