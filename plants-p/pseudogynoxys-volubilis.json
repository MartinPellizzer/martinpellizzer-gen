It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in capitula, typical of the daisy family. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Pseudogynoxys volubilis is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
