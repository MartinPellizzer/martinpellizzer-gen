    "intro": "Psittacanthus rhynchanthus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that resemble stars. The plant typically thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and form dense mats. The botanical features of Psittacanthus rhynchanthus make it a popular choice for both ornamental aquatic gardens and ecological restoration projects."
