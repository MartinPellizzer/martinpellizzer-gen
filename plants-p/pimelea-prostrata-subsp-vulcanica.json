    "intro": "Pimelea prostrata subsp. vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic pimelea, is a low-growing shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine, short hairs. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in open heathlands and sandy soils."
