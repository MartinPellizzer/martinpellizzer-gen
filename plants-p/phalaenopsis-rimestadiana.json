    "intro": "Phalaenopsis rimestadiana, commonly known as the Rimestadian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom sequentially along the stem. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. This orchid is popular in horticulture due to its long-lasting blooms and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
