    "intro": "Peyotl diffusus, commonly known as the Mexican peyote, is a small, spineless cactus native to the deserts of northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It contains the psychoactive compound mescaline, which is responsible for its hallucinogenic effects. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and has a dense, rounded stem covered in areoles. Peyote is often cultivated in controlled environments due to its legal status and conservation concerns. Its use has deep cultural significance among indigenous communities, particularly in religious ceremonies."
