    "intro": "Poikilospermum cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved poikilospermum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. Its leaves are often hairy and have a rough texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat. Poikilospermum cordifolium is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
