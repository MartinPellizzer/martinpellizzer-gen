It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Psychotria monsalveae is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
