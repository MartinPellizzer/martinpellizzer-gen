    "intro": "Prunus virens var. rufula, commonly known as the red-flowered cherry tree, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus native to Japan. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red blossoms that appear in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens and landscapes. The tree has small, oval leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the autumn, enhancing its seasonal appeal. It typically grows to a moderate height and width, making it suitable for smaller spaces. The fruit, though not commonly consumed, is edible and resembles a small cherry, though it is generally not cultivated for its fruit."
