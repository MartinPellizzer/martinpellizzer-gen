    "intro": "Polygonum affine, commonly known as the smooth knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist soils along streambanks, wetlands, and disturbed sites. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early fall. Polygonum affine is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in wetland habitats."
