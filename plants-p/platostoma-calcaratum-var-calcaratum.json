    "intro": "Platostoma calcaratum var. calcaratum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives on rocky substrates in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its pale to dark gray, leathery thallus that adheres tightly to the surface it grows on. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. It is often found in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure, such as deserts and rocky outcrops. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
