    "intro": "Prunus coccumilia, commonly known as the red-flowered cherry tree, is a species of shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to reddish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to the landscape. The plant produces small, dark red or black berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its overall aesthetic appeal. Prunus coccumilia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight."
