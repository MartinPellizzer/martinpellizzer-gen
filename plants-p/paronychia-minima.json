    "intro": "Paronychia minima, commonly known as the small sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with small, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Paronychia minima is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
