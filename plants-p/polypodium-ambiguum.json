    "intro": "Polypodium ambiguum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It is a perennial fern that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous structure and produces fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Polypodium ambiguum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
