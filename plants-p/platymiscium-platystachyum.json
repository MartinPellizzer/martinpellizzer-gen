    "intro": "Platymiscium platystachyum, commonly known as the broad-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and typically grows as an epiphyte on the branches of trees. The plant has small, ovate leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
