    "intro": "Psidium nutans, commonly known as the hanging guava, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while the bark is smooth and pale gray. Psidium nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits in warmer climates."
