    "intro": "Parietaria nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant or money plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on walls or in rocky crevices. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its allergenic properties can make it a problematic plant in certain settings."
