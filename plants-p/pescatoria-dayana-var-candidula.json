    "intro": "Pescatoria dayana var. candidula, commonly known as the white-flowered pescatoria, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white petals and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are adapted to its unique ecological niche. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near water sources, where it thrives in the understory of dense vegetation. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
