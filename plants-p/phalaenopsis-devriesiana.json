    "intro": "Phalaenopsis devriesiana, commonly known as the Devries' orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a speckled or streaked appearance. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick layer of white or grayish fur. It prefers bright, indirect light and moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
