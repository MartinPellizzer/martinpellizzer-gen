    "intro": "Polypodium palmatum var. obtusum, commonly known as the Japanese mountain fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern native to East Asia, particularly Japan, China, and Korea. The plant features a short, sturdy rhizome with dense, leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and have a slightly curled appearance. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, giving it a lush, feathery texture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
