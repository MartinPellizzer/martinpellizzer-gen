    "intro": "Plantago longissima var. densiuscula, commonly known as the denseleaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its dense, compact rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves. It is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against herbivory. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
