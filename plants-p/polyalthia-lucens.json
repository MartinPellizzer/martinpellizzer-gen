    "intro": "Polyalthia lucens, commonly known as the silver flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its ornamental value comes from its striking floral display and the way it sheds its leaves during the dry season. The tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a shade tree."
