    "intro": "Psoralidium linearifolium var. palodurense, commonly known as the Paloduren sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, typically in spring. This plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
