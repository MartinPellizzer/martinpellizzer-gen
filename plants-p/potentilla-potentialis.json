    "intro": "Potentilla potentialis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in harsh conditions. Potentilla potentialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
