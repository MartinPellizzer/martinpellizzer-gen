    "intro": "Pleiosorbus, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species that are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, often thorny growth habit. The leaves are usually small, leathery, and arranged alternately along the stems. Pleiosorbus species produce showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
