It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that produces vibrant pink or red flowers. The plant has fleshy, thick leaves that help it store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. It blooms throughout the dry season, typically from late winter to early summer. Portulaca somalica is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
