    "intro": "Potentilla taurica f. phrygia, commonly known as the Phrygian potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
