    "intro": "Pyrethrum arassanicum, commonly known as the Armenian pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins. These compounds make it an effective botanical pesticide, particularly against a variety of insect pests. Pyrethrum arassanicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ecological benefits in pest control."
