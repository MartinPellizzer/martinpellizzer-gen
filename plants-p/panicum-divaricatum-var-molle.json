    "intro": "Panicum divaricatum var. molle, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive, silky texture. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green or golden in color. Silky panicgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
