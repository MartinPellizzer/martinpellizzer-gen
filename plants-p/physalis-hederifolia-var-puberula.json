It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped fruits that turn orange when mature, encased in a papery calyx. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators."
