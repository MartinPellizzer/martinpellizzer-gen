    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris procera, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, shield-like appearance due to its tightly clustered fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative propagation."
