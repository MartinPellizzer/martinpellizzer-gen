It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces striking, red and orange inflorescences that are both ornamental and attract pollinators. It thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing in sandy or muddy soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
