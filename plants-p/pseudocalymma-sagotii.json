    "intro": "Pseudocalymma sagotii, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale pink or white petals and sepals. The plant typically grows on limestone outcrops and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native region."
