    "intro": "Pelma ankylorhinon, commonly known as the horned marsh fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like spore-bearing structures that protrude from the fronds, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil to flourish. Its fronds are typically broad and leathery, with a deep green coloration. Pelma ankylorhinon plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
