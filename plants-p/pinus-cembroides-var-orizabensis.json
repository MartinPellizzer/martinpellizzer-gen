    "intro": "Pinus cembroides var. orizabensis, commonly known as the Orizaba pine, is a rare and endemic species native to central Mexico. It is a medium to tall evergreen conifer characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in mountainous regions. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until triggered by heat, such as from a forest fire, to release seeds. This adaptation aids in its reproduction in harsh, fire-prone environments."
