    "intro": "Pyrus arguta, commonly known as the rough apple or sand pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are often rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in late summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Pyrus arguta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its fruit in some regions."
