    "intro": "Penstemon cinereus subsp. typicus, commonly known as the gray beard scale, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces striking spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees further enhance its ecological value."
