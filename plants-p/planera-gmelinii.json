    "intro": "Planera gmelinii, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to tolerate various growing conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
