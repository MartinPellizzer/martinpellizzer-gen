    "intro": "Pedicularis angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and meadows. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often endangered species."
