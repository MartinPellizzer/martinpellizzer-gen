    "intro": "Portulaca anceps, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a low-growing, succulent annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and small, yellow flowers that open in the morning. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its short life cycle allows it to complete its growth and reproduction quickly in harsh conditions."
