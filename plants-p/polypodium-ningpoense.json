    "intro": "Polypodium ningpoense, commonly known as the Ningpo fern, is a species of polypody found in China. It is a small evergreen fern with a rosette-like growth pattern and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium ningpoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
