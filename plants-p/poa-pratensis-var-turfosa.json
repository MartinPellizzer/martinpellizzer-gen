    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. turfosa, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and fine-textured foliage, making it ideal for turfgrass applications. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth pattern, with rhizomes and stolons that help it spread and establish quickly. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires moderate to high levels of moisture and nutrients. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions has made it a popular choice for lawns and sports fields."
