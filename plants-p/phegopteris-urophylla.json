    "intro": "Phegopteris urophylla, commonly known as the giant holly fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a feathery appearance and a dark green, glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, where it can access the high humidity it requires. Phegopteris urophylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be cultivated in shaded gardens with proper moisture conditions."
