    "intro": "Pouteria dura, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, spiny fruits. The fruit contains a single large seed, which is the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in wet, nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in the rainforest by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
