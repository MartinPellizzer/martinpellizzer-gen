    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. hirta, commonly known as hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hirsute (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
