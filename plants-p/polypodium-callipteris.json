    "intro": "Polypodium callipteris, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in a rosette pattern. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself securely in rocky substrates. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green presence throughout the year."
