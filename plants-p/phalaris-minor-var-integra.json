    "intro": "Phalaris minor var. integra, commonly known as sea oats, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their attractive, feathery appearance. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Phalaris minor var. integra plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
