    "intro": "Prenanthes glabra, commonly known as slender burr cucumber, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fruit is a dry, burr-like structure that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Prenanthes glabra is often found in wetlands and is an important part of the local flora in its native habitat."
