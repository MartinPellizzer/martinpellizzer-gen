    "intro": "Piparea, commonly known as the water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and its roots anchor it to the substrate. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Piparea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
