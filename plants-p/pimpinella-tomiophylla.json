    "intro": "Pimpinella tomiophylla, commonly known as the Japanese cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its seeds are small and contained within a burr-like structure, which aids in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Pimpinella tomiophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
