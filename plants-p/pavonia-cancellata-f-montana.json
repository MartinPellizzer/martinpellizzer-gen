    "intro": "Pavonia cancellata f. montana, commonly known as the mountain pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
