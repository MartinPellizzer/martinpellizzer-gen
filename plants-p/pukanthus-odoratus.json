    "intro": "Pukanthus odoratus, commonly known as the sweet puka, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. Pukanthus odoratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fragrance."
