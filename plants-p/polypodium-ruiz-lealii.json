    "intro": "Polypodium ruiz-lealii, commonly known as the Ruiz-Leal's polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
