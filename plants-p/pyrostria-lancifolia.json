    "intro": "Pyrostria lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pyrostria, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
