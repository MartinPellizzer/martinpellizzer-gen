    "intro": "Pinus wrightii, commonly known as the Arizona pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The Arizona pine plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
