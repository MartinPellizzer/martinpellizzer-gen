    "intro": "Pyrus elaeagrifolia var. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-scented fruits that ripen in late summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
