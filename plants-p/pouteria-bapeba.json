    "intro": "Pouteria bapeba, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree's fruit is a woody capsule that contains up to 20 edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium and healthy fats. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its habitat and is also economically important for its nut production."
