    "intro": "Pantocsekia illyrica, commonly known as the Illyrian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stem is erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
