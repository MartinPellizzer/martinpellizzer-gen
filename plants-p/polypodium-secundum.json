    "intro": "Polypodium secundum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its wiry, climbing stems and its ability to attach itself to trees and other structures. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, often arching growth habit. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
