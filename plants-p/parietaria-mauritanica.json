    "intro": "Parietaria mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania wall-rocket, is a flowering plant native to North Africa and the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. It is often found growing in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry, arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
