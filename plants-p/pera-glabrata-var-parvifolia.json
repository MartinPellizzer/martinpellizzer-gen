    "intro": "Pera glabrata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved pera, is a compact shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
