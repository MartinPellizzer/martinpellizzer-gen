    "intro": "Phaius amboinensis var. papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan spathiphyllum, is a species of orchid native to New Guinea and surrounding islands. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale green spathe that surrounds a yellowish spadix. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowering season usually occurs during the wet season, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
