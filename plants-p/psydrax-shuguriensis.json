    "intro": "Psydrax shuguriensis, commonly known as the Shuguri sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody bark and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It is valued for its timber and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
