    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subvar. brachyptera, commonly known as the short-stalked milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, often pale flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are opposite and usually have a hairy texture, while its flowers are arranged in clusters. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within its native range."
