    "intro": "Picea likiangensis subsp. balfouriana, commonly known as the Yunnan fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, often growing in mixed forests with other conifer species. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in its native habitat."
