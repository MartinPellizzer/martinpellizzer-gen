    "intro": "Pitcairnia bromeliifolia var. wynteri, commonly known as the Wytner's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, fibrous mat of white to pale green trichomes. The plant produces strikingly colorful inflorescences with vibrant red, orange, or yellow bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
