    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea f. genevensis, commonly known as the grey cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe. It features small, five-petaled white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
