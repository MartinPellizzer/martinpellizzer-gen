It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible pears that ripen in late summer. Its fruit is characterized by a rough, brown skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. Pyrus syriaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
