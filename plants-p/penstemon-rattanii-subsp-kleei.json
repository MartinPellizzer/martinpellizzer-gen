    "intro": "Penstemon rattanii subsp. kleei, commonly known as Klee's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, hairy stems and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a grayish or blue-green hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
