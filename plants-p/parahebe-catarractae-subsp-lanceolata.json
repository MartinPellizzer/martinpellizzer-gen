    "intro": "Parahebe catarractae subsp. lanceolata, commonly known as the lance-leaf parahebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and streamside habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native insect populations."
