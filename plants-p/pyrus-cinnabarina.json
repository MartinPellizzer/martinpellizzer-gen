    "intro": "Pyrus cinnabarina, commonly known as the red-leafed pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its smooth, grey bark. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to common pears. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Pyrus cinnabarina thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, requiring moderate water and care."
