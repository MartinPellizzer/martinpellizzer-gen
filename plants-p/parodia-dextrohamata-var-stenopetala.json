    "intro": "Parodia dextrohamata var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Africa. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in dense, white to pale green areoles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance."
