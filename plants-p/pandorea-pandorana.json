It is characterized by its fragrant, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces long, twisting vines that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters. Its botanical features include opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
