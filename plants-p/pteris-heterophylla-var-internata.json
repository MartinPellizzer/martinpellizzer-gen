    "intro": "Pteris heterophylla var. internata, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic and terrestrial gardens. The plant's ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
