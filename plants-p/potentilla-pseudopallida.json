    "intro": "Potentilla pseudopallida, commonly known as the whitecinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features wiry stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Potentilla pseudopallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
