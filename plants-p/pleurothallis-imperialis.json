    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis imperialis, commonly known as the Imperial Pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically has a short, stocky stem with few leaves and blooms during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
