    "intro": "Phlegmariurus carinatus, commonly known as the ridge moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a dense, cushion-like growth form and a central ridge that gives it its common name. Its leaves are closely arranged and often have a waxy coating, which helps in retaining moisture. Phlegmariurus carinatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
