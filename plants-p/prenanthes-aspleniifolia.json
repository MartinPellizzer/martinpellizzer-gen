    "intro": "Prenanthes aspleniifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved water hemlock, is a member of theApiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for true ferns, but it is actually a flowering plant. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a characteristic feature of the carrot family. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to both animals and humans."
