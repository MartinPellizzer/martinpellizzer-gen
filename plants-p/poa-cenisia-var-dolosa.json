    "intro": "Poa cenisia var. dolosa, commonly known as the Dolosa bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass genus native to certain regions of Europe. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
