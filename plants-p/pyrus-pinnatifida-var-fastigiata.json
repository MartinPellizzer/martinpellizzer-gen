It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits in late summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant form and seasonal interest. This variety is relatively cold-hardy and suitable for smaller garden spaces."
