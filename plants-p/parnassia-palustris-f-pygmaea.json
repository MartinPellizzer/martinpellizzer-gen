    "intro": "Parnassia palustris f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf ladies' smock, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in northern regions. It features delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems are short and often bend over, with fewer flowers than the typical form of Parnassia palustris. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller size and is often found in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
