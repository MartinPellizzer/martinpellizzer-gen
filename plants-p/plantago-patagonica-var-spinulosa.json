    "intro": "Plantago patagonica var. spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny plantain, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves with distinctive spines along the margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
