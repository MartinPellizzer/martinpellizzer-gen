It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark that provides protection against environmental stressors. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with well-drained soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pale underside. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
