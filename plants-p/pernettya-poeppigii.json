    "intro": "Pernettya poeppigii, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black in color. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with dense, needle-like leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Pernettya poeppigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide food for wildlife in its natural habitat."
