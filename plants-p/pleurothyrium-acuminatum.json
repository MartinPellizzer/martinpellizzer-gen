    "intro": "Pleurothyrium acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes that help it anchor to submerged substrates. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly notched. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
