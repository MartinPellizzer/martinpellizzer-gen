    "intro": "Polygonum pensylvanicum var. oneillii, commonly known as O\u2019Neil\u2019s smartweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, hairless stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition from white to pink as they mature, typically blooming from June to September. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in wetlands, ditches, and woodland edges. O\u2019Neil\u2019s smartweed is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
