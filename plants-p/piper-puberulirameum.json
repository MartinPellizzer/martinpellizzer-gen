It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often glandular and emit a mild, peppery scent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, typically in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
