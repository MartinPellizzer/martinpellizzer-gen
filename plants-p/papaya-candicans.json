    "intro": "Papaya candicans, commonly known as the common papaya, is a tropical plant belonging to the Caricaceae family. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and a fleshy, orange-colored fruit that is rich in vitamin C. The plant is native to Central America and the Caribbean but is now cultivated in many tropical regions worldwide. Its fruit is not only delicious but also has medicinal properties due to the presence of papain, an enzyme used in digestion. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
