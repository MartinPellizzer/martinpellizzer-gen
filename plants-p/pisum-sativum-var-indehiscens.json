    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. indehiscens, commonly known as the runner bean, is a variant of the common pea that features pods that do not open naturally. This trait is due to a genetic mutation that prevents the pod from splitting, which can be advantageous for seed retention and harvest. The plant is a climbing legume with compound leaves and small, white or pink flowers. It produces edible pods that contain seeds, often used in culinary applications. This variety is cultivated for its nutritious beans and is well-suited to temperate climates."
