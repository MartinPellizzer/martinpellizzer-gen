    "intro": "Phlegmariurus tico, commonly known as the Tico clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with whorls of small, scale-like leaves that contribute to its dense, mat-like growth form. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, releasing them from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This species is adapted to thrive in humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
