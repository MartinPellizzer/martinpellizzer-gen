    "intro": "Panicum virgatum var. breviramosum, commonly known as inland sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, silver-green leaves and produces fluffy, white to beige seed heads that resemble small clouds. The plant thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
