It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, reaching a height of only a few centimeters. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a narrow, dry legume that splits open to release tiny seeds. Botanically, it belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic compounds and umbellate inflorescence."
