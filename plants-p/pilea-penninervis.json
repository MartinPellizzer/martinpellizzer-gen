    "intro": "Pilea penninervis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features round, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive, almost coin-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea penninervis is popular as a decorative indoor plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
