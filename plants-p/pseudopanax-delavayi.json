    "intro": "Pseudopanax delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's silver tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
