It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe down the center. The plant produces strap-like, grassy leaves that are evergreen in mild climates and die back in colder regions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers.
