It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing in shaded, humid environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
