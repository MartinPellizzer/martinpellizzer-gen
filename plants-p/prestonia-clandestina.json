    "intro": "Prestonia clandestina, commonly known as the hidden prestonia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related genera. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are usually covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prestonia clandestina is considered a rare and endangered species."
