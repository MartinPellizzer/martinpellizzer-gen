    "intro": "Psittacanthus longerectus, commonly known as the long-stalked cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in moist, shaded environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
