    "intro": "Pogonospermum scabridum, commonly known as the rough pogonospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often hairy and have a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters that attract various pollinators."
