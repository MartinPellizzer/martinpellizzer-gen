It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters called cymes. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Prenanthes raphanifolia is a perennial herb that is both ecologically significant and sometimes considered a weed."
