It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
