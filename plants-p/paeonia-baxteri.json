    "intro": "Paeonia baxteri, commonly known as the Baxter peony, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It belongs to the\u828d\u836f\u5c5e (Paeoniaceae) family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has palmate leaves and produces large, fleshy roots that are historically used in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paeonia baxteri is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
