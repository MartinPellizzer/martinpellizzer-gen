    "intro": "Ptychotis rigens, commonly known as the rigid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Ptychotis rigens is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
