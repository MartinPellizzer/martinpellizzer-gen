    "intro": "Panterpa prieurii, commonly known as the Prieur's panther orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often colorful flowers that resemble the patterns of a panther's coat, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives on the nutrients provided by decaying organic matter. Its flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Panterpa prieurii is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
