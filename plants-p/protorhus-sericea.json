    "intro": "Protorhus sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The silverleaf tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
