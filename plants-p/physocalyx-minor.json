    "intro": "Physocalyx minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a small herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams and in swampy areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health."
