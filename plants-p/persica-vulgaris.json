    "intro": "Persica vulgaris, commonly known as the common peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers in early spring, followed by fuzzy, orange-red fruits called peaches. Persica vulgaris thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental and fruit-bearing plant. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
