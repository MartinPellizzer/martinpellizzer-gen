    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. muscata, commonly known as the Muscat peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its aromatic, sweet fruit. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree with alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy underside. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in clusters, and the fruit develops from the fertilized flower, ripening in late summer. The Muscat peach is prized for its unique musky fragrance and juicy, flavorful pulp. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and its edible fruit."
