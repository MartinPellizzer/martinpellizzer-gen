    "intro": "Phagnalon tibesticum, commonly known as the Tibetan phagnalon, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, cushion-like growth form to reduce water loss. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in dense heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Phagnalon tibesticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
