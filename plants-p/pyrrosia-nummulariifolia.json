    "intro": "Pyrrosia nummulariifolia, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features small, shield-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates. The fronds are usually clustered closely together, forming a dense, compact growth pattern."
