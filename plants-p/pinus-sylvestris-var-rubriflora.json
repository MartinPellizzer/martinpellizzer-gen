    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown cones, which contrast with the typical greenish-brown cones of the standard species. The plant is a coniferous evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across Scandinavia and the British Isles. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
