    "intro": "Pleopeltis fuscopunctata, commonly known as the spotted tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft glow in the dark. The plant has a unique ability to absorb and store light, which contributes to its glowing appearance. Its fronds are typically dark green with distinctive brown spots, giving it a striking visual contrast. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
