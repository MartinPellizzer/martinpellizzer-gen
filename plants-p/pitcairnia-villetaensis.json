    "intro": "Pitcairnia villetaensis, commonly known as the Villeta's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically stiff and covered in fine trichomes, which help in water retention. Pitcairnia villetaensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments."
