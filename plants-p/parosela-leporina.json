    "intro": "Parosela leporina, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that resemble the paw prints of a hare. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or forest floors. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela leporina is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
