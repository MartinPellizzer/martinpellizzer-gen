    "intro": "Psilocarya conferta, commonly known as the dense-hairy psilocybe, is a species of psychedelic mushroom belonging to the genus Psilocybe. It is characterized by its dense, hairy cap that is typically ochre to brown in color, and a slender, tapering stem. The gills are closely spaced and initially pale, turning a deep reddish-brown as the mushroom matures. The spores are small and ellipsoid, with a smooth surface, and are released in a cloud-like pattern. This species is often found in grassy areas and is closely related to other psilocybin-containing mushrooms."
