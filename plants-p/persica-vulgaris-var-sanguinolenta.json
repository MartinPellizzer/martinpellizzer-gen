    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. sanguinolenta, commonly known as the blood-red peach. This variant is characterized by its striking deep red to almost black foliage, which contrasts vividly with its pale green stems. The leaves are typically ovate with a slightly serrated margin, and the plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring. It is a compact shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. While not a fruit-bearing variety, it is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
