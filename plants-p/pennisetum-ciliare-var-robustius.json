    "intro": "Pennisetum ciliare var. robustius, commonly known as stiff beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and coarse, stiff leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. This grass is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
