    "intro": "Pseudoponera punctulata, commonly known as the punctured ponerine ant, is a species of ant belonging to the family Poneridae. It is characterized by its slender body and distinct punctures on its exoskeleton, which give it its common name. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this ant plays a role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling through its foraging activities. The species exhibits solitary nesting behavior, often constructing small, shallow nests in moist soil or leaf litter. Its diet primarily consists of small invertebrates, and it is known for its aggressive defense behavior when threatened."
