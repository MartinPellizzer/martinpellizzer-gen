    "intro": "Peperomia pukooana, commonly known as the Hawaiian peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Hawaii. It features small, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia pukooana is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and compact growth habit."
