The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into bi- or tri-pinnate structures. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and have a leathery texture, with a dark green coloration. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
