    "intro": "Puccinellia \u00d7 harmseniana, commonly known as the hybrid glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline and coastal environments. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Puccinellia tenuiflora and Puccinellia attenuata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding its survival in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
