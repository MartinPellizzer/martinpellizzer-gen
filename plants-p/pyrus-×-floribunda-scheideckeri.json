    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 floribunda scheideckeri, commonly known as the Japanese white pear, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a range of botanical characteristics. It is a deciduous tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of 2 to 6 meters, with a dense, rounded canopy. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a pear-like apple, usually yellow or green, and is edible, though often used for ornamental purposes rather than culinary use."
