    "intro": "Physaria palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, inflated pods that resemble bladders, hence its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Physaria palmeri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
