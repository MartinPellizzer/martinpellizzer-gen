    "intro": "Psammoseris senecioides, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss, while its flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters. Psammoseris senecioides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects."
