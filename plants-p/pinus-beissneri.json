    "intro": "Pinus beissneri, commonly known as the Beissner's pine, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and distinctive cone structures. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and release seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
