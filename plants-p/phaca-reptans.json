    "intro": "Phaca reptans, commonly known as the creeping phaca, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Phaca reptans thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
