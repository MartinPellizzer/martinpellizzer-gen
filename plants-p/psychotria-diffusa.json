    "intro": "Psychotria diffusa, commonly known as the \"devil's breath,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Psychotria diffusa is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
