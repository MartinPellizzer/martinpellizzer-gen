    "intro": "Phlomoides paniculata, commonly known as narrowleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides."
