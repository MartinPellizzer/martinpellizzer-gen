    "intro": "Psychotria attenuata, commonly known as Ayahuasca or the \"plant of the dead,\" is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant contains the psychoactive alkaloid dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which is responsible for its hallucinogenic effects. It is often used in traditional shamanic practices for spiritual and healing purposes. The plant's botanical significance is further enhanced by its role in the preparation of Ayahuasca brews."
