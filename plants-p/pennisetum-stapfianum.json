    "intro": "Pennisetum stapfianum, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white seed heads that are highly ornamental and attract birds and insects. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Pennisetum stapfianum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
