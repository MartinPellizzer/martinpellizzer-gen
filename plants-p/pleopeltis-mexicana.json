    "intro": "Pleopeltis mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Pleopeltis mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
