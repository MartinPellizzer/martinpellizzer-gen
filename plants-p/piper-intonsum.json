    "intro": "Piper intonsum, commonly known as the black pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its long, climbing stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into the familiar black, white, and green peppercorns used globally in cuisine and medicine. Its fruit, the peppercorn, is the primary part harvested for its aromatic and pungent properties. Piper intonsum thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
