It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China and Vietnam. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are typically long-lasting, blooming in clusters that can persist for several months. The varietal form 'aurea' is distinguished by its vivid golden coloration, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
