    "intro": "Pedicularis pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which includes over 400 species of flowering plants, many of which are hemiparasitic. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by insects. The leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
