    "intro": "Pycnophyllum kobalanthum, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually narrow and succulent to reduce water loss. It is adapted to withstand high salinity and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. The plant plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
