    "intro": "Persea dulcis, commonly known as the avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It produces a large, pear-shaped fruit with a smooth, green skin and a creamy, nutrient-rich pulp. The fruit contains a single large seed, or pit, surrounded by the edible part. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
