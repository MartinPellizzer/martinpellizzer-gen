    "intro": "Polycarpon polycarpoides subsp. bivonae, commonly known as the bivonae sandparsley, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, lanceolate leaves. The flowers are typically pale green to yellow, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
