    "intro": "Pavetta crebrifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are typically fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
