    "intro": "Peritassa rubicunda, commonly known as the red-hued orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a contrasting green or yellow throat. The plant has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Peritassa rubicunda thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for collectors and botanical gardens."
