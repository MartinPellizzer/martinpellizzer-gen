    "intro": "Pavonia burchellii subsp. craspedocarpa, commonly known as the red sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features prostrate stems that form a dense mat, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
