    "intro": "Peristylus latilobus, commonly known as the broad-lobed peristylus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual or perennial, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a broad, fleshy texture, and the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Peristylus latilobus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
