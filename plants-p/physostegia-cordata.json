    "intro": "Physostegia cordata, commonly known as the narrowleaf blueflag, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils. Physostegia cordata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and aesthetic value."
