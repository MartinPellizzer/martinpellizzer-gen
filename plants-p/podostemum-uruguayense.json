    "intro": "Podostemum uruguayense, commonly known as the Uruguay water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often clustered at the water's surface. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically short-lived and pollinated by insects. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in submerged substrates, and it thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
