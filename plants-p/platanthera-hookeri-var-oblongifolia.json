    "intro": "Platanthera hookeri var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a loose raceme, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
