    "intro": "Phlogacanthus changlangensis, commonly known as the Changlang sandalwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically found in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in India. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its unique scent and durability. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical climates at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth margin, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phlogacanthus changlangensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and overexploitation."
