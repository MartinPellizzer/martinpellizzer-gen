    "intro": "Plantago atrata subsp. spadicea, commonly known as the yellow plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender spikes. Its fibrous root system makes it adaptable to a variety of soil types, including disturbed or sandy soils. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, contributing to its widespread distribution."
