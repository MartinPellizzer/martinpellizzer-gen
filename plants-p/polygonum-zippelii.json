    "intro": "Polygonum zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along streambanks and in wet meadows. Polygonum zippelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
