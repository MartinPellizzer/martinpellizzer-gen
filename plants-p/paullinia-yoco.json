    "intro": "Paullinia yoco, commonly known as the Amazonian coffee or yoco, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to red when mature, containing several seeds. It is valued for its unique caffeine content, which is similar to that of coffee but with a distinct flavor profile. Due to its habitat in the Amazon, it is often found in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil."
