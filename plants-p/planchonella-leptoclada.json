    "intro": "Planchonella leptoclada, commonly known as the slender-leaved sandpaper fig, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, smooth-skinned fruits that are typically yellow when ripe. It thrives in humid, lowland environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
