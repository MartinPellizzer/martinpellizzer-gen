    "intro": "Pinus abies var. obovata, commonly known as the Norway spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to northern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles that are typically two to three centimeters long, and its distinctive cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, seed-containing structures that release seeds when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in horticulture and as a source of timber due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
