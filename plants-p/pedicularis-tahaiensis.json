    "intro": "Pedicularis tahaiensis, commonly known as the Tahai lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which includes over 450 species of flowering plants, many of which are hemiparasitic. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically red or orange in color, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant's root system is specialized to absorb nutrients from nearby plants, reflecting its parasitic nature."
