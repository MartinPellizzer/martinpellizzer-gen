It is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The plant features delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, often covered in fine hairs.
