The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers well-drained, moist soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
