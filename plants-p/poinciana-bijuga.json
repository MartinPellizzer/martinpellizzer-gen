    "intro": "Poinciana bijuga, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, five-petaled white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, humid climates."
