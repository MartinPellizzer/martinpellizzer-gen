    "intro": "Paronychia patula, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from deep within the soil. Paronychia patula is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
