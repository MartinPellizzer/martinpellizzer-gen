    "intro": "Paranecepsia alchorneifolia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant's botanical structure reflects its resilience to drought and its evolutionary adaptation to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
