    "intro": "Pittosporum lanipetalum, commonly known as the New Zealand pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features dense, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
