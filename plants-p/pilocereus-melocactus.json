It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering behavior."
