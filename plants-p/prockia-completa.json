    "intro": "Prockia completa, commonly known as the complete prockia, is a rare and intriguing plant species that belongs to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Prockia completa is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
