    "intro": "Phylogyne triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed phylog, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates. Due to habitat loss, Phylogyne triloba is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
