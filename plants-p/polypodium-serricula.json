    "intro": "Polypodium serricula, commonly known as the serrated wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of spore-bearing leaves. Polypodium serricula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
