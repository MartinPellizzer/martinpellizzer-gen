    "intro": "Pteris bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbiferous water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. One of its unique features is the production of bulbils, which are small, plant-like structures that can grow into new plants. This adaptation aids in its propagation and survival in various habitats."
