    "intro": "Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones containing edible seeds surrounded by a woody covering. Its needles are flat, dark green, and arranged in spirals along the branches. The bark is thick, furrowed, and becomes deeply ridged with age, providing protection against wildfires."
