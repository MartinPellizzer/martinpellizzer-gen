It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that open at night. The plant has a slender, twining stem with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs."
