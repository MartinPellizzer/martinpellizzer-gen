It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and are often covered in fine hairs. Parietaria suffruticosa is known for its ability to thrive in rocky or disturbed soils, making it a common weed in gardens and along pathways."
