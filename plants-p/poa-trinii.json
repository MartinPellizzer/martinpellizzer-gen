    "intro": "Poa trinii, commonly known as the Trin's bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, carpet-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its leaves are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa trinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes."
