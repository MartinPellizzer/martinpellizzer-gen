    "intro": "Palmorchis colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian palm orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
