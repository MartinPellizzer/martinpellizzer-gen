It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that surround the flower heads, giving it a striking appearance. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in saline and sandy environments. Passaea species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their hardy nature and visual appeal. The flowers are usually blue or purple, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn."
