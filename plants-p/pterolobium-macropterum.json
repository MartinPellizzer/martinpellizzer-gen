It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with elongated, often winged leaflets, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Pterolobium macropterum is often found in open woodlands and savannas, where it contributes to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
