    "intro": "Phaius baolocensis, commonly known as the Baoloc orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil and decomposing organic matter. The orchid plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting biodiversity."
