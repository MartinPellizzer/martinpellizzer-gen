    "intro": "Pleopeltis crenatopinnata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually light green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
