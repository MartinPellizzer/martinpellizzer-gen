    "intro": "Paracarpaea, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a member of the Nelumbonaceae family. It is a semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow freshwater environments, particularly in the high-altitude lakes of South America. Its striking white or pink flowers bloom during the warmer months, often at dawn, and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant has a distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaf structure that floats on the water's surface. Paracarpaea is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its cultural and spiritual significance among indigenous communities."
