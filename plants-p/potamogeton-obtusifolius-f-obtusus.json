It features elongated, broad leaves that are typically dark green and slightly waxy, adapted for underwater photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by cylindrical, multi-seeded fruits. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its growth is often influenced by water clarity, nutrient levels, and flow rate."
