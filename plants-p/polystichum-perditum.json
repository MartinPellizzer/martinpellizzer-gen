    "intro": "Polystichum perditum, commonly known as the lost wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, bipinnate structure. Polystichum perditum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
