    "intro": "Polystichum meridionale, commonly known as the southern wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, glossy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
