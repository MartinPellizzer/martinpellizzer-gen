    "intro": "Polystichum mauritianum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a tall, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It has a thick, fibrous trunk that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a crown of compound, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its rhizomes produce new shoots, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense thickets. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
