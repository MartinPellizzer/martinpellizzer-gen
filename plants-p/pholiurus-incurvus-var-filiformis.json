    "intro": "Pholiurus incurvus var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
