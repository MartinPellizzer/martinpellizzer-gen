    "intro": "Phaenopyrum acerifolium, commonly known as the mapleleaf tree, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed, resembling those of maple trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native habitat."
