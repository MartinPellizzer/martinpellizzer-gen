    "intro": "Physalis origanifolia, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or golden berry, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The fruit is a small, yellow-orange berry that ripens in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is valued for its edible fruit, which has a tangy, sweet flavor. It is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, lantern-like fruiting structures."
