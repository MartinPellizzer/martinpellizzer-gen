    "intro": "Pentachaeta exilis var. grayi, commonly known as the gray's pentachaeta, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers are typical of the genus Pentachaeta. This variant is distinguished by its pale grayish-green foliage, which helps it blend into its desert habitat."
