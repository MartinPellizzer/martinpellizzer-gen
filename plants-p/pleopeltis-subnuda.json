    "intro": "Pleopeltis subnuda, commonly known as the naked pleopeltis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and often have a waxy texture. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
