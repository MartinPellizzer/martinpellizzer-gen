    "intro": "Parosela microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf parosela, is a small flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces delicate yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
