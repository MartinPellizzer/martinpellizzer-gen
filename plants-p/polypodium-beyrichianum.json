    "intro": "Polypodium beyrichianum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. The rhizome is thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in soil or rock. It is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas."
