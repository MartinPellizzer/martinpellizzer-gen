    "intro": "Pinus verschaffeltii, commonly known as the Verschaffelt's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and needle-like leaves. The cones of Pinus verschaffeltii are typically small and woody, containing edible seeds that are an important food source for local wildlife. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
