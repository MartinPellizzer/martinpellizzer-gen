    "intro": "Populus repanda, commonly known as the narrowleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. Populus repanda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas."
