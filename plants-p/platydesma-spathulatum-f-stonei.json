    "intro": "Platydesma spathulatum f. stonei, commonly known as the stonei form of the broad-leafed flat fern, is a rare and specialized fern species. It is characterized by its broad, flat, and often leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and dense clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically niche species."
