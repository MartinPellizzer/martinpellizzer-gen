    "intro": "Potentilla microphylla var. tapetodes, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
