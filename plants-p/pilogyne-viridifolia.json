    "intro": "Pilogyne viridifolia, commonly known as the green-leafed fern, is a tropical plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically a vibrant green, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its leaves are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait in the plant kingdom. Pilogyne viridifolia thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
