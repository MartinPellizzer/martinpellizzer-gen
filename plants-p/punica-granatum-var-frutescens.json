    "intro": "Punica granatum var. frutescens, commonly known as the dwarf pomegranate, is a compact, shrub-like variety of the pomegranate plant. It features small, rounded leaves and produces vibrant red flowers that give way to ornamental, seed-filled fruits. This variety is typically smaller than the standard pomegranate, making it suitable for container gardening or small spaces. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its decorative flowers and fruits."
