    "intro": "Pedicularis lunata, commonly known as the moonflower or lunar orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers open at night, releasing a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of its natural habitat."
