    "intro": "Primula advena var. concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, with a dense cluster of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often preceding the foliage, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other early-season insects. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early blooming display."
