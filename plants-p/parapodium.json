    "intro": "Parapodium, commonly known as the dorsal appendage in certain marine invertebrates, is a specialized structure composed of cilia and muscle fibers. It is primarily found in organisms such as polychaete worms and some species of flatworms. The parapodium functions in locomotion, aiding in the movement through water by generating thrust. It also plays a role in respiration and sensory perception in some species. Botanically, while not a plant structure, it is often studied in the context of comparative anatomy and evolutionary biology."
