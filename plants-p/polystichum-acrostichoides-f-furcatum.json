    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides f. furcatum, commonly known as the forked shield fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that often exhibit a forked or branched appearance, giving it its specific epithet \"furcatum.\" The fronds are typically dark green and leathery, with a rough, serrated margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus to which it belongs."
