    "intro": "Peperomia fraseri, commonly known as the Frost Plant or Frosty Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish hue, often with a frost-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green or red, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia fraseri is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
