These plants are characterized by their distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, often red or purple flowers. Many species are annual or perennial herbs, often found in moist or wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. They have a widespread distribution across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Some species are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their vibrant foliage and flowering habits."
