    "intro": "Platanthera tipuloides, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in North America. It features a tall, flowering stem with a dense spike of pale green to white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, club-shaped pseudobulbs that store nutrients. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. The species is pollinated primarily by flies, which are attracted to its strong scent and nectar-rich flowers."
