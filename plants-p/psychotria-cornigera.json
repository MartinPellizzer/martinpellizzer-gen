    "intro": "Psychotria cornigera, commonly known as the \"Crimson Beauty\" or \"Red Psychotria,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species, many of which are known for their ornamental value. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that range from dark green to almost black in color. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically appear in clusters, with bright red petals that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Psychotria cornigera is often cultivated in shaded gardens due to its preference for moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade."
