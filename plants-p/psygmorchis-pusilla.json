    "intro": "Psygmorchis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and grasslands. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few narrow leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
