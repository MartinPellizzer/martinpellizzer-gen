    "intro": "Polystachya cultriformis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread across forest floors. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, blade-like segments with a glossy green upper surface. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coniferous forests."
