    "intro": "Polystichum virescens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters over time. The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging each spring and maturing throughout the growing season."
