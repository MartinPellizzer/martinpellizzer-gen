    "intro": "Polyachyrus gayi, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in certain environments."
