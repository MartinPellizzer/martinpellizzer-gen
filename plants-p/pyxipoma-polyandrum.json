    "intro": "Pyxipoma polyandrum, commonly known as the black root gall midge, is a small fly species whose larvae induce galls on the roots of certain grasses. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for this insect, which forms distinctive, tumor-like growths on the root systems. These galls are composed of modified plant tissues that provide shelter and nutrients to the developing larvae. The plant's response to the gall-forming insect is a fascinating example of plant-insect interaction. Pyxipoma polyandrum is primarily found in temperate regions where its host grasses are abundant."
