    "intro": "Protohopea tinctoria, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and aerial roots, which help it survive in brackish water environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, and it produces dark, fleshy berries that contain its seeds. Protohopea tinctoria plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
