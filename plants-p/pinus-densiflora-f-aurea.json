    "intro": "Pinus densiflora f. aurea, commonly known as the golden lace pine, is a cultivar of the Japanese black pine. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its dark green needles. This ornamental variation exhibits a more open, spreading growth habit compared to the typical species. The leaves are shorter and more densely packed, creating a unique, lace-like appearance. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and adaptability to various soil types."
