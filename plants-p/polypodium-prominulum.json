    "intro": "Polypodium prominulum, commonly known as the prominent wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that often form a rosette shape, allowing it to cling to tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, enabling it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
