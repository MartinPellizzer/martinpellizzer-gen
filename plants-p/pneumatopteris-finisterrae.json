    "intro": "Pneumatopteris finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that exhibit a unique combination of morphology and physiology adapted to its coastal habitat. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in moist, rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are positioned on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
