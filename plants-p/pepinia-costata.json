    "intro": "Pepinia costata, commonly known as the mountain peperomia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters. Pepinia costata is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
