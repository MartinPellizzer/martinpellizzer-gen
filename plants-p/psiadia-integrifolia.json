    "intro": "Psiadia integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive seed heads that resemble those of the common dandelion. Psiadia integrifolia is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
