    "intro": "Prasophyllum milfordense, commonly known as the Milford leek orchid, is an endemic orchid species found in the South Island of New Zealand. It is a small, terrestrial plant with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of pale green to brownish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming during the late autumn to early spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
