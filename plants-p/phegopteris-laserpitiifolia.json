    "intro": "Phegopteris laserpitiifolia, commonly known as the yellow cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are usually bright yellow to golden in color. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded forest environments, often on cliffs or in crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Phegopteris laserpitiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and light requirements."
