    "intro": "Pilosella auriculoides subsp. tanythrix, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular surface that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to tolerate dry conditions."
