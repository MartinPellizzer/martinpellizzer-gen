    "intro": "Pellaea andromedifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right environmental conditions."
