    "intro": "Princea, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These trees are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their showy, often red or orange, bract-based inflorescences that resemble flames. The leaves are typically palmately compound, with several leaflets radiating from a central point. Princea species are valued for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in warm climates for their vibrant floral displays."
