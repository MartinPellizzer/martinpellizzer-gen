    "intro": "Pocockia cretica, commonly known as the Cretaceous fern, is a fossilized plant that provides valuable insights into ancient ecosystems. It belongs to the family Pterobranchiata, which is closely related to modern ferns and liverworts. The plant's structure reveals complex frond arrangements, indicating its adaptation to early terrestrial environments. Fossil records of Pocockia cretica date back to the Cretaceous period, approximately 145 to 66 million years ago. Its study helps scientists understand the evolutionary transition from aquatic to land-based plant life."
