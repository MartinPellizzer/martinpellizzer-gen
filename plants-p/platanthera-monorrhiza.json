    "intro": "Platanthera monorrhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll in its leaves, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
