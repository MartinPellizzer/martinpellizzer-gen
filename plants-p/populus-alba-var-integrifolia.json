    "intro": "Populus alba var. integrifolia, commonly known as the white poplar with smooth leaves, is a variant of the white poplar species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its white to grey bark, which peels in thin, papery layers, and its opposite, broadly ovate leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and in open woodlands. This variety is notable for its rapid growth and adaptability to a range of environmental conditions."
