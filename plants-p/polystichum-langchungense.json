    "intro": "Polystichum langchungense, commonly known as the Langchung fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
