    "intro": "Pneumatopteris pergamacea, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, large, and leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with a smooth, almost parchment-like texture that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
