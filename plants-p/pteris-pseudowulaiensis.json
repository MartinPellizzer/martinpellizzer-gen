    "intro": "Pteris pseudowulaiensis, commonly known as the Wulai spleenwort, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
