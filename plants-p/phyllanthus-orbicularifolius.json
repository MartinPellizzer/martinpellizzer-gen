    "intro": "Phyllanthus orbicularifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (round) leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
