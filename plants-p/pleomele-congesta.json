    "intro": "Pleomele congesta, commonly known as the clustered flaxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit with fleshy, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional Hawaiian culture for their fibrous texture and aromatic properties. Pleomele congesta is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and coastal areas."
