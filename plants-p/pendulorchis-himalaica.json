    "intro": "Pendulorchis himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to anchor in loose soil, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat sensitivity, Pendulorchis himalaica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
