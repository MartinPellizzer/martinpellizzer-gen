    "intro": "Panicum miliaceum var. nutans, commonly known as millet grass or prostrate millet, is a herbaceous annual plant native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, branching stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, three-angled seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical use in traditional agriculture."
