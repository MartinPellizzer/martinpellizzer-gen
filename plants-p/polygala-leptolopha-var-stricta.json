    "intro": "Polygala leptolopha var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes."
