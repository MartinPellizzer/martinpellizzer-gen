    "intro": "Peperomia pubifolia, commonly known as the hairy peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features upright stems with oval, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and white, which are followed by small, round berries. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
