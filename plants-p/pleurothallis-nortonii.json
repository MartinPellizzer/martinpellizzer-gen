    "intro": "Pleurothallis nortonii, commonly known as the Norton's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
