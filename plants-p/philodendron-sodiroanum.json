    "intro": "Philodendron sodiroanum, commonly known as the Sodiro's philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically glossy and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and growth habit make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening."
