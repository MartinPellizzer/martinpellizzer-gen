It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps."
