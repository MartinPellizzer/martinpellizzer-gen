    "intro": "Poa aestivalis, commonly known as early meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained environments. Poa aestivalis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
