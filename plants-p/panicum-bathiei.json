    "intro": "Panicum bathiei, commonly known as the African grass or Bathiei grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
