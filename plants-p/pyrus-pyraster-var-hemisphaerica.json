    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster var. hemisphaerica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a variant of the common pear with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Its fruit is a small, oval-shaped pome that ripens to a yellowish color in late summer. This variety is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical horticultural significance."
