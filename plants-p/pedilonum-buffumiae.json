    "intro": "Pedilonum buffumiae, commonly known as the Buffum's pedilonum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pedilonum buffumiae is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
