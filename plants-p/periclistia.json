These plants are typically found in saline or coastal environments, where they thrive in high-salinity soils. Periclistia species are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
