    "intro": "Psammogeton, commonly known as sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming structure and small, often spiny leaves. The flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Psammogeton species are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
