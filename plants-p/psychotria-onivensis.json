    "intro": "Psychotria onivensis, commonly known as the \"devil's weed,\" is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by various bird species. It is notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which has led to its use in traditional and ceremonial practices."
