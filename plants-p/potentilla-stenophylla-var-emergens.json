    "intro": "Potentilla stenophylla var. emergens, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
