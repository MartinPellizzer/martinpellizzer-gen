    "intro": "Prunus spinosa proles subinermis, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible berries. The shrub is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
