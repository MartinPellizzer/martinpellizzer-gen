    "intro": "Panicum dichotomum var. tenue, commonly known as slender dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. It typically features narrow, linear leaves and produces panicles of small, delicate flowers. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. Its growth is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in arid environments. The varietal form 'tenue' distinguishes it by its more refined and slender structure compared to other varieties."
