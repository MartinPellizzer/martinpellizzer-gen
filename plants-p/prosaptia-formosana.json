    "intro": "Prosaptia formosana, commonly known as the Formosan bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive periods of dormancy. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
