    "intro": "Polypodium xiphiopteris, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with horizontal underground stems that help it spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bi-directionally compound, with pairs of pinnae that are lanceolate in shape. Polypodium xiphiopteris thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
