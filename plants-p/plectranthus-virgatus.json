    "intro": "Plectranthus virgatus, commonly known as silver bush or silver leaf, is a shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, gray-green foliage with a silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, fuzzy hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It is evergreen and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. Plectranthus virgatus is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
