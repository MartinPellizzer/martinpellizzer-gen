    "intro": "Panisea bilamellata, commonly known as the two-lamella panisea, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific ecological niches. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features two distinct lamellae or lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate or subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, Panisea bilamellata is considered a species of conservation concern."
