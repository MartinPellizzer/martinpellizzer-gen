    "intro": "Pinus cembra subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf Swiss stone pine, is a subspecies of the stone pine native to the Alps. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, twisted branches. The needles are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the main species, and they are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, edible pine nuts, and its cones are generally smaller than those of the typical stone pine. This subspecies is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain."
