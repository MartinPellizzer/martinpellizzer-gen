    "intro": "Prunus rivularis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy river cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and alternate, ovate leaves that are hairy on both surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that are yellow when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along riverbanks and in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
