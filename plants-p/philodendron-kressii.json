    "intro": "Philodendron kressii, commonly known as the Kressii philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that often feature a distinctive white or silver variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Philodendron kressii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
