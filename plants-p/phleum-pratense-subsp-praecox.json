    "intro": "Phleum pratense subsp. praecox, commonly known as early meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage crop for livestock."
