    "intro": "Plantago berteroi, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The species is valued for its resilience to drought and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
