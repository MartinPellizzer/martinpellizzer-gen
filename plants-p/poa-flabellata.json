    "intro": "Poa flabellata, commonly known as the flannel grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa flabellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and visual interest."
