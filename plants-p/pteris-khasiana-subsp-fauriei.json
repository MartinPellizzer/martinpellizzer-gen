    "intro": "Pteris khasiana subsp. fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water fern, is a terrestrial fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
