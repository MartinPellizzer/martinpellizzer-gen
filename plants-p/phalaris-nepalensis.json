    "intro": "Phalaris nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue or purple flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands at high altitudes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
