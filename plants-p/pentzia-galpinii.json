    "intro": "Pentzia galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's pentzia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentzia galpinii is considered a vulnerable species."
