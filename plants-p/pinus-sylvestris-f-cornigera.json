    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. cornigera, commonly known as the Scottish pine or mountain pine, is a naturally occurring variant of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical Scots pine, often forming dense, shrub-like formations. The foliage is typically darker green and more densely packed, with shorter needles that give it a distinct appearance. It thrives in harsh, alpine or mountainous environments, showing high tolerance to cold and wind. This form is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
