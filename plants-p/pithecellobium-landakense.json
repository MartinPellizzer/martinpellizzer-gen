    "intro": "Pithecellobium landakense, commonly known as the Landakense Pithecellobium, is a species of legume native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated pods containing edible, bean-like seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its potential nutritional value, it has been studied for its role in local agriculture and ecological restoration."
