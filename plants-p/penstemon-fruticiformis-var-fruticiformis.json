    "intro": "Penstemon fruticiformis var. fruticiformis, commonly known as the Mojave penstemon, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
