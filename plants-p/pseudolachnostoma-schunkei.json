    "intro": "Pseudolachnostoma schunkei, commonly known as the Schunke's lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its thin, leathery thallus with a distinctive, pale green to yellowish upper surface and a darker, often granular lower surface. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi. Pseudolachnostoma schunkei is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
