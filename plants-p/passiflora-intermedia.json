    "intro": "Passiflora intermedia, commonly known as the purple passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, which are often mistaken for stamens. The plant produces edible, tropical berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora intermedia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its calming properties."
