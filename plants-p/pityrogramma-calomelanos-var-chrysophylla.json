    "intro": "Pityrogramma calomelanos var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds. The leaves are typically bright yellow to golden in color, which distinguishes it from the more common green variant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a simple rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns."
