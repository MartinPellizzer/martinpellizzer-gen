    "intro": "Pilosella kalksburgensis subsp. praelonga, commonly known as the long-stemmed alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its subspecies designation reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in stem length and leaf structure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized alpine flora."
