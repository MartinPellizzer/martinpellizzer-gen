    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk. It is a cultivar of the Prunus cerasifera species, which is native to southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically white or pink, followed by edible cherries in summer. Its unique form makes it a popular choice for gardens and public spaces, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. The foliage turns a vibrant red in autumn, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
