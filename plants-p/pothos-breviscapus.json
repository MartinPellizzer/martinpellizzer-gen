    "intro": "Pothos breviscapus, commonly known as the short-stemmed pothos, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light to dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Pothos breviscapus is a popular houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive appearance."
