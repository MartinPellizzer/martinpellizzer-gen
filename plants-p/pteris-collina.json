    "intro": "Pteris collina, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions such as China, Japan, and India. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome and produces small, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a continuous line. Pteris collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
