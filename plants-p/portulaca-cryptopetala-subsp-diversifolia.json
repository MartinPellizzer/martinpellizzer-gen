    "intro": "Portulaca cryptopetala subsp. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are typically alternate and may vary in shape, giving rise to its subspecies name *diversifolia*. This species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
