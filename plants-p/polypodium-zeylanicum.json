    "intro": "Polypodium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. The plant thrives in humid environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas effectively."
