    "intro": "Pseudopogonatherum contortum, commonly known as twisted false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively through wetland environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
