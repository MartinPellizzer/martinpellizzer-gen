    "intro": "Pilosocereus vilaboensis subsp. pluricostatus, commonly known as the Shingle Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines, which help to reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in the evening, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from deep underground, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
