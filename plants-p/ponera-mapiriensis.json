    "intro": "Ponera mapiriensis, commonly known as the Mapiri antplant, is a unique species of antplant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leafy structure that provides shelter for colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing for efficient water retention in humid environments. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its specialized relationship with ants, Ponera mapiriensis plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
