    "intro": "Polypodium ruffum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a textured appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically divided into segments and can grow to a considerable size, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and play a key role in its propagation."
