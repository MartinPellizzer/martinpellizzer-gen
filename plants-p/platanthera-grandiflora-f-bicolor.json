    "intro": "Platanthera grandiflora f. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, spiraled stems and dense clusters of pale green to white flowers with a distinctive pink or purple stripe. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and moths, and it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is listed as threatened in several states, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
