    "intro": "Phillyrea latifolia subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental Phillyrea, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
