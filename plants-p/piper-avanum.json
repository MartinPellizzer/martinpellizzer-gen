    "intro": "Piper avanum, commonly known as the Amazonian pepper or wild pepper, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes over 2,000 species of flowering plants. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing the alkaloid piperine, which is responsible for its spicy flavor. Piper avanum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice in local cuisines."
