    "intro": "Phlebodium venosum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a type of epiphytic plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant's rhizomes grow along the surface of trees or other structures, anchoring it without drawing nutrients from its host. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often featuring a distinctive network of veins that contribute to its unique appearance. Phlebodium venosum is well adapted to humid environments and is often found in rainforests where it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat for small organisms."
