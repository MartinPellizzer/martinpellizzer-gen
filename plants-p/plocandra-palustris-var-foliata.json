    "intro": "Plocandra palustris var. foliata, commonly known as the swamp plocandra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, erect stems that often grow up to 60 cm in height, supported by fibrous roots adapted for waterlogged soils. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, contributing to its ecological role in pollination. This plant is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a vital part in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
