    "intro": "Polygonum induratum, commonly known as rough knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Polygonum induratum is known for its resilience and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
