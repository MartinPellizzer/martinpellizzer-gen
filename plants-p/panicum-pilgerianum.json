    "intro": "Panicum pilgerianum, commonly known as the red panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, reddish-brown spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
