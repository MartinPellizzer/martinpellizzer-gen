    "intro": "Pinguicula parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is a low-growing plant that forms dense mats of succulent leaves, which secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically small, rounded, and covered in glandular structures that aid in digestion. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or boggy areas. Pinguicula parvifolia is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats."
