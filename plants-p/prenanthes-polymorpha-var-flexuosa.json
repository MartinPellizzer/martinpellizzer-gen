    "intro": "Prenanthes polymorpha var. flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded or rolled, and it produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along pond edges. Its flexible stems and unique leaf morphology help it withstand flowing water and wind. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
