    "intro": "Peliosanthes sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, a characteristic shared with other members of the Taxaceae family. Peliosanthes sessilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been the subject of conservation efforts due to its declining population. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological and scientific study."
