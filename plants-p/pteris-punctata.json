    "intro": "Pteris punctata, commonly known as the spotted fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated edge and a pale, almost white, midrib. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in humid forests. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Pteris punctata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
