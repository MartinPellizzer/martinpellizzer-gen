    "intro": "Pentanema parietarioides, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it conserve water in harsh environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which reduce transpiration and reflect sunlight. Pentanema parietarioides is often found growing on rocky outcrops and dry soil, making it well adapted to extreme conditions."
