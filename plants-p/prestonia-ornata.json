    "intro": "Prestonia ornata, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Prestonia ornata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
