    "intro": "Portulaca lutea var. howellii, commonly known as Howell's portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that store water, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
