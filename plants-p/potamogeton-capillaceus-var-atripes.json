    "intro": "Potamogeton capillaceus var. atripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are usually dark green to black in color, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes, and it is often found in slow-moving or still waters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
