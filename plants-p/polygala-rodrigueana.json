    "intro": "Polygala rodrigueana, commonly known as Rodrigues' milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and pairs of opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal and sandy habitats, often found in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
