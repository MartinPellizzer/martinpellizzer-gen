    "intro": "Polystichum multifidum f. tipicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a delicate and feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
