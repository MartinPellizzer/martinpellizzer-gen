    "intro": "Pedicularis novaiae-zemliae, commonly known as the Siberian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color, and its ability to grow in nutrient-poor, cold environments. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in alpine and tundra ecosystems."
