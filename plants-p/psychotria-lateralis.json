    "intro": "Psychotria lateralis, commonly known as the \"Hawaiian Psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Psychotria lateralis is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though its ecological role in Hawaiian ecosystems remains understudied."
