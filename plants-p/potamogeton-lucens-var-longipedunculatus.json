It features long, slender leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, which can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with the male flowers typically located above the female ones. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native habitats."
