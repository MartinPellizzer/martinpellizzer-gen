    "intro": "Phreatia sororia var. kenejiana, commonly known as the Kenejian's spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a dense cluster of small, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
