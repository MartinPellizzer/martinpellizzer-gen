    "intro": "Primula orestora, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with hairy surfaces, and it produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Primula orestora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
