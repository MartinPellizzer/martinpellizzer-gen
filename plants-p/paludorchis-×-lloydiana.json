    "intro": "Paludorchis \u00d7 lloydiana, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a natural hybrid between Paludorchis alpina and Paludorchis falcata. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of Europe, particularly in regions with moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, showy white or pale pink flower that blooms in late spring or early summer. Its roots are adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in waterlogged conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
