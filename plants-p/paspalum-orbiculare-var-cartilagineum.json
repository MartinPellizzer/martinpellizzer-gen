    "intro": "Paspalum orbiculare var. cartilagineum, commonly known as the cartilaginous paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray appearance, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small flowers. It is often found in coastal dunes and other arid environments due to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
