    "intro": "Polypodium tenerum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium tenerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
