    "intro": "Paspalum setaceum var. rigidifolium, commonly known as rigid foliaceous paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping or as a forage crop in certain regions."
