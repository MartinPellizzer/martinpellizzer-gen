    "intro": "Parodia piltziorum, commonly known as the Piltziorum cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors."
