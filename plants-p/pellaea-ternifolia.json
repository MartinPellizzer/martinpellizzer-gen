    "intro": "Pellaea ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds are pinnately compound. Pellaea ternifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
