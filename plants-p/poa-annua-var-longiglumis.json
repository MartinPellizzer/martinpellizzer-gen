    "intro": "Poa annua var. longiglumis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a variant of the annual bluegrass species. It is a cool-season grass characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, pale green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is distinctive in appearance. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in turfgrass settings."
