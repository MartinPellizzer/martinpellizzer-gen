It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and medicinal research."
