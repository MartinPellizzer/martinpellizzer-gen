    "intro": "Passiflora shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's passionflower, is a rare and striking species native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-colored flowers that display a mix of blue, purple, and white hues, with intricate patterns resembling a crown. The plant produces edible, tropical berries that are highly sought after for their unique flavor and nutritional value. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Passiflora shaferi is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
