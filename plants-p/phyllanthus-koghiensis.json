    "intro": "Phyllanthus koghiensis, commonly known as the Koghiensis goosefoot, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
