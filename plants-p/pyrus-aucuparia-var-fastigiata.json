    "intro": "Pyrus aucuparia var. fastigiata, commonly known as the columnar crabapple, is a compact, upright shrub or small tree native to Europe. It features narrow, upright growth habit with dense foliage that provides year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart red or yellow fruits in summer. It is well-suited for small gardens and urban landscapes due to its space-efficient form. The leaves are simple, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, adding seasonal color to the landscape."
