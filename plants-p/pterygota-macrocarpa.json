    "intro": "Pterygota macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant winged fern, is a unique plant characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is known for its distinctive fronds that are often divided into numerous smaller leaflets. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, which produce spores for propagation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its size and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
