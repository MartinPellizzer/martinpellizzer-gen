    "intro": "Phylica scandens, commonly known as the silver cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. The plant has a woody stem that can climb or spread along the ground, making it adaptable to various habitats. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Phylica scandens is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
