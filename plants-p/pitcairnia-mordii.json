    "intro": "Pitcairnia mordii, commonly known as the Mordi's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that often display striking colors. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and acuminate, forming a dense rosette that collects water, a common adaptation in bromeliads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia mordii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
