    "intro": "Pseudosassafras laxiflora, commonly known as sweet birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, light-colored bark that exudes a pleasant, vanilla-like scent when exposed to air. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged, samaroid fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, often turning yellow in the fall. Pseudosassafras laxiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats."
