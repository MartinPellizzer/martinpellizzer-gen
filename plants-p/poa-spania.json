    "intro": "Poa spania, commonly known as the Spanish grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces slender, erect stems with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa spania is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and delicate appearance."
