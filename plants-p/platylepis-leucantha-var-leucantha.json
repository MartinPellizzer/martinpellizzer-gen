    "intro": "Platylepis leucantha var. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered flatleaf heath, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
