    "intro": "Prenanthes versicolor, commonly known as the purpletop flower or blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a bluish or purplish hue, while its upper leaves are more narrow and grass-like. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Prenanthes versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
