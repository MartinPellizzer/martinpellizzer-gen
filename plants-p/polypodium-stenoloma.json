    "intro": "Polypodium stenoloma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces spores in sporangia located on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Polypodium stenoloma is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant appearance and ease of care."
