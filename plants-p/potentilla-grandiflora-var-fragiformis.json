    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora var. fragiformis, commonly known as the fragrant potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with silver-gray foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. The variety is distinguished by its more fragrant flowers compared to the typical form of Potentilla grandiflora."
