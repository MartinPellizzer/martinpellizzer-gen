    "intro": "Pinguicula microceras, commonly known as the narrow-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive hood-like structure covering the reproductive organs. Pinguicula microceras is a low-growing species, often forming dense mats that help it thrive in nutrient-poor habitats."
