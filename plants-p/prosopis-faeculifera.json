    "intro": "Prosopis faeculifera, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in adult plants, and its yellowish or pale green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a valuable species for stabilization in degraded landscapes. Its ability to fix nitrogen also contributes to soil fertility in its native environment."
