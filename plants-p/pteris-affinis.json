    "intro": "Pteris affinis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a serrated edge. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in water retention.
