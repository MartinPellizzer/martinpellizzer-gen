    "intro": "Poa sibirica, commonly known as Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Poa sibirica is adapted to withstand harsh winters and is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
