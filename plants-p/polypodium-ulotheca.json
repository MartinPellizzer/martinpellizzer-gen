    "intro": "Polypodium ulotheca, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming species that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a flattened, ribbon-like body called a thallus, which lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces through spores released from sporangia that are clustered in structures called soridia. Polypodium ulotheca plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
