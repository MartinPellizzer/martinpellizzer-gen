    "intro": "Phaeanthus nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered phaeanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its flowers are tubular and attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaeanthus nigrescens is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
