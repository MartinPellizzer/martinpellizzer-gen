    "intro": "Populus yunsiaomanshanensis, commonly known as the Yunsiao Manshan poplar, is a rare species of poplar native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and distinctive bark that becomes fissured with age. This plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring cool, moist environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, which is typical for the Populus genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
