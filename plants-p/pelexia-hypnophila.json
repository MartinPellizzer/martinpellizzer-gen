    "intro": "Pelexia hypnophila, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close during the day. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, dark purple berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Pelexia hypnophila is often found in wetlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for nocturnal pollinators."
