    "intro": "Polypodium polyodon, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The golden polypody is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
