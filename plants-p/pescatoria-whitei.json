    "intro": "Pescatoria whitei, commonly known as the white's pescatoria, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow ray florets and compact, daisy-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the late summer to early autumn months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pescatoria whitei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
