    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 mantoniae, commonly known as the hybrid wall fern, is a fern species that results from the cross between Polypodium aculeatum and Polypodium polystichum. It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a rough, textured surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown flap. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
