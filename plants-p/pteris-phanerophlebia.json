    "intro": "Pteris phanerophlebia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae, which are broad and often have a wavy margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
