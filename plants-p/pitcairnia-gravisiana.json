    "intro": "Pitcairnia gravisiana, commonly known as the royal pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, waxy, strap-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in a spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia gravisiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse collections."
