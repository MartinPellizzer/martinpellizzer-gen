    "intro": "Pilosella brachiata subsp. gracillima, commonly known as the slender leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and is often found in temperate climates. Its botanical characteristics make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native range."
