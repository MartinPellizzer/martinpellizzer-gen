    "intro": "Polypodium zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
