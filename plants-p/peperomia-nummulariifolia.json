    "intro": "Peperomia nummulariifolia, commonly known as the coinleaf peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, round, waxy leaves that resemble coins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 cm and has a dense, bushy appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia nummulariifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
