    "intro": "Pedilonum megaceras, commonly known as the giant horned orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, featuring a distinctive horn-like spur. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and is typically found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
