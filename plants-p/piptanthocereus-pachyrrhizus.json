    "intro": "Piptanthocereus pachyrrhizus, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding ornamental value. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and succulent stems that store water. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
