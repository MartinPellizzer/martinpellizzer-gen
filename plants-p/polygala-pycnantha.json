    "intro": "Polygala pycnantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
