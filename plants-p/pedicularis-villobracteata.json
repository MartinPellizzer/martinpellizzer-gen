It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure. Its leaves are often reduced or scale-like, and it produces small, fleshy fruits called capsules. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
