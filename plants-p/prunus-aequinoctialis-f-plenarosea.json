    "intro": "Prunus aequinoctialis f. plenarosea, commonly known as the Japanese cherry plum with double pink flowers, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its profuse display of double, pinkish-white blossoms that appear in early spring. The plant is a small to medium-sized deciduous shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The fruit is a small, yellowish plum that ripens in late summer, though it is primarily grown for ornamental purposes due to its showy flowers."
