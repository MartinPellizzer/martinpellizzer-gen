    "intro": "Persica tristis, commonly known as the bitter almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically bitter and contain toxic seeds. Persica tristis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fragrant blossoms. However, it requires careful handling due to the presence of cyanogenic compounds in its seeds and leaves."
