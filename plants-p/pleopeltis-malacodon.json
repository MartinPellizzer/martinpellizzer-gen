    "intro": "Pleopeltis malacodon, commonly known as the Malacodon fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
