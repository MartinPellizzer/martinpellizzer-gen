It features thick, waxy, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it suitable for both tabletop displays and as part of a collection of ornamental plants."
