    "intro": "Pouteria gardneri, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stem. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody pods containing the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are enclosed in a hard, fibrous shell and are rich in nutrients, particularly oils and proteins. Pouteria gardneri plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest, providing food for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
