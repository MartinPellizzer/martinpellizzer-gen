    "intro": "Phegopteris austroussuriensis, commonly known as the Southern Ussuri Fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Japan, and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions, where it can receive the necessary humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
