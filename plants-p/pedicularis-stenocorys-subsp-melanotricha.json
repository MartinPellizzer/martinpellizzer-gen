It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. This plant is part of the Orobanchaceae family and is known for its parasitic nature, drawing nutrients from its host plants."
