    "intro": "Prunus feriarum, commonly known as the \"Friday cherry,\" is a rare and ancient species of cherry native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, dark red fruits that ripen in late summer, typically around the time of the Japanese festival of Tanabata, which is associated with the stars Vega and Altair. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and white or pale pink flowers in spring. Its botanical significance lies in its historical and cultural importance, as well as its unique flowering and fruiting patterns. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Prunus feriarum is considered an endangered species."
