    "intro": "Padus pumicea, commonly known as the pumice maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive pumice-like bark, which is rough and fissured, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, red or orange flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges, and they turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. Padus pumicea is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodlands."
