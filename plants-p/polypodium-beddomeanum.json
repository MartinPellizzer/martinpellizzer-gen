    "intro": "Polypodium beddomeanum, commonly known as the Beddome's polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium beddomeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
