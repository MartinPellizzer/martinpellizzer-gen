    "intro": "Pteris natalensis, commonly known as Natal water fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris natalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
