    "intro": "Pterodiscus ruspolii, commonly known as the Ruspoli's pterodiscus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It is native to specific regions in Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterodiscus ruspolii is considered a species of conservation concern."
