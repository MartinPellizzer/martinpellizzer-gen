    "intro": "Plesioneuron altum, commonly known as the tall plesioneuron, is a rare and lesser-known fern species. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
