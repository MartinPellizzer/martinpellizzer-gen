    "intro": "Physalis lurida, commonly known as the prickly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny calyces that enclose the bright orange berries. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to red in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along rocky soils and in desert scrub habitats. The berries are edible when ripe but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities."
