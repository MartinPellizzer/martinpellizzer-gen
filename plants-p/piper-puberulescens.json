    "intro": "Piper puberulescens, commonly known as the hairy pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
