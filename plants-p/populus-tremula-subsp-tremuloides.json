    "intro": "Populus tremula subsp. tremuloides, commonly known as the quaking aspen, is a deciduous tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trembling leaves, which flutter in the wind due to the flattened petioles. This subspecies typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across North America. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it plays an important role in ecological succession and wildlife habitats."
