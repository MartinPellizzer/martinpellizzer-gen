    "intro": "Perobachne, commonly known as the grass genus, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in various habitats, including grasslands and wetlands, and are characterized by their slender, grass-like foliage. Perobachne species often have small, spikelet-based inflorescences and produce wind-pollinated flowers. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide forage for grazing animals. The genus is distributed across different regions, with some species adapted to specific environmental conditions."
