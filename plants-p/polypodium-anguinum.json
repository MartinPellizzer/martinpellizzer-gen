    "intro": "Polypodium anguinum, commonly known as the snake fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its wiry, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the air. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Polypodium anguinum is often found in shaded, moist forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
