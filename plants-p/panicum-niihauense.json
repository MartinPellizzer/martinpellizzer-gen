    "intro": "Panicum niihauense, commonly known as Niihau grass, is a perennial grass native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green or pale in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat. Due to its historical and cultural significance, it is also considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
