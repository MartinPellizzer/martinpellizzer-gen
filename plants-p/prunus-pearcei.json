    "intro": "Prunus pearcei, commonly known as the Mexican ash or ash-leaf maple, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in dry to moist forests. Prunus pearcei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
