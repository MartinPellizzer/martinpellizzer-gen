    "intro": "Polygala baetica var. stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to the dry, rocky environments where it thrives. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a unique structure that resembles a spurred shape, aiding in pollination by insects. This plant is often found in Mediterranean scrublands and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and ornamental value."
