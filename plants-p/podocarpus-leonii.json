    "intro": "Podocarpus leonii, commonly known as the Mexican incense cedar, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and aromatic, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often used in ornamental horticulture. The tree is also valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making."
