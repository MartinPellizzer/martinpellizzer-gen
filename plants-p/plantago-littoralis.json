    "intro": "Plantago littoralis, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
