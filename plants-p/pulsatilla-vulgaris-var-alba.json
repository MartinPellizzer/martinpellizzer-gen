    "intro": "Pulsatilla vulgaris var. alba, commonly known as the white pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem that supports its single flower, which is surrounded by a cluster of bracts. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are covered in a fine, white down. The white pasqueflower is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is known for its early blooming period, making it an important early-season nectar source for pollinators."
