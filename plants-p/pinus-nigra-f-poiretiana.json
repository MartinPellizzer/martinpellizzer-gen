    "intro": "Pinus nigra f. poiretiana, commonly known as the Poiret's black pine, is a subspecies of the black pine native to the southern Alps and parts of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The cones of this plant are relatively small, measuring up to 5 centimeters, and they mature within one year. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
