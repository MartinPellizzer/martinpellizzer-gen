    "intro": "Pavonia fryxelliana, commonly known as the Fryxell's false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, pink to red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Pavonia fryxelliana is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
