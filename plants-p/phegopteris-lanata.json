    "intro": "Phegopteris lanata, commonly known as the downy holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
