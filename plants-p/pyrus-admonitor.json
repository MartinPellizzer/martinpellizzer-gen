    "intro": "Pyrus admonitor, commonly known as the warning pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. Its fruits are small pomes, typically green when mature, and are not widely cultivated for human consumption. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential for hybridization with other pear species."
