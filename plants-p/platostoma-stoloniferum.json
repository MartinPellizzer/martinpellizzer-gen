    "intro": "Platostoma stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping rockrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense colonies. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid and rocky environments. Platostoma stoloniferum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
