    "intro": "Pellaea cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pellaea cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
