    "intro": "Potentilla pimpinelloides subsp. visianii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are densely hairy, providing it with a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
