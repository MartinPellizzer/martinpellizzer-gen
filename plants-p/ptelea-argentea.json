    "intro": "Ptelea argentea, commonly known as silverleaf ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides of leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Ptelea argentea is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
