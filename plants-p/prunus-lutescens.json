    "intro": "Prunus lutescens, commonly known as the yellow cherry or yellow almond, is a species of flowering shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round fruits that turn from red to dark purple as they mature. Prunus lutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms and compact growth habit. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile choice for temperate climates."
