    "intro": "Pollinia nuda var. capensis, commonly known as the Cape pollen orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pollinia that are loosely attached to the flower, a feature that sets it apart from many other orchid species. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters. Its botanical structure includes a short, fleshy stem and narrow, linear leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, coastal areas."
