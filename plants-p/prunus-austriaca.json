    "intro": "Prunus austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible cherries that are typically red when mature, though they are not as commonly consumed as other cherry varieties. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus austriaca is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its spring blossoms and attractive foliage."
