    "intro": "Pilostyles collina, commonly known as the mountain ghostplant, is a rare and unusual flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, thread-like flowers that are often pale green or white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, and it is considered a specialist species with a very limited geographic range. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pilostyles collina is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
