    "intro": "Phalaris rubens, commonly known as red beakgrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of small, red-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive reddish hue along the edges. Phalaris rubens is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
