    "intro": "Polygonum acre var. confertiflorum, commonly known as swamp knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features rhizomatous growth and heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pinkish to white flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, making it a common species in marshes and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
