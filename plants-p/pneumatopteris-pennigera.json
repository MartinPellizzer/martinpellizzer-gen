    "intro": "Pneumatopteris pennigera, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length, with a distinctive, lobed structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are covered in tiny pores that aid in gas exchange, making it well adapted to its aquatic lifestyle."
