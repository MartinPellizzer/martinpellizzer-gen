    "intro": "Panicum italicum var. brevisetum, commonly known as dwarf Italian grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds. This plant is often used in ornamental landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It prefers full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
