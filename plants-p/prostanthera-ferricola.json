It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. The leaves are narrow and have a fragrant, mint-like scent when crushed."
