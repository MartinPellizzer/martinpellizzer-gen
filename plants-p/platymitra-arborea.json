    "intro": "Platymitra arborea, commonly known as the tree platymitra, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive leaf morphology, with elliptical leaves that are often adorned with fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Platymitra arborea is considered an endangered species with significant ecological value."
