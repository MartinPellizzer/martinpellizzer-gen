    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 rhaetica nothovar. bolosii, commonly known as the Bolosii pine, is a hybrid conifer native to the western United States. It is a cross between Pinus muricata and Pinus aristata, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as the Sierra Nevada and the Great Basin. It features needle-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces cones that are elongated and often persist on the tree for several years. This nothovar is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
