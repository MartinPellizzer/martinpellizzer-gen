    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. subifoliatum, commonly known as the creeping or trailing pea, is a botanical variant of the common pea plant. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often lie along the ground rather than growing upright. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and the flowers are typically purple or white, similar to other pea species. This variety is cultivated for its edible pods and seeds, which are used in various culinary applications. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in plant morphology and agricultural botany."
