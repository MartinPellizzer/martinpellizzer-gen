    "intro": "Prunus verecunda, commonly known as the alpine cherry or dwarf cherry, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, sweet-tart berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Prunus verecunda thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
