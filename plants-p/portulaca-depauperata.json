    "intro": "Portulaca depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's purslane, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in hot, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has a shallow root system and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly tangy flavor, often used in salads or as a garnish."
