It is characterized by its large size, white plumage, and distinctive yellow and grey facial markings. The bird's diet primarily consists of seeds, fruits, and nuts, which it cracks open with its strong beak. It plays an important ecological role in seed dispersal within its habitat. The species is also known for its loud, raucous calls that can be heard over long distances."
