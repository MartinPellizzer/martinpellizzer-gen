It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that exhibit a fibrous texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with pinnae that are narrow and elongated. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to woodland gardens."
