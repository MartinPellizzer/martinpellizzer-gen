    "intro": "Panicum helleri, commonly known as Heller's panicgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast region. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in full sun. Panicum helleri is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
