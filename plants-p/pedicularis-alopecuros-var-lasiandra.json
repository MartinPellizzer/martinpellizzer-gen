    "intro": "Pedicularis alopecuros var. lasiandra, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its tubular, often brightly colored flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing on its own. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
