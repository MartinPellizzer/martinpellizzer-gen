    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Polygala vulgaris."
