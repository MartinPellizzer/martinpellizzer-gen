    "intro": "Phyllanthus collinsiae var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-seeded phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
