It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by oval, woody capsules containing seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water retention. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded lands."
