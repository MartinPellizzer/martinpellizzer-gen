    "intro": "Presla limosa, commonly known as the marsh saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. Presla limosa is often found in regions with temperate climates and is adapted to fluctuating water levels."
