    "intro": "Pilocereus albisetosus, commonly known as the white-bristled night bloomer, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered with white, bristly spines and produces large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic landscapes. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only during the evening and closing by dawn. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
