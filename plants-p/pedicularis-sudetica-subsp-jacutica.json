    "intro": "Pedicularis sudetica subsp. jacutica, commonly known as the Jacutian lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants while performing photosynthesis. The flowers typically range in color from pink to red, with a distinctive hooded structure that resembles a louse, hence its common name. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including the Caucasus and the Altai Mountains. This species thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest edges and rocky slopes."
