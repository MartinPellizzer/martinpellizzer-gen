    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. pectinata, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments such as slopes and gravelly areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
