    "intro": "Pomax umbellata, commonly known as the broad-leafed umbrella plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
