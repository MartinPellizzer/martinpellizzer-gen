    "intro": "Pronephrium clemensiae, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are slender and often root in the substrate, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually submerged, with only the tips occasionally emerging above the water surface."
