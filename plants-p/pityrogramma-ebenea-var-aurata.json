    "intro": "Pityrogramma ebenea var. aurata, commonly known as the golden water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pityrogramma. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green veins, making it visually distinctive. This fern is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Its unique coloration and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental use in aquatic and semi-aquatic gardens."
