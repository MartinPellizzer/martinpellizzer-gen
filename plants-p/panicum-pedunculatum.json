    "intro": "Panicum pedunculatum, commonly known as purpletop grass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its striking purple-tinted inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more intense in the fall. Panicum pedunculatum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
