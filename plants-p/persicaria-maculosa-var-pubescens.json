    "intro": "Persicaria maculosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy smartweed, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish or purplish tinge along the veins. Small clusters of pink to reddish flowers appear at the tips of the stems, typically in late summer. This plant thrives in moist soil and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks."
