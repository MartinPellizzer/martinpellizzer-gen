    "intro": "Pitcairnia amaryllidiflora, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in a spike, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
