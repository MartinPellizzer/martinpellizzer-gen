    "intro": "Pellaea geraniifolia, commonly known as the fern moss or rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It features delicate, leathery leaves that are divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices or on shaded, moist soil, thriving in humid environments. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping it to anchor itself in challenging substrates. Pellaea geraniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
