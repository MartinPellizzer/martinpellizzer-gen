    "intro": "Pleienta fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered pleienta, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native habitat."
