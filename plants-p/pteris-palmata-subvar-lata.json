    "intro": "Pteris palmata subvar. lata, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
