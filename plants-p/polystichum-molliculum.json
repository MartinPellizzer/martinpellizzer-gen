    "intro": "Polystichum molliculum, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy fronds that give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a complex, lacy structure. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns."
