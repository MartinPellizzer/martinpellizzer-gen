    "intro": "Pharium herbertii, commonly known as Herbert's pharium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows from a bulbous rootstock and produces strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in drought conditions. Pharium herbertii is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
