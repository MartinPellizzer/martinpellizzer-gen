    "intro": "Phyllomphax helleborina, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, holly-like foliage with bright green, lance-shaped leaves that remain upright throughout the winter. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest floors and rocky habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phyllomphax helleborina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
