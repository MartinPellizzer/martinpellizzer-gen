    "intro": "Panicum acrotrichum, commonly known as hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Panicum acrotrichum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged environments."
