It produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is typically found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
