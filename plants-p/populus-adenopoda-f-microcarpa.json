    "intro": "Populus adenopoda f. microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poplar, is a distinct form of the poplar genus characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves. It is native to parts of China and is typically found in moist, temperate forest environments. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, with bark that becomes fissured and flaky as it matures. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it relies on wind pollination. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
