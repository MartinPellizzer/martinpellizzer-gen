    "intro": "Phyteuma pedemontanum, commonly known as the Alpine phyteuma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of pale blue to violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires full sun and good drainage to flourish."
