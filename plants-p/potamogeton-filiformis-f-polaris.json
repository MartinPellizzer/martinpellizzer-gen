    "intro": "Potamogeton filiformis f. polaris, commonly known as the polar threadstem pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in diameter. The plant thrives in cold, oligotrophic waters and is often found in lakes and rivers with low nutrient levels. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually borne in clusters near the water surface. This variety is adapted to the extreme environmental conditions of its habitat, including low temperatures and limited light penetration."
