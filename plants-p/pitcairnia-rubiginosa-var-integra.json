    "intro": "Pitcairnia rubiginosa var. integra, commonly known as the red pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround a central spadix, creating a visually dramatic display. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are stiff and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps retain moisture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
