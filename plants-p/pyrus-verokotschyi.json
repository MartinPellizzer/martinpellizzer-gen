    "intro": "Pyrus verokotschyi, commonly known as the Verokotschi pear, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Pyrus genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The plant is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically not cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in cold, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
