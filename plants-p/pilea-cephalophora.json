    "intro": "Pilea cephalophora, commonly known as the shining arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea cephalophora is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
