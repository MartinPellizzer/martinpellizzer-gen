    "intro": "Pulicaria paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox annual, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flower heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pulicaria paradoxa is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained environments."
