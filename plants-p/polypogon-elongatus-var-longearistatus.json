    "intro": "Polypogon elongatus var. longearistatus, commonly known as the long-awned barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, pubescent awns that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and ligulate, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This grass is considered a weed in many areas due to its competitive growth habit and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
