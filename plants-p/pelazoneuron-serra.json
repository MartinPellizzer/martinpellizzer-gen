    "intro": "Pelazoneuron serra, commonly known as the serrated leaf fern, is a unique plant with distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, supporting the growth of its delicate, feathery fronds. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
