    "intro": "Poa effusa, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Botanically, Poa effusa is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
