    "intro": "Pseudopaegma insculptum, commonly known as the sculpted rock cress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and distinctive, intricately patterned leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle beauty to its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental needs, Pseudopaegma insculptum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
