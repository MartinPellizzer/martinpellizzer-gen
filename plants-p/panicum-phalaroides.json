    "intro": "Panicum phalaroides, commonly known as yellow foxtail, is a warm-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets that form the distinctive foxtail-like inflorescence, which is typically golden-yellow in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a troublesome weed in agricultural settings."
