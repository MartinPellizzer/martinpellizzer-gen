    "intro": "Piper nigrum var. hirtellosum, commonly known as the hairy black pepper plant, is a variant of the black pepper species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more common smooth-leafed varieties. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a dark red or black color, similar to standard black pepper. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is primarily cultivated for its peppercorns, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
