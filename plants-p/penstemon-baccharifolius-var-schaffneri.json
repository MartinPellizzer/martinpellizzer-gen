It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique floral structure and adaptability to arid environments make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
