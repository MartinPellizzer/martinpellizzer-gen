    "intro": "Pinus montana proles uncinata, commonly known as the Alpine fir or mountain fir, is a rare and specialized conifer native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of other pine species. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients. Its cones are small and often remain closed for extended periods, a feature that aids in seed dispersal in its challenging habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
