    "intro": "Pseudopanax, commonly known as the New Zealand clubmoss, is a genus of evergreen shrubs native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that are often mistaken for ferns. The plants have a distinctive, gnarled appearance with a thick, woody trunk and a crown of narrow, needle-like foliage. Pseudopanax species are typically found in cool, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. They play an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems."
