    "intro": "Parrya nudicaulis var. rydbergii, commonly known as the Rydberg's nakedstem parrya, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
