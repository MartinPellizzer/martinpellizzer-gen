    "intro": "Poa bactriana, commonly known as the Afghan meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, Poa bactriana is an important component of grassland ecosystems in its native range."
