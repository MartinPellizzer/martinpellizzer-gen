    "intro": "Potentilla ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems and hairy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Potentilla ehrenbergiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
