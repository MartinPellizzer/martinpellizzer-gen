    "intro": "Pyrus scopulina, commonly known as the rock pear, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Pyrus scopulina is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
