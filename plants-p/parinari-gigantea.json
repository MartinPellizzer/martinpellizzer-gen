It is characterized by its large, simple leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing a rugged appearance. The species is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
