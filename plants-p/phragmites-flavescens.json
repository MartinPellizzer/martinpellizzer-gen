    "intro": "Phragmites flavescens, commonly known as the yellow reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense growth and hollow, cylindrical stems that often form extensive stands. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across wetland habitats. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a distinctive yellowish-green color, which gives it its common name. Phragmites flavescens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
