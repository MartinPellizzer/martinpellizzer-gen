    "intro": "Pfosseria bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Turkey. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Pfosseria bithynica plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
