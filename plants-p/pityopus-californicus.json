It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal and inland areas. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight hairy texture. Pityopus californicus is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
