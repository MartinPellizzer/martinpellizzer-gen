    "intro": "Potentilla mixta, commonly known as the mixed potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Potentilla mixta is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
