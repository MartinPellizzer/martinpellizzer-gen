It features silver-white, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and its flowers are typically pale yellow to cream, appearing in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
