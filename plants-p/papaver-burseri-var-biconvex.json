    "intro": "Papaver burseri var. biconvex, commonly known as the biconvex poppy, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed, convex-shaped petals that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The biconvex poppy is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
