    "intro": "Plantago plicata, commonly known as the narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
