    "intro": "Pinus pinaster var. prolifera, commonly known as the maritime pine, is a variant of the Spanish pine native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical variety. The tree produces cones that are elongated and often have a reddish-brown color, containing edible seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
