    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. pygmaeum, commonly known as little barley, is a small annual grass that thrives in disturbed soils and moist environments. It has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. It is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
