It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its leaves and stems contain mucilage, which has been used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
