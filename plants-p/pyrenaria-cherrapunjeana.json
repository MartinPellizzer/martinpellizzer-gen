    "intro": "Pyrenaria cherrapunjeana, commonly known as the Cherrapunji orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the northeastern region of India. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the dense forests of the Western Ghats and the northeastern hills. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful protection."
