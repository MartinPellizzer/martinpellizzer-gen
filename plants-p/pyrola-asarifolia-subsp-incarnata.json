    "intro": "Pyrola asarifolia subsp. incarnata, commonly known as the redstem wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, contributing to its dense, compact appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in early spring. Its subspecies distinction is primarily based on the color and structure of its stems and leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
