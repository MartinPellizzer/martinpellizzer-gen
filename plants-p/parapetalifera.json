It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, typically greenish or reddish in color. Parapetalifera species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are noted for their medicinal properties, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful handling."
