    "intro": "Polygala berlandieri var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in montane grasslands and scrub habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
