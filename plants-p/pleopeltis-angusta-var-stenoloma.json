    "intro": "Pleopeltis angusta var. stenoloma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Pleopeltis angusta."
