It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures.
