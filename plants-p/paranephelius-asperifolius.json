    "intro": "Paranephelius asperifolius, commonly known as the rough-leaved paranehelium, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, providing a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
