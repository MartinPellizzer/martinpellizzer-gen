    "intro": "Phegopteris schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are divided into small, needle-like segments. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. This fern plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
