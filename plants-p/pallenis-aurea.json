    "intro": "Pallenis aurea, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Pallenis aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
