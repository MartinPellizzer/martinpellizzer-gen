    "intro": "Poa glauca subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and alpine meadows, where it forms dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences are adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Poa glauca subsp. rupicola plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
