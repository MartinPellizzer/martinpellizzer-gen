    "intro": "Pandanus dhaenii, commonly known as the Hainan screw pine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which are long, narrow, and often covered in a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically at the ends of the leafy stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize the plant in coastal or swampy environments. Pandanus dhaenii is often used in traditional crafts and has ecological significance in its native habitats."
