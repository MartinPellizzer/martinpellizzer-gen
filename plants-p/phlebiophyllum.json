    "intro": "Phlebiophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves and its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phlebiophyllum is considered a conservation concern."
