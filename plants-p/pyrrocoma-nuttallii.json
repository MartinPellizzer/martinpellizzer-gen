    "intro": "Pyrrocoma nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's pygmy grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
