    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subsp. dunensis, commonly known as the Duneland milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to harsh environments."
