    "intro": "Plantago affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and gardens. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties."
