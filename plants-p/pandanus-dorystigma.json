    "intro": "Pandanus dorystigma, commonly known as the dwarf screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its fibrous, strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional weaving practices. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize coastal soils. Pandanus dorystigma is well adapted to salty, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove areas."
