    "intro": "Phoebe mollicella, commonly known as the silky phoebe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive silvery-blue hue on the undersides of its leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded gardens. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscape design in humid climates."
