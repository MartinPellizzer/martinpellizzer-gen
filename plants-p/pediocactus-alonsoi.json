It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
