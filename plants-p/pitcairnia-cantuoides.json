    "intro": "Pitcairnia cantuoides, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, velvety foliage that forms a rosette shape. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Pitcairnia cantuoides thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
