It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
