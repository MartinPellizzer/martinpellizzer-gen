    "intro": "Phylica abietina, commonly known as the silver tree, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect light. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter, followed by distinctive cone-like fruits. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, contributing to its drought tolerance. Phylica abietina is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
