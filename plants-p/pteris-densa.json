    "intro": "Pteris densa, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds that give it a shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, hairy layer, which helps retain moisture. Pteris densa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
