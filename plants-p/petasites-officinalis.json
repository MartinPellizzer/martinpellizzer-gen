    "intro": "Petasites officinalis, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
