    "intro": "Polypodium connatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices. Polypodium connatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
