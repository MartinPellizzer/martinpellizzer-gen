It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. The plant has a well-developed rhizome system that allows it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Plesioneuron phanerophlebium thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in dense forests where high humidity and rich soil support its growth."
