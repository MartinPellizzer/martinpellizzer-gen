    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 correllii, commonly known as the Correll's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as swamps and pine flatwoods. Its flowers are pollinated by flies and beetles, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
