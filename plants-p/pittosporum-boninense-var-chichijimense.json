It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically orange or red in color. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in coastal or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
