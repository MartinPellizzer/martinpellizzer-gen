    "intro": "Potentilla varia var. filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
