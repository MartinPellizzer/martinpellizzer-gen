    "intro": "Poljakanthema kokanica, commonly known as the Kokanica poljakanthema, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Europe. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
