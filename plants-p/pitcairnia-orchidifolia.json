    "intro": "Pitcairnia orchidifolia, commonly known as the orchid leaf pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup. The plant produces clusters of showy, orchid-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Pitcairnia orchidifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
