It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that are often concealed within the dense foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
