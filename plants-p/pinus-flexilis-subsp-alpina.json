    "intro": "Pinus flexilis subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine flexibletree, is a subspecies of the flexibletree native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen with slender, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to cold, dry environments and often grows in rocky or well-drained soils. Its growth habit is generally low and spreading, forming dense, wind-resistant stands in alpine ecosystems."
