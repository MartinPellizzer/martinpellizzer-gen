    "intro": "Pronephrium granulosum, commonly known as the granular pronephrium, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its submerged, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by water currents rather than insects. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sediment in aquatic environments. Pronephrium granulosum is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
