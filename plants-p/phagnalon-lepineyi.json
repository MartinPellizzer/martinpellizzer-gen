It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phagnalon lepineyi is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
