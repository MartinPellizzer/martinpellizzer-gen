    "intro": "Polylepis serrata var. parcipila, commonly known as the Andean waxtree, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage and serrated leaf margins, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
