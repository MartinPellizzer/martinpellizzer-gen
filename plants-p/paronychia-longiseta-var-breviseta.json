    "intro": "Paronychia longiseta var. breviseta, commonly known as the short-hairy sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically short and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its shorter, more densely hairy leaves."
