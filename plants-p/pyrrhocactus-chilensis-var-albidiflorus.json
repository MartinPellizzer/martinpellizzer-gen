    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus chilensis var. albidiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered Chilean cactus, is a succulent native to Chile. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to dry climates."
