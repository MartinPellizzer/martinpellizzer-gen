    "intro": "Paspalum borbonicum, commonly known as the Brazilian paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Paspalum borbonicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
