    "intro": "Philodendron victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria's Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that can grow quite large, often reaching up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the forest floor or climb toward the canopy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil."
