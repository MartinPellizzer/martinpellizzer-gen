    "intro": "Phacelia leonis, commonly known as blue phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Phacelia leonis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
