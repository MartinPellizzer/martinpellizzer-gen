    "intro": "Populus oliuboi, commonly known as the black poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Populus oliuboi is valued for its fast growth and historical use in timber and paper production."
