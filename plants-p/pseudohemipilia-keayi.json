    "intro": "Pseudohemipilia keayi, commonly known as the Keay's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and elongated, strap-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique structure that resembles the ghostly appearance for which it is named. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pseudohemipilia keayi is considered critically endangered."
