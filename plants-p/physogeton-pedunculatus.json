It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping prey. This carnivorous plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-white, with distinctive spurred petals. The plant is well adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
