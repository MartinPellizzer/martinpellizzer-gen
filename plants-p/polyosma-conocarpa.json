    "intro": "Polyosma conocarpa, commonly known as the Andean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and yellowish-white flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as oaks and maples, through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Polyosma conocarpa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
