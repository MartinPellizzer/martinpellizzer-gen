    "intro": "Pedilonum molle, commonly known as the soft-footed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hanging flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Pedilonum molle thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
