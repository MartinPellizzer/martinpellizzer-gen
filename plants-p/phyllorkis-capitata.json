It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The flowers are usually pale green to yellow and are pollinated by insects."
