    "intro": "Pedicularis thailandica subsp. parvula, commonly known as the Thai monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Thailand. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and blooms during the spring and early summer. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
