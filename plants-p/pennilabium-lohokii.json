    "intro": "Pennilabium lohokii, commonly known as the Lohokii orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a striking array of colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pennilabium lohokii is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
