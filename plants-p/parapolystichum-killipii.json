    "intro": "Parapolystichum killipii, commonly known as the Killip's water fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the wetlands of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, acidic soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
