    "intro": "Parosela johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's parosela, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces delicate, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of this unique species."
