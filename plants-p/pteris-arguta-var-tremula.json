    "intro": "Pteris arguta var. tremula, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, tremulous movement due to its finely serrated leaflets. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
