It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
