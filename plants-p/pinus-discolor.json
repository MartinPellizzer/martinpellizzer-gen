    "intro": "Pinus discolor, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive white to gray bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its serotinous cones that open only after exposure to heat, typically from a forest fire. The tree produces edible seeds called pine nuts, which are encased in its woody cones. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ecological importance and vulnerability to diseases like white pine blister rust, it is a significant species in forest ecosystems."
