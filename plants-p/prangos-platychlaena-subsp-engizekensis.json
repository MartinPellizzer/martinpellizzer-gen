    "intro": "Prangos platychlaena subsp. engizekensis, commonly known as the Engizekensis goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
