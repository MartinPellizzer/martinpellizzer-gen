    "intro": "Platanthera chlorantha subsp. holmboei, commonly known as the Holmboe's yellow twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to moist, calcareous habitats such as mossy woodlands and stream banks. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas."
