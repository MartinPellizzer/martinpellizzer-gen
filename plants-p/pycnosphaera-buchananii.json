    "intro": "Pycnosphaera buchananii, commonly known as the African white stinkwood, is a member of the Rhamnaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, with a thick, flaky bark that exudes a strong, unpleasant odor when cut. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. This species is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and it also plays a role in local ecosystems as a habitat and food source."
