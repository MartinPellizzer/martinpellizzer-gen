It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
