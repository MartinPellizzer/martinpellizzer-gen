    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis dependens, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a sympodial growth habit. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air. The genus Pleurothallis is one of the largest in the orchid family, with over 1,500 species, many of which are epiphytic."
