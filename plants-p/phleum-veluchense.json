    "intro": "Phleum veluchense, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which makes it well-suited for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance. Phleum veluchense is also valued for its ability to withstand moderate foot traffic, making it a popular choice for lawns and sports fields."
