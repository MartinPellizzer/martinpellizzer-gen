    "intro": "Pterostylis rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant features a slender, often reddish stem and produces small, greenish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spike. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
