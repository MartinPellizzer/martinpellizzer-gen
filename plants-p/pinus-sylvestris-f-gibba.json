    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. gibba, commonly known as the knob pine, is a botanical variant of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, or knob-like growths on the branches, which give it its unique appearance. This form is typically found in specific ecological conditions, often in areas with limited sunlight or nutrient-poor soils. The plant retains its needle-like leaves for several years, contributing to its evergreen nature. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its environment, making it a notable subject in botanical studies."
