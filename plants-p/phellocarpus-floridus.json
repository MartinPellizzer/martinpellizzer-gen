    "intro": "Phellocarpus floridus, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetland areas and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a glossy surface. The botanical features of Phellocarpus floridus make it well adapted to moist, acidic soils and a variety of wetland habitats."
