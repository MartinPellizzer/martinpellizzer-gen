    "intro": "Phlox fruticosa, commonly known as summer phlox, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems covered in dense clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and produces small, dark blue or black berries in the fall. Its foliage is lance-shaped and provides a nice contrast to the vibrant floral display. Phlox fruticosa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for garden landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
