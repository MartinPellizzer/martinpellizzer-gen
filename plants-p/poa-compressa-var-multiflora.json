    "intro": "Poa compressa var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, mat-forming growth with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its fine texture and adaptability, it is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes for its aesthetic and functional qualities."
