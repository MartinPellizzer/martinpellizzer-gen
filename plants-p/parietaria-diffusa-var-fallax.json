    "intro": "Parietaria diffusa var. fallax, commonly known as the common wall-rocket, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on walls, in crevices, or in damp woodlands. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine, though they can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
