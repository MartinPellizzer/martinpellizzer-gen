It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in the habitat. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
