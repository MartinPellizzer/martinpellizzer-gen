    "intro": "Pternandra angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pternandra, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
