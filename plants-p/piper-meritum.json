    "intro": "Piper meritum, commonly known as black pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Malabar Coast of India. It belongs to the family Piperaceae and is characterized by its small, dark red berries that are harvested and dried to produce the familiar spice. The plant is a perennial vine that thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and warm temperatures. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its stems are woody and often climb using aerial roots. The fruit, known as a drupe, contains a single seed and is the primary source of the spice used in cooking and traditional medicine."
