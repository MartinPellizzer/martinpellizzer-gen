    "intro": "Pyrus chamaemespilus subvar. crantzii, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, edible berries that are often consumed by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subshrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
