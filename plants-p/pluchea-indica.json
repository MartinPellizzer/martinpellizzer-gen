It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Pluchea indica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
