    "intro": "Ptilotus helipteroides var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spinifex, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features wiry, branching stems covered in small, spiky leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and limited water availability. This species is often used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
