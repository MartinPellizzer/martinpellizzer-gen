    "intro": "Pycnandra confusa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, orange-red fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture, and for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to overexploitation, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
