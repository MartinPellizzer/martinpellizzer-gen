    "intro": "Polypodium camptophyllarium var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-leaf cliff fern, is a variant of the cliff fern species native to certain regions of the eastern United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and shaded woodland floors, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves."
