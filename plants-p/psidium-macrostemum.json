    "intro": "Psidium macrostemum, commonly known as the large-stemmed guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into edible berries, similar to those of the common guava. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is valued for its aromatic flavor and nutritional content, though it is less commonly cultivated than other guava varieties."
