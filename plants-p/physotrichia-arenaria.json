    "intro": "Physotrichia arenaria, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and open habitats. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, fleshy, greenish fruits. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Physotrichia arenaria is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and resilience."
