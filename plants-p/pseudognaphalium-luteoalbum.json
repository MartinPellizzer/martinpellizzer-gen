    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium luteoalbum, commonly known as yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces fluffy, white to grayish seed heads that resemble miniature clouds, aiding in wind pollination. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pseudognaphalium luteoalbum is often used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting, fluffy appearance."
