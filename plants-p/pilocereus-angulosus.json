    "intro": "Pilocereus angulosus, commonly known as the angular night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, angular stems that are typically green and covered with small, white spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardeners."
