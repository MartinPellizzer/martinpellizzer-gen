    "intro": "Polystichum longipaleatum, commonly known as the long-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with long, slender pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
