    "intro": "Phoradendron parietarioides, commonly known as the parietary dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Santalaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
