It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It contains various toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and is more commonly found in wild, undisturbed areas."
