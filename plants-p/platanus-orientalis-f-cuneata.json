    "intro": "Platanus orientalis f. cuneata, commonly known as the Oriental Plane with cuneate leaves, is a variant of the Oriental Plane tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, cuneate (wedge-shaped) leaves that are often broader at the base. The tree produces large, spherical, brownish fruits that contain three to five seeds. It is native to parts of southern Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This form is typically found in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit."
