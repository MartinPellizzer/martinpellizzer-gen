    "intro": "Pyrus cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in late summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant. Pyrus cordata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
