    "intro": "Ptychosperma cuneatum, commonly known as the broadleaf sago, is a cycad native to Madagascar. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are dark green, with a waxy texture, and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is dioecious, meaning male and female plants are separate. The plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
