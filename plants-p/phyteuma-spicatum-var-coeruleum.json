    "intro": "Phyteuma spicatum var. coeruleum, commonly known as the blue-flowered phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators."
