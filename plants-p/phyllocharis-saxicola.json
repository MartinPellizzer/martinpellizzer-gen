    "intro": "Phyllocharis saxicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments. It forms a thin, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. This species is characterized by its ability to grow on exposed rock surfaces, where it can absorb moisture from the air. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
