It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Pyrus ursina is often found in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
