It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring shorter and more densely packed needles compared to the typical variety. The cones of this form are usually smaller and more compact, contributing to its distinct appearance. It is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains. This form is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological characteristics."
