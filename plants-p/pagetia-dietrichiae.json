    "intro": "Pagetia dietrichiae, commonly known as the dwarf pagetia, is a small, mat-forming fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical and subtropical woodlands. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread across the forest floor. The species is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
