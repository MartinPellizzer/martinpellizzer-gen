    "intro": "Pinus rigida var. serotina, commonly known as the Appalachian white pine, is a variant of the eastern white pine native to the southeastern United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree produces cones that remain closed for several years before opening to release seeds, a trait known as serotiny. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and harsh environmental conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
