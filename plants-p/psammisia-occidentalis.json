    "intro": "Psammisia occidentalis, commonly known as the western sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It has adapted to arid conditions through its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Psammisia occidentalis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for various pollinators."
