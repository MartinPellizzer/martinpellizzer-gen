    "intro": "Phoebe galeottiana, commonly known as the Florida beech, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
