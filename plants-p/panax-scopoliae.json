    "intro": "Panax scopoliae, commonly known as the Scopolia ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Asia and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Its root system is similar to other ginseng species, with a fleshy, irregularly shaped root that is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
