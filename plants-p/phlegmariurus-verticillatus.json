    "intro": "Phlegmariurus verticillatus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the family Lepidoziaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is dominant in its life cycle. Its structure resembles that of true mosses, though it is more closely related to ferns. Phlegmariurus verticillatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
