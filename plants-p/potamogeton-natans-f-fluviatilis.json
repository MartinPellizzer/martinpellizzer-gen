It has long, flexible stems that are often branched and bear small, oval leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences near the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.
