    "intro": "Pedicularis elisabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
