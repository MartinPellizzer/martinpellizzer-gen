    "intro": "Podochilus lucescens, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Podochilus lucescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
