    "intro": "Petasites frigidus subsp. sibiricus, commonly known as the Siberian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by spiky, poisonous berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
