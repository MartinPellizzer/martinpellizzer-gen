    "intro": "Pityrogramma chrysophylla var. divulgata, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the genus Pityrogramma, which belongs to the family Blechnaceae. This fern is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
