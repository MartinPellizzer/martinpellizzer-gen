It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and vibrant purple to silver plumes that appear in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself contribute to its widespread use in landscaping. Pennisetum annuum is also valued for its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
