    "intro": "Pogostemon pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf pogostemon, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in spikes at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
