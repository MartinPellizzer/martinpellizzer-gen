It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers that attract pollinators. Psychotria brachylaena is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses in traditional medicine."
