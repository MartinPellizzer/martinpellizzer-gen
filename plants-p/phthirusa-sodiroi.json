    "intro": "Phthirusa sodiroi, commonly known as the Sodiro's phthirusa, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity in the Andean region."
