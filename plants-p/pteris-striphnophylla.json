    "intro": "Pteris striphnophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces numerous erect, spore-bearing fiddleheads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its fronds are covered in fine, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory."
