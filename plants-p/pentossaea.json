    "intro": "Pentossaea, commonly known as the silver fir, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of Pentossaea are usually pendulous and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its wood is valued for its strength and durability, though it is not as widely used commercially as other conifers."
