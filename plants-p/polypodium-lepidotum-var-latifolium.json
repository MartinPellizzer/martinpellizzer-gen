    "intro": "Polypodium lepidotum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
