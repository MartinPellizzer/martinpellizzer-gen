It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, edible pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Botanically, it has compound leaves with stipules and a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation. It is an important plant for both ecological and agricultural studies due to its adaptability and nutritional value."
