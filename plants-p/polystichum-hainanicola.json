    "intro": "Polystichum hainanicola, commonly known as the Hainan cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in humid, temperate climates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Polystichum hainanicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
