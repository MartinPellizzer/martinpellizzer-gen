    "intro": "Pouteria tridentata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces woody capsules that contain the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, and essential minerals. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its habitat and is also economically important for its nut production."
