    "intro": "Pterocarpus wallichii, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, which is a common feature in many leguminous plants. The tree is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
