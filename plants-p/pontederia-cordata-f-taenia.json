    "intro": "Pontederia cordata f. taenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a variant of the water hyacinth characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves. It is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in dense spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters while absorbing nutrients from the water. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in water purification."
