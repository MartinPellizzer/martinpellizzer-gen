    "intro": "Pernettya ovata, commonly known as the oval cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces delicate white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, red, fleshy berries that are edible. Pernettya ovata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
