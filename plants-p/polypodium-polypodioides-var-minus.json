It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, lance-shaped fronds. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves. The varietal form 'minus' is distinguished by its smaller leaf size compared to the typical variety."
