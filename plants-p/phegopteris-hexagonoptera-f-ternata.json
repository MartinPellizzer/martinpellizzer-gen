    "intro": "Phegopteris hexagonoptera f. ternata, commonly known as the ternate maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
