    "intro": "Paliurus vulgaris, commonly known as the common paliurus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by small, red or orange fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Paliurus vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
