    "intro": "Planetangis, commonly known as the moonflower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its pale blooms. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a trailing or climbing structure depending on the species. Planetangis thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
