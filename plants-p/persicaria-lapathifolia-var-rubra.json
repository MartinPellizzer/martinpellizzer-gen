It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other species like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats."
