    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. major, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible but tart fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. The species is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
