    "intro": "Pelargonium hospitans, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It is a low-growing shrub that prefers well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
