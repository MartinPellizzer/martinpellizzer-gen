    "intro": "Polygala sibirica f. ciliata, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are alternate, narrow, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor, sandy soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique floral structure."
