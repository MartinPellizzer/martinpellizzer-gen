    "intro": "Panax manguette, commonly known as the Mexican ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, opposite, and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries containing seeds. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Mexican herbal medicine. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other ginseng species due to its specific habitat requirements."
