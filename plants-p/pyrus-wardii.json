    "intro": "Pyrus wardii, commonly known as the Ward's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas, primarily found in regions of Nepal and northern India. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, edible fruits that are similar to common pears. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus wardii is considered a rare and less studied species within the genus Pyrus."
