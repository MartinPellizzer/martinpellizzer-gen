    "intro": "Palmeria scandens var. typica, commonly known as the rock melon or desert melon, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a trailing or climbing annual herb with pale green, fleshy stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces edible, round, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
