    "intro": "Paspalum saltense, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and salt-tolerant properties, making it well adapted to saline environments. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal plains. Paspalum saltense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
