    "intro": "Paepalanthus percrassus, commonly known as the thick-leaved pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical or globose shape. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to access underground water. This cactus is adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
