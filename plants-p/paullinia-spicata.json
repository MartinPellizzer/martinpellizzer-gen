    "intro": "Paullinia spicata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody, spiny fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
