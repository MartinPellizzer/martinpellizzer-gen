    "intro": "Prunus fordiana, commonly known as the Chinese bird cherry, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, cherry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Prunus fordiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
