    "intro": "Prunus ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by edible drupes that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Prunus ovalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
