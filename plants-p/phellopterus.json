    "intro": "Phellopterus, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are typically found in alpine and arctic regions, thriving in cold, rocky environments. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and clusters of yellow or orange flowers. The leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Phellopterus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
