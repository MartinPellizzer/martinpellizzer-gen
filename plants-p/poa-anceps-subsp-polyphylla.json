    "intro": "Poa anceps subsp. polyphylla, commonly known as the mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous and alpine regions. It produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in high-elevation ecosystems."
