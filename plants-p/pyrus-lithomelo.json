    "intro": "Pyrus lithomelo, commonly known as the stone apple or lithomelo pear, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pyrus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with simple, alternate leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a small, round apple-like berry that ripens to a yellowish-green color and is edible, though not as widely cultivated as other pear species."
