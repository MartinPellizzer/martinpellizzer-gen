    "intro": "Polytoca sclerachne, commonly known as the hardstem grass, is a perennial grass species native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
