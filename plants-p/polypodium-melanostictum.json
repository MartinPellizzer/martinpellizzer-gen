    "intro": "Polypodium melanostictum, commonly known as the black-stained fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant's dark pigmentation and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
