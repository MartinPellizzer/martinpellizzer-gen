    "intro": "Phyla nodiflora var. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf silver carpet, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy species for coastal environments. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
