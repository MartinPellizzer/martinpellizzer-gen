    "intro": "Pellaea suksdorfiana, commonly known as the Suksdorf's spleenworts, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and intricate, lace-like fronds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pellaea suksdorfiana is considered a vulnerable species."
