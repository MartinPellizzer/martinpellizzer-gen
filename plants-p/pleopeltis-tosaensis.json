It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, often clustered growth habit. The plant features small, lanceolate leaves with a leathery texture and a distinctive, serrated margin. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically on rocky surfaces or tree trunks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
