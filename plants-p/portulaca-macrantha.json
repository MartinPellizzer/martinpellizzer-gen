    "intro": "Portulaca macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing, succulent plant with fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom during the day and close at night. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender pedicels, and the plant is well adapted to hot, dry environments. Portulaca macrantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
