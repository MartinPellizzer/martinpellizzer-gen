    "intro": "Pulsatilla turczaninovii, commonly known as the Turczaninov's pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellowish to orange-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, upright flowering stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
