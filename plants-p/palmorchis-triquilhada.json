    "intro": "Palmorchis triquilhada, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed structure in its flower petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within dense forests, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
