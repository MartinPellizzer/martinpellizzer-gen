It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and the stems are often hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
