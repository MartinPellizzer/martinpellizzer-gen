    "intro": "Piper subscutatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf pepper, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces tiny, three-lobed berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe. The plant is often found in humid, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
