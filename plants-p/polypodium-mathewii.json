    "intro": "Polypodium mathewii, commonly known as the Mathew's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, evergreen fronds that grow in a dense, upright manner. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are essential for reproduction. The foliage is often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties."
