    "intro": "Psittacanthus valleculanthus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble small stars. The plant features bright green, leathery leaves with a serrated margin, and it produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
