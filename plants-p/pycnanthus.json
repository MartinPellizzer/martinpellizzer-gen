    "intro": "Pycnanthus, commonly known as the African snowball, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plants are characterized by their dense clusters of small, white or pale flowers that resemble snowballs, hence their common name. They typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits. Pycnanthus species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
