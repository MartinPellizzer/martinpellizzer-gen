It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its roots are submerged, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas, impacting local ecosystems."
