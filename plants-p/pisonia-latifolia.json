    "intro": "Pisonia latifolia, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its thick, waxy leaves help it retain moisture in salty, coastal environments. Pisonia latifolia is often found growing in sandy soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
