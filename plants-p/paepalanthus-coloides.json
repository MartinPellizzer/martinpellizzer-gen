    "intro": "Paepalanthus coloides, commonly known as the silky oca, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, tuberous roots and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
