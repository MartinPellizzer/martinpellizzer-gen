    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. curtidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a fern with delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a lighter midrib. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, toothed pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to purify water in aquatic settings."
