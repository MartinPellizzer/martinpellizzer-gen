It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, white or yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its foliage is usually grey-green, with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Pimelea pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
