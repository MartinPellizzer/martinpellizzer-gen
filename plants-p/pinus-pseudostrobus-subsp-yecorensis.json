    "intro": "Pinus pseudostrobus subsp. yecorensis, commonly known as the Yecora pine, is a subspecies of the Mexican pine native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of this subspecies are generally smaller and more slender compared to those of the main species. It produces edible seeds that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived tree."
