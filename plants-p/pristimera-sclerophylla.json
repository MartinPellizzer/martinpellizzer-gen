It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a yellowish color. Pristimera sclerophylla is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
