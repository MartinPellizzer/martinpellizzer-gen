    "intro": "Penicillaria raddiana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Penicillaria raddiana is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater."
