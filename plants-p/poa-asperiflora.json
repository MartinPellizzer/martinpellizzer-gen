    "intro": "Poa asperiflora, commonly known as the rough-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue-green florets. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Poa asperiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
