    "intro": "Pappostipa ibarii var. anomala, commonly known as the Ibarian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
