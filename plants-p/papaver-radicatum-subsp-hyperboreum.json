    "intro": "Papaver radicatum subsp. hyperboreum, commonly known as the Arctic poppy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic regions and subarctic areas of northern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant plays an important role in the ecology of its habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
