    "intro": "Polycarpon prostratum var. littorale, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to coastal regions. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences. Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal ecosystems and it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
