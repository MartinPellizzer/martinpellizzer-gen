It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically longer and more rigid compared to other pine species. The cones of this subspecies are usually smaller and more pointed, with scales that open to release the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. The tree is valued for its timber and has ecological significance in its native habitats."
