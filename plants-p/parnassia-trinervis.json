    "intro": "Parnassia trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined parnassia, is a flowering plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking white, waxy flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green center. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, and are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Parnassia trinervis is part of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many other showy, often toxic plants."
