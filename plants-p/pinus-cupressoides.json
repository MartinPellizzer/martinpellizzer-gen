    "intro": "Pinus cupressoides, commonly known as the Spanish cedar or Mediterranean cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green and closely pressed together. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release winged seeds, facilitating wind pollination. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is not typically used for commercial timber. The plant plays an important ecological role in Mediterranean ecosystems, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
