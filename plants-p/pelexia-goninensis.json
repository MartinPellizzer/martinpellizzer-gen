    "intro": "Pelexia goninensis, commonly known as the Gonin's pelexia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in high-altitude, moist environments and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
