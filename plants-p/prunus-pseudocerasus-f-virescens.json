    "intro": "Prunus pseudocerasus f. virescens, commonly known as the green-leafed Chinese date or green plum, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus native to China. It is characterized by its distinctively bright green foliage, which contrasts with the typical red or purple leaves of other Prunus species. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant leaf color. The f. virescens form is a natural mutation that enhances its visual appeal in gardens and landscapes."
