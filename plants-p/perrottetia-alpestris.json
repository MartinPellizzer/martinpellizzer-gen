    "intro": "Perrottetia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine perrottetia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Perrottetia alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
