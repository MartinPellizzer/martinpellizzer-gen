    "intro": "Philadelphus acuminatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually narrower than those of other philadelphus species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
