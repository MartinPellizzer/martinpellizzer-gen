    "intro": "Pinus atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often covered in a thick, resinous coating, which helps protect the seeds from moisture and pests. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray and strong winds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
