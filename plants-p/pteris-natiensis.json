    "intro": "Pteris natiensis, commonly known as the New Zealand water fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris natiensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
