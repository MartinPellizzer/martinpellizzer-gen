It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually small and may be reduced or absent in mature plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
