    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides var. incisum, commonly known as the incised wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features a tall, upright rhizome with dark, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with the pinnae bearing toothed or lobed margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
