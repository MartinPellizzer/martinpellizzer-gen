    "intro": "Prosopis juliflora var. articulata, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by the development of long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It has deep roots that allow it to access groundwater, making it highly resilient to extreme conditions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
