    "intro": "Picea alba, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and grayish-blue foliage that turns a silvery white in winter. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming more fissured with age. The white spruce is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas."
