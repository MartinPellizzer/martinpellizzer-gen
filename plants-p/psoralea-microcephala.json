    "intro": "Psoralea microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed psoralea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a small annual herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
