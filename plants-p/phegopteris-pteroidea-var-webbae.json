    "intro": "Phegopteris pteroidea var. webbae, commonly known as the Webb's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
