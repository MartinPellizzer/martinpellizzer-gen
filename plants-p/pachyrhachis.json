It is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth habit and tall, cylindrical culms that often form dense clumps. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Pachyrhachis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, well-drained soils. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
