    "intro": "Pteridium latiusculum f. berdii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bracken, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This fern is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as an ornamental plant in horticulture."
