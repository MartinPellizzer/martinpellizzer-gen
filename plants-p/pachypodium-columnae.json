It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers during the dry season. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for xerophytic gardens and rockeries."
