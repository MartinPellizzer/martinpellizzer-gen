    "intro": "Phyllanthus fuscoluridus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy false crosswort, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
