    "intro": "Patellifolia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage close to the ground, with small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels above the leaves. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with succulent tissues that help store water. Patellifolia procumbens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
