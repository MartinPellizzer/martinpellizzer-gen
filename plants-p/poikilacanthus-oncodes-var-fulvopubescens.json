    "intro": "Poikilacanthus oncodes var. fulvopubescens, commonly known as the golden pubescent sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a reddish or purple tinge. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
