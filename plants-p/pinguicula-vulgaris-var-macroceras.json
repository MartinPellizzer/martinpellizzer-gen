    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. macroceras, commonly known as the large-capped butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap small insects. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, inflated calyx that resembles a small bell. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or boggy habitats. Its botanical features make it both an interesting subject for study and a unique addition to carnivorous plant collections."
