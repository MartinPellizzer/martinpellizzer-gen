    "intro": "Potentilla incanescens f. typica, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features finely divided, silver-hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens for its delicate appearance and hardy nature."
