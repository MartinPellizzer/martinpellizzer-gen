    "intro": "Pinus tropicalis, commonly known as the tropical pine, is a species of conifer native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 20 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a conical crown. The tree produces long, slender cones that contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing, which aids in wind dispersal. Its needles are clustered in bundles of five, and they are often a dark green color with a slight blue tint. The wood of Pinus tropicalis is valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
