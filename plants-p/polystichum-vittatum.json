    "intro": "Polystichum vittatum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are adorned with golden-yellow veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps over time. Polystichum vittatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
