    "intro": "Prangos deserti, commonly known as the desert globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions. The plant produces spherical, spiny seed heads that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Prangos deserti is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
