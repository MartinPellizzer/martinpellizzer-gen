It features a robust, upright rhizome with dark brown, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, giving the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
