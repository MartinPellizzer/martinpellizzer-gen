It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Phacelia hastata var. alpina is often found in alpine meadows and is an important component of mountain ecosystems."
