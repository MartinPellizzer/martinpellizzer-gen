    "intro": "Plantago lagopoda, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble the beard of a goat, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a protective, three-lobed structure called an ovary, and the plant is often found growing in moist, disturbed soils. Plantago lagopoda is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for various ailments."
