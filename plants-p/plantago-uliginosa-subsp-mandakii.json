    "intro": "Plantago uliginosa subsp. mandakii, commonly known as the marsh plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist soils. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
