It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and cooking. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, preferring well-drained sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched spike that bears small, fragrant flowers. The fruit, a spiny capsule, contains seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
