It features wiry, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white flowers in early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blossoms and compact growth habit."
