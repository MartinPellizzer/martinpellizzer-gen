    "intro": "Phalaris phleoides var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand phalaris, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silica. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion."
