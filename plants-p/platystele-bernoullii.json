    "intro": "Platystele bernoullii, commonly known as the Bernoulli's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a short, fleshy rhizome and a single, slender stem. The plant produces delicate, white to pale green flowers with three sepals and three petals, often with a distinct hood-like structure. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically in cloud forests, and requires specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and protected in several regions."
