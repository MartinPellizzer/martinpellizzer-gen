    "intro": "Polygonum argentum, commonly known as silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
