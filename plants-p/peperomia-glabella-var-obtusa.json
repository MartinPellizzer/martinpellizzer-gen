It features oval, waxy, and slightly fleshy leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a subtle sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often in shades of white or green, which are not particularly showy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a versatile plant for both novice and experienced growers."
