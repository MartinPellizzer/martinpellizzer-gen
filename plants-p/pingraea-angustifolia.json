    "intro": "Pingraea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pingraea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, arranged in a dense rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of wetland ecosystems."
