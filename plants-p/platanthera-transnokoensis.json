    "intro": "Platanthera transnokoensis, commonly known as the Transnoko twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions in Central Africa. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that supports a single, showy floral spike. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with purple or brown markings. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
