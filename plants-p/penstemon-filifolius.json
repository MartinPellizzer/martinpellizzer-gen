    "intro": "Penstemon filifolius, commonly known as the thread-leaved beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. This perennial species typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, such as slopes and cliffs. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. The plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
