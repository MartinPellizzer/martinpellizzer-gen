    "intro": "Piofontia alveolata, commonly known as the hollow-leaf piofontia, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, hollow stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often found in shaded woodland areas. Its leaves are narrow and ribbed, with a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. The flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. Piofontia alveolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
