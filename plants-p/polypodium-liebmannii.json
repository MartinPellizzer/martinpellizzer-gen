    "intro": "Polypodium liebmannii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock faces or in rocky crevices. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
