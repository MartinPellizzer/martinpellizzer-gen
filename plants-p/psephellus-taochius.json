    "intro": "Psephellus taochius, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the family Taxaceae, which includes other yew species known for their medicinal and ornamental uses. The plant is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
