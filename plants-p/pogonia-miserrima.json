    "intro": "Pogonia miserrima, commonly known as the sad pale orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its pale pink or white flowers with intricate patterns resembling veins, and its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, often near streams or in swampy areas. It has a short flowering period in late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia miserrima is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
