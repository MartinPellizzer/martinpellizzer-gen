    "intro": "Physocarpus intermedius, commonly known as ninebark, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, exfoliating bark that peels in papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Physocarpus intermedius is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
