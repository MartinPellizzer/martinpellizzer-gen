It is native to the rainforests of the Guyana Shield, particularly in Venezuela and Guyana. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It is often found growing in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
