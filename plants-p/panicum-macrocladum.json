    "intro": "Panicum macrocladum, commonly known as big bluestem, is a tallgrass native to the central United States. It is a warm-season grass characterized by its bluish-green foliage and distinctive, stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often a striking rust color in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it a valuable component of native prairie ecosystems. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and supports biodiversity in grassland habitats."
