    "intro": "Pyrrosia intermedia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia intermedia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in controlled indoor settings."
