    "intro": "Polychaetia passerinoides, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It features a compact, globular shape with a dense covering of yellowish-green spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for its epiphytic lifestyle. Due to its striking appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized succulent collections."
