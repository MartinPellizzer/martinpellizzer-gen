    "intro": "Polystichum caespitosum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. It features narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Polystichum caespitosum."
