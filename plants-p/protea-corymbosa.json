    "intro": "Protea corymbosa, commonly known as the sugarbowl protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a bowl or a cluster of candles, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant pink to red bracts that enclose small, tubular flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
