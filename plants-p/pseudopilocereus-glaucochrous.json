    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus glaucochrous, commonly known as the golden nightshade, is a flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer, providing food for wildlife."
