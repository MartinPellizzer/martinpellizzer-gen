    "intro": "Paspalum hirsutum, commonly known as hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wetland habitats and can tolerate a variety of soil conditions. Paspalum hirsutum is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
