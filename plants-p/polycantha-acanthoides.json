It features dense clusters of spiny, fleshy leaves that form a spherical or cylindrical shape, resembling a pincushion. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
