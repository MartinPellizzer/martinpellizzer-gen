    "intro": "Polypodium heteromorphum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from pinnate to bipinnate, depending on environmental conditions. The fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive holly-like appearance due to their serrated margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia."
