    "intro": "Phlomis umbrosa var. stenocalyx, commonly known as narrow-leaved phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flower clusters in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a valuable addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
