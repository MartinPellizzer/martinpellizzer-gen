    "intro": "Pronephrium clemensiae var. degener, commonly known as the Degener's bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its leaves are typically small and whorled, with the bladders located at the base of the stems. This variety is notable for its carnivorous adaptation, which aids in nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor waters."
