    "intro": "Plantago rigida, commonly known as rigid plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries."
