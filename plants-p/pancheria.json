It is characterized by its unique, showy, and often fragrant blooms that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant typically features palmately lobed leaves and produces capsules as its fruit type. Pancheria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
