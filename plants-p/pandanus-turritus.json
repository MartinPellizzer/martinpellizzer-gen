    "intro": "Pandanus turritus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a striking tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, spirally arranged leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, with clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching. Pandanus turritus thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
