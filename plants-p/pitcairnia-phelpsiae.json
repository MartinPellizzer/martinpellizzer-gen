    "intro": "Pitcairnia phelpsiae, commonly known as the Phelps' pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically stiff and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native high-altitude environment. Pitcairnia phelpsiae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
