    "intro": "Prunus obovata, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its obovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces showy, single or clustered flowers in shades of white to pink in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit, a small, yellow or orange drupe, ripens in summer and is edible. Prunus obovata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
