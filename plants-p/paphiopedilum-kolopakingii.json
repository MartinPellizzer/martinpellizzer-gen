    "intro": "Paphiopedilum kolopakingii, commonly known as the Kauai slipper orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap, a feature common among orchids in the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, with broad, leathery leaves and a compact growth habit. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a critically endangered species."
