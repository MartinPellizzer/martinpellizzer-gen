It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and compact, fountain-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that add ornamental value, especially in late summer and autumn. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Pennisetum dillonii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
