    "intro": "Polyosma scortechinii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules that open to release the seeds when mature. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
