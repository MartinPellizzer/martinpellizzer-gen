    "intro": "Pleurothallis pelicophora, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, velvety-textured flowers. The plant typically produces small, pendulous blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, which are often fragrant. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Pleurothallis pelicophora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
