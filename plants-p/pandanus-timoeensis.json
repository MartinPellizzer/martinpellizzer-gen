    "intro": "Pandanus timoeensis, commonly known as the Timor pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the island of Timor. It is a member of the Pandanus genus, characterized by its distinctive palm-like appearance and fibrous leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in humid, saline environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The Timor pandanus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local cultures."
