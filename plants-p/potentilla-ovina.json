    "intro": "Potentilla ovina, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft, woolly hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
