    "intro": "Pinus nigra, commonly known as the Italian stone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces large, edible pine cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange covering. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible nuts. Pinus nigra is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
