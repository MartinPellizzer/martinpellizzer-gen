    "intro": "Polypodium rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium rupicola plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
