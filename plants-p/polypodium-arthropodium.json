    "intro": "Polypodium arthropodium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium arthropodium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
