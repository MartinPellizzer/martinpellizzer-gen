It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
