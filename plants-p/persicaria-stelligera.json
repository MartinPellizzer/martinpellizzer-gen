    "intro": "Persicaria stelligera, commonly known as sea spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has erect, branched stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by four to five egg-shaped bracts. Persicaria stelligera is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
