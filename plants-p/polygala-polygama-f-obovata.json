    "intro": "Polygala polygama f. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically obovate, meaning they are broadest near the base, and the plant produces distinctive, spurred flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish-white. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
