    "intro": "Plectronia brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved plectronia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to habitat loss, Plectronia brevifolium is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
