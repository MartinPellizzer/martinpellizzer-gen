    "intro": "Populus qiongdaoensis, commonly known as the Qiongdao poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, while its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
