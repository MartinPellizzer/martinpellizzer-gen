    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. frumentacea, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a warm-season grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces long, bristly panicles that resemble a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy crop for arid environments. Its seeds are small, oval, and often used as a staple food in many parts of Asia. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
