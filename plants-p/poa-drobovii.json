    "intro": "Poa drobovii, commonly known as the Drobovii bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
