    "intro": "Pachystele livida, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and its unique, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It is a small shrub, typically growing to a height of about 1 meter, with a dense, compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pachystele livida is considered endangered and is protected in its natural range."
