    "intro": "Polypodium polylepis, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with numerous upright fronds that are pinnately compound and covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs. Its fronds are usually evergreen, and the plant reproduces via spores produced on the underside of its leaves. Polypodium polylepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
