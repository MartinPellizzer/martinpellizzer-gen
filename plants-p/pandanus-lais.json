It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces large, branched inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. Its fruits, which resemble small coconuts, are used for their fibrous husks and edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a hardy species in tropical regions."
