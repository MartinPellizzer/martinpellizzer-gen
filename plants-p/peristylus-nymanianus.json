    "intro": "Peristylus nymanianus, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in terminal clusters, which are often hidden among the foliage. Peristylus nymanianus is adapted to moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its fibrous leaves have historically been used by M\u0101ori for weaving and other traditional purposes."
