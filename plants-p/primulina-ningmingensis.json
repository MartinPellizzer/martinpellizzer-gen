It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, pale pubescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
