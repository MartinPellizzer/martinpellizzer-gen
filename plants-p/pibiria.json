    "intro": "Pibiria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, bioluminescent blooms that emit a faint glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or on the edges of glaciers. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of scientific interest and a symbol of ecological fragility. Due to habitat loss, the pibiria is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
