    "intro": "Polypodium tovarense, commonly known as the Tovarensis shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is short and thick, anchoring it to the substrate while supporting its growth. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
