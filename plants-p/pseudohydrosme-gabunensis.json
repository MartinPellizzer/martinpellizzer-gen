    "intro": "Pseudohydrosme gabunensis, commonly known as the Gabon hydrosme, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in the moist, shaded conditions of the forest floor. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
