    "intro": "Phyllostachys edulis f. bicolor, commonly known as the variegated bamboo, is a unique variant of the common bamboo species. It is characterized by its striking bicolor leaves, which display a mix of green and white or yellow patterns. This plant is a clumping bamboo, forming dense stands rather than spreading aggressively. The variegation is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll distribution. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes."
