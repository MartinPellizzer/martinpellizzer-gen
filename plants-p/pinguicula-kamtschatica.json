    "intro": "Pinguicula kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschatka butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Siberia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that grows in moist, rocky habitats, often in alpine or subalpine zones. The plant produces delicate, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms during the summer months. Pinguicula kamtschatica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with high humidity and limited sunlight."
