    "intro": "Pneumatopteris unita, commonly known as the single-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided with a single, prominent midrib and small, rounded lobes. Pneumatopteris unita thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes."
