    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. ambigua, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly underside on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
