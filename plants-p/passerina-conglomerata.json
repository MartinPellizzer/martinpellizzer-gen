    "intro": "Passerina conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and related species, and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Passerina conglomerata is known for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated in rock gardens for its ornamental value."
