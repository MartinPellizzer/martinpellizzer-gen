    "intro": "Potentilla arnavatensis, commonly known as the Armenian cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of five-petaled flowers. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Potentilla arnavatensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high altitudes, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
