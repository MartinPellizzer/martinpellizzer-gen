    "intro": "Polypodium castaneum, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like appearance."
