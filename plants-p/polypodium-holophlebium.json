    "intro": "Polypodium holophlebium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium holophlebium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
