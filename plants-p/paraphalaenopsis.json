    "intro": "Paraphalaenopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Unlike many orchids, it does not require a symbiotic relationship with fungi for nutrient uptake, which makes it unique in the orchid family. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its delicate appearance and elusive nature have made it a subject of both botanical study and conservation efforts."
