    "intro": "Pinus sacra, commonly known as the sacred pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its straight, cylindrical trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of five. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length, containing seeds surrounded by a resinous coating. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and pests. Pinus sacra is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental and historical significance."
