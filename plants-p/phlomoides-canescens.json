    "intro": "Phlomoides canescens, commonly known as the grayleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
