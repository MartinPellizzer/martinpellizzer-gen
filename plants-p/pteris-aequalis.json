    "intro": "Pteris aequalis, commonly known as the equal fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly wavy margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Pteris aequalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
