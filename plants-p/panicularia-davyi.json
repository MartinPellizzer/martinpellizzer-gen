    "intro": "Panicularia davyi, commonly known as the golden panicled grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, panicled inflorescence that turns golden in color as it matures. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are followed by fluffy seed heads that aid in seed dispersal. Panicularia davyi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
