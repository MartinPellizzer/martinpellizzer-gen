    "intro": "Parahebe derwentiana subsp. subglauca, commonly known as the silver parahebe, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the presence of fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
