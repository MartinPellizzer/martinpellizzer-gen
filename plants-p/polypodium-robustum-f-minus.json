    "intro": "Polypodium robustum f. minus, commonly known as the lesser rock fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and leathery, dark green fronds. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, linear segments with a distinctive, serrated margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or wooded slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
