    "intro": "Primula oresbia, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Primula oresbia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
