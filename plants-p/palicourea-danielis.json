It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
