    "intro": "Potentilla australis var. malyana, commonly known as the Malyana cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of hairs, providing it with a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with similar growing conditions."
