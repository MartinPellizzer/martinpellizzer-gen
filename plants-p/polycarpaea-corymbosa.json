    "intro": "Polycarpaea corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered polycarpaea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. Its flowers are borne in corymbs, which are flat-topped or rounded clusters, giving it its common name. Polycarpaea corymbosa is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
