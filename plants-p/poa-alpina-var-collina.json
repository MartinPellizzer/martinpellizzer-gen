    "intro": "Poa alpina var. collina, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh climates with its dense growth habit and ability to withstand strong winds. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
