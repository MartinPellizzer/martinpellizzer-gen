    "intro": "Planchonella paucinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined hibiscus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by yellow stamens. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Planchonella paucinervia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
