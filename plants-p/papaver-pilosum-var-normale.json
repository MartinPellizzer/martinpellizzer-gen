It features striking, bright red to orange flowers with a central crown of stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, often hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually green and slightly pubescent. Its capsule fruit contains numerous tiny, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind.
