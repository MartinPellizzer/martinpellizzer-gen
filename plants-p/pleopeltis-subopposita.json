    "intro": "Pleopeltis subopposita, commonly known as the opposite-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive arrangement of opposite leaflets. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
