    "intro": "Poa hosteana, commonly known as the Hoste's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest margins. The plant has a dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in compacted soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Poa hosteana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
