    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum var. paradiseae, commonly known as the paradise fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
