    "intro": "Pilosella sciadophora subsp. atschavica, commonly known as the Caucasian hairgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
