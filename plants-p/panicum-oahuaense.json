    "intro": "Panicum oahuaense, commonly known as the Hawaiian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
