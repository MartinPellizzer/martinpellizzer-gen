    "intro": "Phyllanthus squamifolius, commonly known as the squamifoliate phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered with a dense layer of fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along riverbanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a subject of interest in both ecological studies and traditional medicine."
