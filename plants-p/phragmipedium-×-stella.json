    "intro": "Phragmipedium \u00d7 stella, commonly known as the Stella orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Phragmipedium kovachii and Phragmipedium sanguinolentum. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, typical of many orchid genera, and produces a single, erect stem bearing a cluster of flowers. The plant's leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its upright growth habit. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light, and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. The flowers are usually pale yellow to orange with a distinctive red or purple lip, making it a visually striking ornamental plant."
