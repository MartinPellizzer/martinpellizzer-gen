    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
