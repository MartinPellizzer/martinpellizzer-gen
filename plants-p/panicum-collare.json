It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
