    "intro": "Phaseoloides extensum, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a fibrous pod, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, warm climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
