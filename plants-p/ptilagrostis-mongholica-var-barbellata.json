    "intro": "Ptilagrostis mongholica var. barbellata, commonly known as the Mongolian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often adorned with bristles. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and its potential for use in restoration projects."
