    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 donarium f. kosioyama, commonly known as the Kosioyama cherry, is a cultivated form of a hybrid cherry tree. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of semi-double pink flowers in early spring. The foliage is dark green and dense, providing an attractive backdrop to the blossoms. It is typically grown as a ornamental tree in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal. The fruit, while edible, is small and not particularly notable for culinary use."
