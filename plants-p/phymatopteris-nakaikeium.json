    "intro": "Phymatopteris nakaikeium, commonly known as the Nakai's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and small, orbicular to ovate-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically covered with a dense layer of pale, woolly hair, giving the plant a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family."
