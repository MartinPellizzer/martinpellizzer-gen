    "intro": "Parosela townsendii, commonly known as Townsend's parosela, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
