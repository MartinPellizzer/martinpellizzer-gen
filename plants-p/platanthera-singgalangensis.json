    "intro": "Platanthera singgalangensis, commonly known as the Singgalang lady's tresses, is an orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense, spike-like inflorescence adorned with small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often in areas with rich organic soil. It is a terrestrial orchid, meaning it grows from the ground rather than on trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
