The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in areas with acidic soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
