    "intro": "Polystichum torresianum, commonly known as the Torresian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
