    "intro": "Pseudotaxus chienii subsp. liana, commonly known as the liana pseudotaxus, is a rare and unique member of the Taxaceae family. It is characterized by its woody, climbing structure and is native to specific regions in China. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with persistent, scale-like leaves and produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
