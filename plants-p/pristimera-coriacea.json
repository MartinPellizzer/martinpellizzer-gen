    "intro": "Pristimera coriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed pristimera, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a rough, bark-like texture, which provides protection against environmental stress. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Pristimera coriacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
