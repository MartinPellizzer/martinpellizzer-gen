    "intro": "Potentilla sericea var. glabrata, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features silvery-white, woolly leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is drought-tolerant and has a compact growth habit, which makes it an attractive choice for gardeners in arid regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and long blooming period."
