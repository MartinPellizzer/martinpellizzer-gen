    "intro": "Potentilla saundersiana var. caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
