    "intro": "Prunus padus f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy white-flowering ash, is a botanical variant of the European ash tree. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent (hairy) leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin. This form is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
