It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, typically from May to June. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its elegant appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, bell-shaped blooms and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
