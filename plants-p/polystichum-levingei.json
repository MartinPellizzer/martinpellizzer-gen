    "intro": "Polystichum levingei, commonly known as the Levinge's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture, and they are arranged in a dense, compact rosette. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
