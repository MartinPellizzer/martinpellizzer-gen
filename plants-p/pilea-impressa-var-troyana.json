    "intro": "Pilea impressa var. troyana, commonly known as the Troyana Chinese evergreen, is a compact, low-growing plant native to China. It features oval, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a distinctive pattern of raised, sunken veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by pale green, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its attractive foliage and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
