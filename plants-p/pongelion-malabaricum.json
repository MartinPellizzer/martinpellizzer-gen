    "intro": "Pongelion malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
