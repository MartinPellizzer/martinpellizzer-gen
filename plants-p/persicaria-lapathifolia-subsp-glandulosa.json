    "intro": "Persicaria lapathifolia subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as glandular hogweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring erect, branched stems that are often hairy. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and prominent veins, and they are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, producing a showy display of white to pale pink blooms. The plant is characterized by the presence of glandular dots on its stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name."
