    "intro": "Pechuel-loeschea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and pale green, waxy leaves that resemble those of a ghostly apparition. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ethereal appearance. Pechuel-loeschea is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
