    "intro": "Planchonia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. The flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeycreepers, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
