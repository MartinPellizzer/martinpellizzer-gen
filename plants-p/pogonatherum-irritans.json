    "intro": "Pogonatherum irritans, commonly known as the prickly grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its stiff, bristly leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils effectively. Pogonatherum irritans is often found in open areas, lawns, and along roadsides, where it can become invasive in certain regions."
