It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to red, often resembling a torch. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold conditions of its native habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific climate requirements."
