    "intro": "Pontederia natans, commonly known as the floating heart, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful wetland plant and a potential invasive species."
