    "intro": "Poa malacantha, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, slightly hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa malacantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
