    "intro": "Palicourea puberulenta, commonly known as the velvet leaf or Brazilian velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
