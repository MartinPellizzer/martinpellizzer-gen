It produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its silver leaves provide ornamental value in gardens, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
