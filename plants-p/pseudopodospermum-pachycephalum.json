    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum pachycephalum, commonly known as the thick-headed pachycephalum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is known for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
