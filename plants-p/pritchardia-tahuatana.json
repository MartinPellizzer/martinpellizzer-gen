    "intro": "Pritchardia tahuatana, commonly known as the Tahuata palm, is a species of cycad found in the Society Islands of French Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feather-like fronds that grow in a dense, fan-shaped arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
