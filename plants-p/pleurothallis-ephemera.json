    "intro": "Pleurothallis ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming briefly during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
