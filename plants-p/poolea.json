    "intro": "Poolea, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and compact growth habit, often forming rosettes. Many species are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick leaves. They typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Poolea species are popular in rock gardens and as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
