    "intro": "Polypodium senile var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf hart's-tongue fern, is a variant of the hart's-tongue fern native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its narrow, leathery, and evergreen fronds that remain on the plant year-round. The fronds are typically short and curling, with a distinctive shape that resembles a tongue or a heart. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in woodland areas. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients."
