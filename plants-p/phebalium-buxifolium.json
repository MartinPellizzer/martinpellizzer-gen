    "intro": "Phebalium buxifolium, commonly known as the box-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
