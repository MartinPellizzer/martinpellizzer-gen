    "intro": "Phoradendron carinatum, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive ridge-like structure, giving it its scientific name. The coral tree is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments."
