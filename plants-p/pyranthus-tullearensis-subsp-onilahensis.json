    "intro": "Pyranthus tullearensis subsp. onilahensis, commonly known as the Onilahena pyranthus, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
