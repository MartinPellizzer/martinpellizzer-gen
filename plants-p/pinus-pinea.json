    "intro": "Pinus pinea, commonly known as the Italian stone pine, is a species of pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive, fan-shaped foliage. The plant produces long, cylindrical cones that contain edible seeds, known as pignoli or pine nuts. Its leaves are needle-like, typically growing in pairs, and are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The Italian stone pine is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nut production."
