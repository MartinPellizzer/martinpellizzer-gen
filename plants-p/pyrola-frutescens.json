    "intro": "Pyrola frutescens, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters and features dense, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the winter. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its aromatic properties. Pyrola frutescens thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats and is adapted to cool, humid climates."
