    "intro": "Pritchardia affinis var. holaphila, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique climatic conditions of the Hawaiian highlands. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
