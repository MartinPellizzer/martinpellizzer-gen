    "intro": "Paullinia tenera, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant belonging to the Sapindaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in certain regions."
