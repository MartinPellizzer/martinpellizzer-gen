    "intro": "Petalidium wilmaniae, commonly known as the Wilman's petalidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are predominantly pink or purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
