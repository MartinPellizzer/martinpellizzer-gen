    "intro": "Polygala japonica f. nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its foliage consists of narrow, elongated leaves that are often arranged in pairs along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
