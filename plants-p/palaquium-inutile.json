    "intro": "Palaquium inutile, commonly known as the useless palaquium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. The fruit contains a single seed and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Palaquium inutile is considered a rare and less-studied species."
