    "intro": "Pleuropappus phyllocalymmeus, commonly known as the narrowleaf pleuropappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces bract-like structures known as pappus, which aid in seed dispersal. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands at higher elevations."
