    "intro": "Primula petrocharis, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, sunny conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
