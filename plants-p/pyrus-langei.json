    "intro": "Pyrus langei, commonly known as the Lange's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible but not widely cultivated. Pyrus langei is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
