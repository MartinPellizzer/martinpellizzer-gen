It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue or white flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low temperatures and short growing seasons. Pulsatilloides gelida is an important component of Arctic ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in fragile habitats."
