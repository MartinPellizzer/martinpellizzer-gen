    "intro": "Phreatia minahassae, commonly known as the Minahassa orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
