    "intro": "Potentilla calycina f. eremitica, commonly known as the Desert cinquefoil, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters of five. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control in harsh climates."
