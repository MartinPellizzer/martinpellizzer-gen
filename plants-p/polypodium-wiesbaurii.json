    "intro": "Polypodium wiesbaurii, commonly known as the Wiesbaur's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are often dark green with a waxy texture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium wiesbaurii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
