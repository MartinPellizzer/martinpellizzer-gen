    "intro": "Psoralea fruticans, commonly known as the hairy psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are accompanied by small, hairy leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Psoralea fruticans is known for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
