    "intro": "Picris integrifolia, commonly known as goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter foliage. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas, and is often found along roadsides. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
