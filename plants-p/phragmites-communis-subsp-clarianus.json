    "intro": "Phragmites communis subsp. clarianus, commonly known as the tall glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline or brackish wetlands. It forms dense stands in coastal areas, marshes, and estuaries, often dominating the vegetation in such environments. The plant has tall, reed-like stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, and its leaves are narrow and fibrous. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. This subspecies is important for stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
