    "intro": "Pseudostellaria polymorpha, commonly known as the many-forms starwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to eastern Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces delicate white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Pseudostellaria polymorpha is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
