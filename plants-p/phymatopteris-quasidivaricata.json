    "intro": "Phymatopteris quasidivaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wallriven fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in Georgia and Florida. This fern is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are often recurved and have a distinctive, finely toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, which is a common feature among ferns."
