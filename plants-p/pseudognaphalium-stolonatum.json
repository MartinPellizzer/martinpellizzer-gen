    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium stolonatum, commonly known as the creeping everlasting or stoloniferous everlasting, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically yellow or white, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Pseudognaphalium stolonatum spreads via stolons, forming dense mats on the ground, and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions."
