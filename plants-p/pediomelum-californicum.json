    "intro": "Pediomelum californicum, commonly known as the California pediomelum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of California. It features slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
