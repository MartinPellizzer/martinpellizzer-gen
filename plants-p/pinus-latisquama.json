It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown and have a distinctive, elongated shape. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and insect damage. This species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
