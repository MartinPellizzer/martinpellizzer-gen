    "intro": "Poa brachyglossa, commonly known as the short-lipped bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to four florets, which are often inconspicuous and borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and open woodlands. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
