    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. hastata, commonly known as the balsam poplar, is a variant of the balsam poplar species native to North America. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
