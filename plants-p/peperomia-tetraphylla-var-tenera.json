    "intro": "Peperomia tetraphylla var. tenera, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green, velvety leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
