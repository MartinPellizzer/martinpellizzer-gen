    "intro": "Pleurosorus papaverifolius var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf peppergrass, is a low-growing fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u8338\u6bdb, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus, typically located on the underside of the fronds. It is native to parts of North America and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
