    "intro": "Pityrogramma \u00d7 nicaraguensis, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Pityrogramma calomelanos and Pityrogramma mirabilis. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments."
