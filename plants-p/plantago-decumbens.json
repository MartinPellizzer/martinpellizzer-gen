    "intro": "Plantago decumbens, commonly known as creeping plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks rising from the leaf axils. It is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and other urban environments. The leaves and seeds of Plantago decumbens have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
