    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa var. genuina, commonly known as the glandular cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves with glandular dots, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
