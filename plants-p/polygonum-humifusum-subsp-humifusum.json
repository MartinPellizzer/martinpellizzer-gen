It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, often with toothed margins, and are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
