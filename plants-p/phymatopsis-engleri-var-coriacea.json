    "intro": "Phymatopsis engleri var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough phymatopsis, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody, branching stems and small, leathery leaves that are covered in a thick, rough texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is an important component of local ecosystems."
