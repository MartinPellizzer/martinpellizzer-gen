    "intro": "Pueraria wallichii var. composita, commonly known as the Chinese kudzu or broad-leaf kudzu, is a perennial vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth, with large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
