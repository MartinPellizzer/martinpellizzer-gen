    "intro": "Puya nitida var. glabrior, commonly known as the glabrous puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular inflorescences. The plant produces vibrant, often colorful flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette, forming a dense canopy that helps retain moisture. This variety is noted for its reduced pubescence, giving it a smooth, glossy appearance compared to other Puya species."
