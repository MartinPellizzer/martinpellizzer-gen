    "intro": "Pellaea lomariacea var. itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia fern, is a variant of the common rock fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
