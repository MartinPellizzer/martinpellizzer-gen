    "intro": "Potentilla dickinsii var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, ovate leaves that are often densely covered with fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
