    "intro": "Poa hypnoides var. laxa, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils."
