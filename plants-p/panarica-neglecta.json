    "intro": "Panarica neglecta, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Panarica neglecta is often found in sandy soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
