    "intro": "Pentaphorus foliolosus, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite, simple, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to North America and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
