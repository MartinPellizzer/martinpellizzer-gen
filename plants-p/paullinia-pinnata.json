    "intro": "Paullinia pinnata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Paullinia pinnata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rainforests and coastal areas. Its ornamental value has led to its introduction in other parts of the world, where it can become an invasive species."
