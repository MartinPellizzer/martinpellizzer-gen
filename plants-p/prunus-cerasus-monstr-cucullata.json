    "intro": "Prunus cerasus monstr. cucullata, commonly known as the hooded cherry, is a unique cultivar of the cherry tree characterized by its distinctive, hood-like foliage. This plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking leaf shape and delicate pink flowers. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while the flowers appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It is typically grown as a decorative plant in gardens and is well-suited to temperate climates. The fruit, though edible, is generally small and not as prized for culinary use as other cherry varieties."
