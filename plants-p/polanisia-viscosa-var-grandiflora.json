    "intro": "Polanisia viscosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, often reaching several feet in height. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates with rich, well-draining soil. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
