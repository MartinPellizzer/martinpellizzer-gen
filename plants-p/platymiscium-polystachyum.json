It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant relies on host trees for nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship that can impact forest ecosystems. Its fruits are typically small berries that attract birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
