    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens, commonly known as the slender cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help it withstand cold temperatures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. Potentilla caulescens is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing rocky and sandy habitats."
