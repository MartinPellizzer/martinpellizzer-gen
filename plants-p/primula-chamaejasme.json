    "intro": "Primula chamaejasme, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and white, which bloom in early spring. Its foliage consists of oval, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Primula chamaejasme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and early blooming habit."
