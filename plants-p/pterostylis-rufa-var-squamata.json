    "intro": "Pterostylis rufa var. squamata, commonly known as the red-stemmed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, often reddish stem and produces small, greenish or brownish flowers clustered at the base. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, scaly texture, giving it its specific epithet \"squamata.\" The orchid relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchid species."
