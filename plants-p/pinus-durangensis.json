    "intro": "Pinus durangensis, commonly known as the Durango pine, is a species of conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that are woody and can persist on the tree for several years. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist conditions. The Durango pine plays a significant role in its native ecosystem, providing habitat and contributing to local biodiversity."
