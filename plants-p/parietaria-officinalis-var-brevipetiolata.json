    "intro": "Parietaria officinalis var. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The leaves are usually heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant produces greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. This variant is notable for its shorter petioles compared to the typical form of Parietaria officinalis."
