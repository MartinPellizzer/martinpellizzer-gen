    "intro": "Psychotria elephantina, commonly known as the elephant's ear or giant psychotria, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, giving it a dramatic and imposing appearance. The plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species, many of which are known for their ornamental or medicinal properties. Psychotria elephantina is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers, which are small and inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent watering to maintain its lush, vibrant appearance."
