    "intro": "Philodendron ghiesbrechtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbrecht's philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
