    "intro": "Pouzolzia frondosa var. waitziana, commonly known as the Waitzian fan-fern, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fan-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
