    "intro": "Pedicularis dolichocymba, commonly known as the long-lipped monkey orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including parts of the Alps and the Carpathians. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive long, slender lip. It grows in rocky or alpine habitats and is often found in open meadows or forest edges. Pedicularis dolichocymba is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing photosynthesis."
