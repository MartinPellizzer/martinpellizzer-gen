    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens subsp. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with erect, hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces fruiting structures known as achenes. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in mountainous environments."
