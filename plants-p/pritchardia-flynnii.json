    "intro": "Pritchardia flynnii, commonly known as the Hawaiian silver palm, is a species of cycad native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 6 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, Pritchardia flynnii is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
