    "intro": "Puya alba, commonly known as the white torch cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces tall, erect stems covered in dense, fibrous leaves that help it retain water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Puya alba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils with ample sunlight."
