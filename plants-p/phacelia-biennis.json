The plant has heart-shaped to ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Phacelia biennis is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is known for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and soil stabilization properties."
