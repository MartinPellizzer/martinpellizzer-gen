    "intro": "Polypodium simacense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some Southeast Asian countries. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns."
