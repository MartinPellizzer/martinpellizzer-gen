    "intro": "Psilochenia modocensis, commonly known as Modoc pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to a small region in California. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of many coniferous species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
