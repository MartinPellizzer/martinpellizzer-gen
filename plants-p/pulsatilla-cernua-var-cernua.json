It is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves that form a rosette and its distinctive, nodding, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy, often toxic flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
