    "intro": "Pilea microphylla var. herniarioides, commonly known as the Chinese money plant or pancake plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, round leaves that resemble small pancakes, which are typically a deep green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. This variety is known for its ease of care and ability to propagate through stem cuttings."
