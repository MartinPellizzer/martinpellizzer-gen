    "intro": "Pteris excelsa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance."
