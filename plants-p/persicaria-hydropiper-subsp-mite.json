    "intro": "Persicaria hydropiper subsp. mite, commonly known as water pepper, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments. It features slender, branching stems that often grow from the base, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on tall, slender inflorescences. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
