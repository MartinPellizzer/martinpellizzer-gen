    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This variant is distinguished by its vivid orange to yellow flowers, which contrast with its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
