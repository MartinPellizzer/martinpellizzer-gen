    "intro": "Phyllocytisus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
