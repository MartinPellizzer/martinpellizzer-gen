    "intro": "Phlomoides rotata, commonly known as silverleaf phlomoides, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features finely divided, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
