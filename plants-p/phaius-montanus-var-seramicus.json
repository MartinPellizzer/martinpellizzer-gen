    "intro": "Phaius montanus var. seramicus, commonly known as the Seram orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Seram in Indonesia. It is characterized by its robust rhizomes and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, large, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting purple or red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
