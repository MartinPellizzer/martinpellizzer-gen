It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
