    "intro": "Plectranthus margeritae, commonly known as the marguerite plectranthus, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive silver or grayish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and the delicate floral display it offers during the growing season."
