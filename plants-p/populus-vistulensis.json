    "intro": "Populus vistulensis, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are heart-shaped with a pointed tip and are often lobed, providing a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas."
