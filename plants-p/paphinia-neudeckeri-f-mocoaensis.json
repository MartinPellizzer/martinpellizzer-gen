    "intro": "Paphinia neudeckeri f. mocoaensis, commonly known as the Mocoa paphinia, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Andean cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences and vibrant, often bi-colored flowers that display a striking combination of purple, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate species that is highly sensitive to environmental changes."
