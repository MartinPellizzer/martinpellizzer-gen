    "intro": "Persica sanguinea, commonly known as the blood peach, is a rare and striking species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in early spring, which are often more showy than those of other peach species. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically reddish in color, though they are less commonly cultivated for consumption compared to other peaches. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slight pubescence. Persica sanguinea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its unique floral display."
