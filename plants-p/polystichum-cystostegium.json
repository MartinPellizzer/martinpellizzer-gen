    "intro": "Polystichum cystostegium, commonly known as the broad-leafed woodfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, with a dark green to blackish coloration on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous covering."
