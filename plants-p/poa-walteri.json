    "intro": "Poa walteri, commonly known as Walter's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has slender, tufted culms with fine, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Poa walteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
