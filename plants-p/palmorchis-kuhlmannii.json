    "intro": "Palmorchis kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, white flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in pine flatwoods or wetlands, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and limited distribution, making it a focus of botanical research and conservation efforts. The species is notable for its rarity and ecological significance in its native range."
