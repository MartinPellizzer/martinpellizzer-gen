    "intro": "Pleopeltis polypodioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often grow on rocks or trees. The plant has a rhizome that is covered with a thick, leathery layer, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments and are often covered with fine hairs. Pleopeltis polypodioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
