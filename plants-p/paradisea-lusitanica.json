    "intro": "Paradisea lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian paradisea, is a rare and striking plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring, producing clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that attract various pollinators. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
