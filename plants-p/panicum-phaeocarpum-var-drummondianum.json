    "intro": "Panicum phaeocarpum var. drummondianum, commonly known as Drummond's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often produce panicles of small, pale green to golden flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in native plant landscaping for its ornamental value. Drummond's panicgrass is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
