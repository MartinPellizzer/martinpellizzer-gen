    "intro": "Polygala humbertii var. crinigera, commonly known as the silky polygala, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid conditions. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
