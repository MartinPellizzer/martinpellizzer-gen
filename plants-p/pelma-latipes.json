    "intro": "Pelma latipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf pelma, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are often pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelma latipes is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
