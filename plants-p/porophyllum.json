    "intro": "Porophyllum, commonly known as Mexican sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Mexico and the southwestern United States. They are characterized by their vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Porophyllum species typically grow as annuals or perennials, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, and the plants are well adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
