    "intro": "Puria, commonly known as the Indian nettle or *Urtica dioica*, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. Puria is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
