    "intro": "Pteris ophioderma, commonly known as the thread-fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that resemble threads. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a fine, feathery appearance. Pteris ophioderma thrives in humid conditions and is often found in shaded, damp areas such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
