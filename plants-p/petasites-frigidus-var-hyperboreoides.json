    "intro": "Petasites frigidus var. hyperboreoides, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, and its yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to survive in harsh, cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
