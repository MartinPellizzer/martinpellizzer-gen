    "intro": "Polygonum longiflorum, commonly known as the Chinese knotweed or red root, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features striking, bright red to pink flowers that bloom in dense, cylindrical clusters, often resembling small torches. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, contributing to its vigorous growth and ability to spread readily. Polygonum longiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for various health purposes."
