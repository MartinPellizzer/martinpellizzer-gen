    "intro": "Petrorhagia fasciculata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Petrorhagia fasciculata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
