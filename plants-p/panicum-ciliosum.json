    "intro": "Panicum ciliosum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, silky appearance, and its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its ornamental value has also led to its use in native plant gardens."
