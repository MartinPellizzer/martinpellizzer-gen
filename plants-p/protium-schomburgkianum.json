    "intro": "Protium schomburgkianum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is a member of the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lanceolate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it an important commercial species. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered vulnerable in some regions."
