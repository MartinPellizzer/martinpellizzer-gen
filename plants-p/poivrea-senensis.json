    "intro": "Poivrea senensis, commonly known as the Senese privet, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature. Poivrea senensis is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and urban environments."
