    "intro": "Platycarya strobilacea, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a unique gymnosperm native to China. It is characterized by its stout, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in the wild."
