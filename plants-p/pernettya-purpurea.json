    "intro": "Pernettya purpurea, commonly known as the purple pernettya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cold climates of northern Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, providing dense foliage. Its berries are small, dark purple, and edible, though they are not widely consumed by humans. Pernettya purpurea thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas or rocky habitats."
