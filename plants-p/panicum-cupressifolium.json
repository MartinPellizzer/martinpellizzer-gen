    "intro": "Panicum cupressifolium, commonly known as coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that resemble those of cypress trees, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It produces small, blue-green inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowers. This species plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas."
