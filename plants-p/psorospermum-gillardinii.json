    "intro": "Psorospermum gillardinii, commonly known as the Christmas bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces black, spherical berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and moist forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
