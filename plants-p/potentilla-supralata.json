    "intro": "Potentilla supralata, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Potentilla supralata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
