    "intro": "Potentilla nivea subsp. kuznetzowii, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-white, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations, where it forms dense mats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
