    "intro": "Pinus merkusiana, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially green but turn brown as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The Corsican pine is valued for its timber and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitat."
