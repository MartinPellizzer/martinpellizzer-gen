    "intro": "Poa wyomingensis, commonly known as Wyoming bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, sod-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. Its leaves are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Wyoming bluegrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
