It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
