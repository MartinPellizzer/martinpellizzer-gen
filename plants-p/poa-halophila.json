    "intro": "Poa halophila, commonly known as salt meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is adapted to saline environments and thrives in wet, brackish soils, often found in marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
