    "intro": "Pterostylis setifera, commonly known as the slender-lobed greenhood, is an orchid native to eastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a single, upright stem that bears a single, hooded flower. The plant has a fleshy, tuberous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flower has a distinctive greenish-yellow color and a hood-like structure that encloses the reproductive organs. Pterostylis setifera is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats."
