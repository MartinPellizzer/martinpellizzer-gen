    "intro": "Petracanthus, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and is native to regions with rocky or arid soils, primarily in Africa and the Middle East. The plants typically have woody stems and produce showy, often colorful flowers that bloom in summer. They are adapted to survive in harsh environments, with some species exhibiting succulent leaves to store water. Petracanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their resilience and aesthetic qualities."
