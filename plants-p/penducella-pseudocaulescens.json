    "intro": "Penducella pseudocaulescens, commonly known as the false stemless penduncle, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with the leaves directly arising from the root system. The plant produces small, umbellate inflorescences that are often borne on long, pendulous stalks. Its foliage is typically finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. This species is native to certain regions of South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
