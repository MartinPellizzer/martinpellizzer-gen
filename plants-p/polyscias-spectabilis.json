    "intro": "Polyscias spectabilis, commonly known as the showy glory bush, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in subtropical gardens. Polyscias spectabilis is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
