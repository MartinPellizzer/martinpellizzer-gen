    "intro": "Pleurothallis wrightii, commonly known as Wright's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often with a fragrant aroma. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
