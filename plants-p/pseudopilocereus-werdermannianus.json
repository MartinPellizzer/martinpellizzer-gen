    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus werdermannianus, commonly known as the Werdermann's night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are capable of storing water. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth is typically slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in arid or semi-arid environments."
