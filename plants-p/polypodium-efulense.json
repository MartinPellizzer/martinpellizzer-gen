    "intro": "Polypodium efulense, commonly known as the Congo fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fronds that are leathery and often have a distinctive, serrated appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium efulense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
