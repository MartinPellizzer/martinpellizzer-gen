    "intro": "Podandrogyne plurivalvis, commonly known as the many-valved podandrogyne, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, multi-valved fruit structure that opens in a complex manner, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant exhibits a combination of male and female reproductive structures within the same individual, a trait known as androdioecy. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a smooth texture and a moderate degree of pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
