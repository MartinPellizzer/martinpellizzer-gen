    "intro": "Polypodium glaucum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically light green to bluish-gray in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Polypodium glaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
