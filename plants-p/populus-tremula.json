    "intro": "Populus tremula, commonly known as the trembling aspen, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that tremble in the wind. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often forms extensive clonal colonies through its root system. Populus tremula is valued for its rapid growth and is used in reforestation and ornamental landscaping."
