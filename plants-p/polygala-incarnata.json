    "intro": "Polygala incarnata, commonly known as the pink milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and slightly hairy, while its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, dark seeds. Polygala incarnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
