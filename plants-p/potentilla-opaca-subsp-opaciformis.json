    "intro": "Potentilla opaca subsp. opaciformis, commonly known as the opaciform rose. This subspecies is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
