    "intro": "Pulmonaria gracilis, commonly known as slender lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with pink or purple. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage and floral display make it a valuable addition to native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
