    "intro": "Puya suberosa, commonly known as the Chilean torchflower, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of Chile. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces vibrant red and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Puya suberosa is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils."
