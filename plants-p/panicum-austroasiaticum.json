    "intro": "Panicum austroasiaticum, commonly known as the Asian panic grass, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
