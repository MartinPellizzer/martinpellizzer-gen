    "intro": "Potamogeton filiformis proles amblyophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often less than 1 mm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually arranged in spike-like clusters. Its roots form dense mats that can help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. It is often found in lakes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers."
