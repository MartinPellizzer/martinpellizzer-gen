    "intro": "Pedilonum retroflexum, commonly known as the backward-pointing slipper orchid, is a unique species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped pouch that opens at the back, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The botanical features of Pedilonum retroflexum make it a fascinating subject for study in both horticulture and evolutionary biology."
