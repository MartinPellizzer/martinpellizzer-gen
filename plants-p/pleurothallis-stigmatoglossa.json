    "intro": "Pleurothallis stigmatoglossa, commonly known as the spotted lip orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, relying on its roots for anchorage rather than soil. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellowish spot on the lip, which is a characteristic feature of the genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
