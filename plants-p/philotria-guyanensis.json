    "intro": "Philotria guyanensis, commonly known as the Guyana philotria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Guyana and the Amazon region. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with thick, woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central column, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
