    "intro": "Physospermum cornubiense, commonly known as the Cornish physospermum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western region of England. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
