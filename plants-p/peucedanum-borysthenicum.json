It features slender, branching stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small, ovoid, and often have a pungent scent. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
