    "intro": "Pimelandra myristicifolia, commonly known as the golden torch ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often hidden within the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Pimelandra myristicifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
