    "intro": "Psathyrostachys fragilis subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its subspecific name. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or red hues. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and potential use in restoration projects."
