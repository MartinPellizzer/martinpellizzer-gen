    "intro": "Phebalium glandulosum subsp. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered phebalium, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its glandular leaves and showy, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. Its flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and the subspecies is distinguished by its larger floral size compared to other members of the species. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
