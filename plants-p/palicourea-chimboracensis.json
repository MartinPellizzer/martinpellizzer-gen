    "intro": "Palicourea chimboracensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian palicourea, is a shrub native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
