    "intro": "Philibertia crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf filbert, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
