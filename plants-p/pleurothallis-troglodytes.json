    "intro": "Pleurothallis troglodytes, commonly known as the cave orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It is characterized by its unique adaptations to cave-like conditions, including its ability to survive in low-light environments. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
