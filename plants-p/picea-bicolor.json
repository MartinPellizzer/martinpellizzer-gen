    "intro": "Picea bicolor, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its white- to silver-colored bark, which becomes flaky and fissured with age. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites and is often found in boreal and subalpine regions. The white spruce is an important species for both ecological and commercial purposes, including timber and habitat provision."
