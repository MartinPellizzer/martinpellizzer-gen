    "intro": "Polychilos parishii, commonly known as the New Zealand polychilos, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the plant family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
