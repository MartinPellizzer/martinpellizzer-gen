    "intro": "Polypodium deltodon, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky soils or in forest understories. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a long, narrow rachis and lanceolate pinnae. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. Polypodium deltodon plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
