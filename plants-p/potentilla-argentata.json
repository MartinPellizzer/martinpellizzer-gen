    "intro": "Potentilla argentata, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
