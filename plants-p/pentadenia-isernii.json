    "intro": "Pentadenia isernii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark and small, glossy leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
