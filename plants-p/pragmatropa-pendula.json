    "intro": "Pragmatropa pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and elegant look. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically lance-shaped with a smooth margin. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near rivers, ponds, or in wetlands."
