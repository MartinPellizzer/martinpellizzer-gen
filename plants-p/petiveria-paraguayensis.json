    "intro": "Petiveria paraguayensis, commonly known as Paraguay nettle, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks. It has a hairy stem and is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. Petiveria paraguayensis is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
