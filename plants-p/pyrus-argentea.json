    "intro": "Pyrus argentea, commonly known as the silverleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible pears that are typically small and tart. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. The silverleaf pear is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in horticultural breeding programs."
