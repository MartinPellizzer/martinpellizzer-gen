These plants are characterized by their hairy, leafy stems and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or yellow. Pilosella species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, thriving in temperate climates. They have a compact growth habit and are sometimes used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The genus includes around 60 species, many of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North America."
