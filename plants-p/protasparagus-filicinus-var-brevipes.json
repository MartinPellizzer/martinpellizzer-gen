    "intro": "Protasparagus filicinus var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and intricate, lace-like foliage. The plant features small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to white flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and strap-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
