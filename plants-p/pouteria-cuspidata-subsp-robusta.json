    "intro": "Pouteria cuspidata subsp. robusta, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces a heavy, woody fruit that contains up to 20 seeds. The fruit's outer husk is thick and hard, while the inner kernel is rich in oils and proteins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is an economically important species due to the high value of its seeds, which are harvested for food and oil production."
