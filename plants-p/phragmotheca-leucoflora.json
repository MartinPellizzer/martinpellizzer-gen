    "intro": "Phragmotheca leucoflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate plant found in wetland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
