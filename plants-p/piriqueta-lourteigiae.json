    "intro": "Piriqueta lourteigiae, commonly known as the Lourteig's piriqueta, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or humid woodlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a distinct, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
