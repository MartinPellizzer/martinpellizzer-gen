    "intro": "Pyrethrum dolomiticum, commonly known as Dolomitic Pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is known for its high concentration of pyrethrins, which are natural insecticides used in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its medicinal and pesticidal properties, it is cultivated for both ornamental and practical purposes."
