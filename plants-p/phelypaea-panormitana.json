    "intro": "Phelypaea panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitan fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
