    "intro": "Prunus spinosa proles parviflora, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. These flowers give way to small, dark purple berries known as drupes, which ripen in late summer. The plant is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other disturbed or marginal habitats."
