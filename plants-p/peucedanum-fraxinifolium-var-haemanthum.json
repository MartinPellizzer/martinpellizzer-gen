    "intro": "Peucedanum fraxinifolium var. haemanthum, commonly known as the yellow angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, pinnately compound leaves that resemble those of the ash tree. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
