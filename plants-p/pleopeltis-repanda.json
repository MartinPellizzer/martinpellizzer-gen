    "intro": "Pleopeltis repanda, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its leaves are usually divided into lance-shaped segments with a prominent midrib. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
