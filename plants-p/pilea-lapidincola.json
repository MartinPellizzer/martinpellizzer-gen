    "intro": "Pilea lapidincola, commonly known as the stone pilea, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded, with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea lapidincola is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
