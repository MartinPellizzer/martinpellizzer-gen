    "intro": "Peliosanthes cambodiana, commonly known as Cambodian sandalwood, is a rare and valuable tree native to Cambodia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly sought after for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in lowland evergreen forests and has a slow growth rate, making it vulnerable to overharvesting. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits. Due to its ecological and economic importance, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
