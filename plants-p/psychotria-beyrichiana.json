    "intro": "Psychotria beyrichiana, commonly known as the \"Lucky Plant\" or \"Mam\u00e1 de la Tierra,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Psychotria beyrichiana is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
