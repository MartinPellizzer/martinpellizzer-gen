    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion ovatum subsp. maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by narrow, silver-gray bracts. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with maritime climates."
