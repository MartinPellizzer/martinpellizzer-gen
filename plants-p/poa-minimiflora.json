    "intro": "Poa minimiflora, commonly known as the dwarf floret grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It features slender, tufted culms with small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are adapted for efficient seed dispersal in its native habitat. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. Poa minimiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops."
