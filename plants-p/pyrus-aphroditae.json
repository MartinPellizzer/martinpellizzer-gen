    "intro": "Pyrus aphroditae, commonly known as the Venus's pear, is a rare and distinctive species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible pomes that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in volcanic soils and is adapted to the unique climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pyrus aphroditae is considered a vulnerable species."
