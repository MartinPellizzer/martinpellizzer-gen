    "intro": "Polypodium auratum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slight metallic sheen. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polypodium auratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
