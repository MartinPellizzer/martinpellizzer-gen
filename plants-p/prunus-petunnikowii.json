    "intro": "Prunus petunnikowii, commonly known as the Turkmenian cherry, is a rare and small deciduous shrub native to Central Asia. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with its deep root system. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are used in local cuisines. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prunus petunnikowii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
