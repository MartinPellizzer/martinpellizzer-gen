It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
