It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, and it produces small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
