It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that attract various pollinators.
