    "intro": "Pycnanthus kombo var. sphaerocarpus, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that appear in winter, giving it its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly pubescent surface. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
