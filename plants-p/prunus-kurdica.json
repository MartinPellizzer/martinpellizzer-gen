    "intro": "Prunus kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish cherry, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, Iran, and the Caucasus. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a small, edible drupe, similar to cherries, with a sweet, tart flavor. It is often found growing in rocky or forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. Prunus kurdica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
