    "intro": "Panicum glaucum var. humifusum, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in ornamental gardening for their visual appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
