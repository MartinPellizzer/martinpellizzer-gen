    "intro": "Pennisetum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian feather grass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it produces delicate, panicle-shaped inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements. Pennisetum peruvianum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
