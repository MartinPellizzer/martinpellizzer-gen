    "intro": "Poecilopteris costata, commonly known as the serrated cliff fern, is a fossilized plant from the Paleozoic era. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system, typical of early ferns, which allowed it to thrive in swampy environments. Its leaves are preserved in various sedimentary rock formations, providing insights into ancient ecosystems. Poecilopteris costata is an important index fossil for dating and correlating geological strata from the Carboniferous period."
