    "intro": "Polygala schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
