    "intro": "Poa tef, commonly known as false wheat, is a grass species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are often referred to as \"tef grains.\" These grains are highly nutritious and are used as a staple food in Ethiopia. Poa tef is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in cool, temperate climates."
