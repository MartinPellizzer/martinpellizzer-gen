    "intro": "Ptilopteris triptera var. subpinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf cliff fern, characterized by its finely divided, subpinnate fronds. It typically grows in rocky, coastal or maritime environments, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps them withstand harsh coastal conditions. It is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies on cliffs and rocky outcrops. This fern is often found in temperate regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and along the western coasts of Canada."
