    "intro": "Prunus nana f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered dwarf cherry, is a compact shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and dark green, with a dense growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. Its fruits are small, red berries that ripen in late summer and are edible for both humans and wildlife. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold climates."
