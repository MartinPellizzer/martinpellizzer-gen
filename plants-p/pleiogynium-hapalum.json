    "intro": "Pleiogynium hapalum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters, and it produces woody fruits that contain several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
