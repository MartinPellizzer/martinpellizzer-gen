    "intro": "Platanthera stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
