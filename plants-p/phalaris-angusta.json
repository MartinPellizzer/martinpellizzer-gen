    "intro": "Phalaris angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Phalaris angusta is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
