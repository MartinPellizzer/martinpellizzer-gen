    "intro": "Poa stebbinsii, commonly known as Stebbins' bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in its native habitat. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with short, awned lemmas. Stebbins' bluegrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
