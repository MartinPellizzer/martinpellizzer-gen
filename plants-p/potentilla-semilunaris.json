    "intro": "Potentilla semilunaris, commonly known as the moonflower potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. The flowers emit a subtle scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
