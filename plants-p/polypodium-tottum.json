    "intro": "Polypodium tottum, commonly known as the Tottum wall fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiales order. The plant's rhizome is creeping and often covered with a layer of fine, hairy structures."
