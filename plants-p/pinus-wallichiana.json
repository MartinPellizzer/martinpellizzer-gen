    "intro": "Pinus wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan blue pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and dark blue-green foliage. The needles are typically arranged in bundles of five, and they are long, stiff, and have a distinctive blue-gray hue. The tree produces cones that are initially green but turn brown as they mature. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is well adapted to cold and harsh climatic conditions."
