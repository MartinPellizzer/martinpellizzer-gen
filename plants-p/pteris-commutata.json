    "intro": "Pteris commutata, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. Pteris commutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
