    "intro": "Pseudosasa vittata, commonly known as the bamboo fern, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to eastern Asia. It is a clump-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant has slender, arching stems that produce small, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its rhizomes are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Pseudosasa vittata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
