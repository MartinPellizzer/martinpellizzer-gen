    "intro": "Pieris ovalifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy Japanese pieris, is a variant of the Japanese pieris species. It is a deciduous shrub native to Japan, characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
