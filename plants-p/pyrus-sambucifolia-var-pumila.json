    "intro": "Pyrus sambucifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sycamore, is a compact variant of the sycamore tree native to China. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are similar in shape to those of the common sycamore but are typically smaller and more densely arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique appearance and medicinal value, it is a valued plant in both horticulture and phytotherapy."
