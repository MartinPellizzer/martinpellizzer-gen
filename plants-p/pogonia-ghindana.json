    "intro": "Pogonia ghindana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers and unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows on the trunks of trees, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often appearing in a rosette formation. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia ghindana is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
