    "intro": "Phebalium ellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hakea, is a shrub native to south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It has a woody stem and is part of the Proteaceae family, which includes many species with specialized adaptations for nutrient-poor environments. The flowers are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds, contributing to its ecological significance."
