    "intro": "Platystele peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian flat-stemmed orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and unique, flattened stems. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele peruviana is considered a vulnerable species."
