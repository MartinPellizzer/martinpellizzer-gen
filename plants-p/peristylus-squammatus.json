    "intro": "Peristylus squammatus, commonly known as the scaly peristylus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in small, scale-like structures, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Peristylus squammatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
