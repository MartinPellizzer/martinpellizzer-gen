    "intro": "Pyrus pyrifolia f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale-leaved Chinese pear, is a unique variant of the Chinese pear tree. It is characterized by its pale, almost white, foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical green leaves of the species. This form exhibits a more delicate appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant retains the typical fruiting habits of Pyrus pyrifolia, producing edible pears under suitable conditions. Its botanical interest lies in its distinct leaf coloration and its role in horticultural variation."
