    "intro": "Physalis somnifera, commonly known as the sleeping cherry or moonfruit, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant orange, lantern-shaped fruits that enclose the seeds. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is edible when fully ripe, though the skin is thick and often consumed after peeling."
