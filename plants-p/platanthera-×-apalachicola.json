    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 apalachicola, commonly known as the Apalachicola twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as cypress swamps and pine flatwoods. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
