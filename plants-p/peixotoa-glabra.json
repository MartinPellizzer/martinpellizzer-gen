    "intro": "Peixotoa glabra, commonly known as the smooth peixotoa, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its simple, smooth-stemmed structure and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
