    "intro": "Phaca tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's phaca, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, coastal environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are narrow and linear. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phaca tweedyi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
