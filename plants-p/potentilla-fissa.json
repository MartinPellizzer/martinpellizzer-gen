    "intro": "Potentilla fissa, commonly known as the crested cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its height ranges from 30 to 60 centimeters, and it is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Potentilla fissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
