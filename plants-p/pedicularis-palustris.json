    "intro": "Pedicularis palustris, commonly known as the marsh lousewort, is a flowering plant native to wet, boggy habitats in the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wet meadow environments."
