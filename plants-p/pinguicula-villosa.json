    "intro": "Pinguicula villosa, commonly known as the hairy butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or boggy areas. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with a distinctive spurred shape. Pinguicula villosa is a perennial species that relies on insect prey for essential nutrients due to its nutrient-poor habitat."
