    "intro": "Pyrus uipongensis, commonly known as the Uipongensis pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically the Yunnan province. The plant is characterized by its deciduous leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
