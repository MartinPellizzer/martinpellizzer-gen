    "intro": "Pharbitis cathartica, commonly known as redroot morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant produces cylindrical, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
