    "intro": "Polystichum craspedocarpium, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum craspedocarpium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, lush foliage."
