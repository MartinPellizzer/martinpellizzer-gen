    "intro": "Poa papuana var. pulviniformis, commonly known as the Papuan cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It forms dense, mat-like cushions that are well adapted to harsh alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its ecological importance in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
