    "intro": "Pinguicula chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem with showy, bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an intriguing subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
