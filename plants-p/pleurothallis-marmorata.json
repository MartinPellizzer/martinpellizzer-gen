    "intro": "Pleurothallis marmorata, commonly known as the marbled pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly patterned leaves that often display a marbled appearance. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
