    "intro": "Pennisetum angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of the United States. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are highly ornamental and attract birds and insects. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
