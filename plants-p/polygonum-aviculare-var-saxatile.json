    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. saxatile, commonly known as sand knotgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions. It thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry meadows. The plant has slender, ascending stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and appear in shades of pink or red. It is characterized by its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
