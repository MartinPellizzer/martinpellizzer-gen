    "intro": "Potentilla hirta var. pedatotaurica, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically palmately divided, with hairy surfaces that give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and long blooming period."
