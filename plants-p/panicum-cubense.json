    "intro": "Panicum cubense, commonly known as Cuban panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
