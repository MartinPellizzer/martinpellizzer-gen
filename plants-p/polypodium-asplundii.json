    "intro": "Polypodium asplundii, commonly known as the asplundii fern, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its compact growth habit and ornamental fronds make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
