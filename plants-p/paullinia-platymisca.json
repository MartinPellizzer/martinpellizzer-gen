It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, orange-red berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are clustered in panicles. The fruit is edible, though the seeds are often dispersed by birds and other animals."
