    "intro": "Paracolpodium altaicum, commonly known as the Alaska lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that grows in rocky, alpine, or tundra environments. The plant produces tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Paracolpodium altaicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment."
