    "intro": "Polypodium stenurum, commonly known as the narrow-veined wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks, and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
