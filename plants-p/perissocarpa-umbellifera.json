    "intro": "Perissocarpa umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrella fruit, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The fruit is perissocarp, meaning it has an uneven number of seeds, typically three, enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like structure. This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and taxonomy."
