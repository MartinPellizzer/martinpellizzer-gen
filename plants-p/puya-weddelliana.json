    "intro": "Puya weddelliana, commonly known as the Weddellian grass tree, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, forming a dense rosette structure. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh, cold environments make it a notable species in its ecological niche. Puya weddelliana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
