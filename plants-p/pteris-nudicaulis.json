    "intro": "Pteris nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris nudicaulis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
