    "intro": "Pinus mugo subsp. pseudopumilio, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches forming a dense, cushion-like shape. The leaves are needle-like, typically 1\u20132 cm long, and are arranged in spirals around the stems. The cones are small, woody, and usually less than 3 cm in length, containing two to three seeds. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
