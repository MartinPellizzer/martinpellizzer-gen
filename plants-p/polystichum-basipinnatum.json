    "intro": "Polystichum basipinnatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided, evergreen fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
