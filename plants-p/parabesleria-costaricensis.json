It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
