    "intro": "Piper infossibaccatum, commonly known as the deep-barked pepper vine, is a member of the Piperaceae family, native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, deeply furrowed bark and elongated, hanging stems that support its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that develop into peppery, three-lobed berries. Its foliage is typically glossy and dark green, with lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly aromatic scent. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its visual interest and potential medicinal properties."
