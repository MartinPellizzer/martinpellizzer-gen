    "intro": "Prosopis juliflora f. arborea, commonly known as the tree legume or mesquite, is a shrub or tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, and its small, yellowish flowers that appear in dense clusters. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in nutrients. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it is often used for erosion control and as a source of fodder for livestock."
