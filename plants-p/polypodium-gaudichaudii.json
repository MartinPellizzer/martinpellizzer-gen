    "intro": "Polypodium gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Gaudichaud's cliff fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, with fronds that are usually pinnately compound and covered in small, rounded teeth. Its spores are produced in sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
