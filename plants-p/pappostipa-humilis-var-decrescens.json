    "intro": "Pappostipa humilis var. decrescens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it valuable for ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
