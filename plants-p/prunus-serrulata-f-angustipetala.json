    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cherry, is a botanical variant of the Japanese cherry. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Prunus serrulata. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It is native to Japan and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
