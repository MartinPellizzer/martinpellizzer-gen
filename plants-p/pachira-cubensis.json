    "intro": "Pachira cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban money plant, is a flowering plant native to Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries containing seeds. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Pachira cubensis is also valued for its symbolic meaning, representing good fortune and prosperity."
