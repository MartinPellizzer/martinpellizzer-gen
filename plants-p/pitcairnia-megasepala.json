    "intro": "Pitcairnia megasepala, commonly known as the giant pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure that supports various epiphytic organisms. The plant produces showy, violet-colored inflorescences that bloom once in its lifetime, typically after several years of growth. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
