    "intro": "Phoberos mundii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Phoberos mundii is considered critically endangered and is highly protected."
