    "intro": "Pellaea wrightiana, commonly known as Wright's fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pellaea wrightiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
