    "intro": "Primula lateriflora, commonly known as the side-flowered primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters and features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive yellow throat. These flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand, and are borne on long, slender stems. Primula lateriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
