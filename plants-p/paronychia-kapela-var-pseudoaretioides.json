    "intro": "Paronychia kapela var. pseudoaretioides, commonly known as the Cape rose or false hibiscus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in a thin, waxy cuticle. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight bluish tint, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
