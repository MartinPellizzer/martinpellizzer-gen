    "intro": "Phaca prorifera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its blue or violet flowers, which are clustered in dense heads and surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Phaca prorifera is often found in maritime environments, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
