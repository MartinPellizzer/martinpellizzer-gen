    "intro": "Pandanus strigilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, which eventually develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and thatching, while the plant itself thrives in coastal and wetland environments. Pandanus strigilis is an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native habitats."
