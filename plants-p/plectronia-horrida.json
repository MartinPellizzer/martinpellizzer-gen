    "intro": "Plectronia horrida, commonly known as the rough plectronia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Plectronia horrida is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
