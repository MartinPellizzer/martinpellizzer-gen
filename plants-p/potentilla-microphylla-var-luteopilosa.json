    "intro": "Potentilla microphylla var. luteopilosa, commonly known as the golden-hair potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage remains green throughout the growing season, providing ornamental value in gardens. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
