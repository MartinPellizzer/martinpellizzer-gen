    "intro": "Pouteria anomala, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil. Its fruit is typically dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological importance in the rainforest ecosystem. The plant is also valued for its economic significance as a source of the highly nutritious Brazil nut."
