    "intro": "Pilosella hoppeana subsp. lydia, commonly known as Lydia's pearly everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky habitats or open grasslands. Pilosella hoppeana subsp. lydia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
