    "intro": "Paracaryum velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
