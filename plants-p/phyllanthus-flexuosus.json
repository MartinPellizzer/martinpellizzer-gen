    "intro": "Phyllanthus flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible woodbine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Phyllanthus flexuosus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
