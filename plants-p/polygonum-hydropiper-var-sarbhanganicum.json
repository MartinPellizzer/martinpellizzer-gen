    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper var. sarbhanganicum, commonly known as the Indian pepper plant or sarbhanga, is a variant of the water pepper species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its roots are rich in essential oils and have been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for their digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks."
