    "intro": "Pitcairnia angustifolia var. simplicior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that persist for several months. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the moist, shaded environments of its natural habitat."
