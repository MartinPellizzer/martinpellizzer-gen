It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are broad and toothed, giving it its common name. It produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. Psiadia grandidentata is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
