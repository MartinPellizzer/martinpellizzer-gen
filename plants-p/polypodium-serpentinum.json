    "intro": "Polypodium serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome with fronds that are usually leathery and divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, particularly those rich in serpentine rock, which is why it is often found in rocky, mountainous areas. Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it an important indicator species for serpentine habitats."
