    "intro": "Pedicularis tapaoensis, commonly known as the Tapao's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This plant is characterized by its tubular, often brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Pedicularis tapaoensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments, growing in forest understories or along stream banks."
