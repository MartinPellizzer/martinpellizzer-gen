    "intro": "Poa sibirica var. lenensis, commonly known as Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of the vegetation in high-altitude and tundra ecosystems."
