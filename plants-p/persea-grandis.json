    "intro": "Persea grandis, commonly known as the Mexican avocado or bigleaf avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, dark green, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree bears fruit that is similar in appearance to the common avocado but is less widely cultivated. The fruit contains a single large seed and is valued for its nutritional content. Persea grandis thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
