    "intro": "Palicourea ternata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or purpleleaf palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green with a slight pubescence. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal umbels, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically dark blue or black when mature. Palicourea ternata is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
