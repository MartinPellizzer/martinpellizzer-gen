    "intro": "Panicum furtivum, commonly known as the sneaking panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Panicum furtivum is often considered a weed but plays a role in ecological succession and soil health."
