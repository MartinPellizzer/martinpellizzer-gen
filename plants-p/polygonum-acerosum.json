    "intro": "Polygonum acerosum, commonly known as the scarlet polygonum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive bracteate inflorescences and rhombic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its showy, pink to red flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Polygonum acerosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
