    "intro": "Polystichum sublanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-lance fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
