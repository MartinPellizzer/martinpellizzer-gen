    "intro": "Pothos hookeri, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a variegated pattern of yellow or white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in low-light conditions and is highly tolerant of neglect, making it a popular houseplant. Its rapid growth and ease of care contribute to its widespread cultivation."
