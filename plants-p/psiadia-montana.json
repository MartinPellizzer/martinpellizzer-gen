    "intro": "Psiadia montana, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America and parts of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring. Psiadia montana is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in traditional medicine."
