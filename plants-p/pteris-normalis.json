    "intro": "Pteris normalis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in spreading the plant across the substrate. Pteris normalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
