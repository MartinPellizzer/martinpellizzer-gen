    "intro": "Padus oxypyrena, commonly known as the European whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, hard fruits called drupes, which are typically red or yellow when mature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
