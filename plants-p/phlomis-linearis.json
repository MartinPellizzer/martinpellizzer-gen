It features tall, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, velvety leaves that are linear in shape. The plant produces showy clusters of yellow flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
