It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
