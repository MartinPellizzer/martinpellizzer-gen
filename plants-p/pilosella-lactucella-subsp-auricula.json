It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
