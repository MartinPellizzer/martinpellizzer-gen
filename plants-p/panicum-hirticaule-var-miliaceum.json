    "intro": "Panicum hirticaule var. miliaceum, commonly known as proso millet, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, erect leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are harvested for their nutritional value. Proso millet is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy crop. It is also valued for its rapid growth and high yield, contributing to both food security and ecological restoration efforts."
