    "intro": "Prunus capricida, commonly known as the capricorn cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, round, red berries that are edible but often sour. Prunus capricida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
