    "intro": "Prescottia pteristyloides, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are showy, with pale yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
