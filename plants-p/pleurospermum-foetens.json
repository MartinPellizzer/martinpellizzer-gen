It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats. Its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, particularly when the leaves are crushed."
