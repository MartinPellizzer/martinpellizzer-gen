    "intro": "Pouteria dussiana, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree is notable for its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell and are commercially valuable as Brazil nuts. It thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and requires a warm, stable climate. Pouteria dussiana plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
