It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other members of the species."
