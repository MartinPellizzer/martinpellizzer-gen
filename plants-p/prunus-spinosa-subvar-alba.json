    "intro": "Prunus spinosa subvar. alba, commonly known as the white sloe, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces dark purple berries that ripen in late summer, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The white sloe is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils."
