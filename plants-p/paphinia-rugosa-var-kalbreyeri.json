    "intro": "Paphinia rugosa var. kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's paphiopedilum, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces intricate, lip-shaped petals that are often adorned with contrasting markings. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
