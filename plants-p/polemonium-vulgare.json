    "intro": "Polemonium vulgare, commonly known as bluebead lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
