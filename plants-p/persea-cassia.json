    "intro": "Persea cassia, commonly known as the yellow sycamore, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Persea cassia is also valued for its timber, which is durable and used in furniture making."
