    "intro": "Puccinellia harcusiana, commonly known as the Harcus' saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable component of desert ecosystems. Puccinellia harcusiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
