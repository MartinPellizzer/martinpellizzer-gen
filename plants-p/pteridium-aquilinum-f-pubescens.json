    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent bracken, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and spore-producing structures. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features serrated, triangular fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its \"pubescent\" designation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy and ecological role."
