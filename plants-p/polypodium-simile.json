    "intro": "Polypodium simile, commonly known as the common water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fronds that are usually pinnately compound, featuring a broad, deltoid shape. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia found on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium simile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green foliage."
