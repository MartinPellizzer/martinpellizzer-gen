    "intro": "Phyllanthus lucidus, commonly known as the shining gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, with dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red or orange berries that are edible. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
