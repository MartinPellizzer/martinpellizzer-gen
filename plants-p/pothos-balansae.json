It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that range from light green to silver in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Pothos balansae is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
