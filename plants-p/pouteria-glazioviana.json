    "intro": "Pouteria glazioviana, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed trunk that helps it thrive in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a keystone species, supporting a wide range of wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of the Amazon."
