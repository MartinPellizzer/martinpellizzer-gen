    "intro": "Puya weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes mountains of South America. This perennial plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous bright red or orange flowers, which are typically tubular in shape. The leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, sunny environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Puya weberbaueri is also noted for its ability to produce offsets, allowing it to propagate vegetatively in its natural setting."
