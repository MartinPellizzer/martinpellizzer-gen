    "intro": "Pimpinella rigidula, commonly known as rigid shield-pod, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Pimpinella rigidula is generally considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
