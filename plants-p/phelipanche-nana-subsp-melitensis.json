    "intro": "Phelipanche nana subsp. melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese common toadflax, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean climates, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, and its roots are known to emit volatile organic compounds that can inhibit the growth of neighboring plants. This subspecies is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats across southern Europe."
