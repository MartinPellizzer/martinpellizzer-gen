    "intro": "Porana mairei, commonly known as the Maire's porana, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Porana mairei is often found in forest margins and rocky areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates."
