    "intro": "Peperomia tenerrima, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, velvety foliage with dark green, waxy leaves that are often marked with silver or white veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia tenerrima is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
