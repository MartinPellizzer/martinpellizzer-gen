    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. malyana, commonly known as the Malyana cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a ribbed, spiny stem that can range from green to reddish in color, depending on light exposure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warm season, typically in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its small, spherical shape and unique spination make it a distinctive addition to succulent collections."
