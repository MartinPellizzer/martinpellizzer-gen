It features wiry stems and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental flowers and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
