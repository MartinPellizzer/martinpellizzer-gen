    "intro": "Polypodium montigenum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually pinnately divided and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Polypodium montigenum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
