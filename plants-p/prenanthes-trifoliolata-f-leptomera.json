    "intro": "Prenanthes trifoliolata f. leptomera, commonly known as the slender-leaf water hemp, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in wetlands and disturbed soils, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are narrow and elongated, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is notable for its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form, which may be an adaptation to its specific habitat."
