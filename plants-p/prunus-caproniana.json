    "intro": "Prunus caproniana, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or capronia cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and features slender, branching stems with opposite, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, edible drupes. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Prunus caproniana is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
