    "intro": "Phaca oroboides, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or humus-rich soils. Phaca oroboides is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
