    "intro": "Pentas parviflora, commonly known as the small-flower pentas, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. The plant has a compact growth habit with glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pentas parviflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
