    "intro": "Piccia, commonly known as the common lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in a variety of environments, from moist woodlands to rocky surfaces, depending on the specific species. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the fungal and algal components. Piccia plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an indicator species for environmental health."
