    "intro": "Piper alveolatifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with small, rounded lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
