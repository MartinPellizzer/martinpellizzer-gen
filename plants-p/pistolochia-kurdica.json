    "intro": "Pistolochia kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and alternate, simple leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is native to regions of the Middle East, including parts of Turkey and Iran, and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
