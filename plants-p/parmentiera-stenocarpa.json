    "intro": "Parmentiera stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited parmentiera, is a woody shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that are typically green when mature, containing several seeds. Parmentiera stenocarpa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
