    "intro": "Prescottia tepuyensis, commonly known as the tepuy pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive pattern on the petals. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the tepui plateaus. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
