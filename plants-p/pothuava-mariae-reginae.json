    "intro": "Pothuava mariae-reginae, commonly known as the royal pothuava, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf known as a spathe. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
