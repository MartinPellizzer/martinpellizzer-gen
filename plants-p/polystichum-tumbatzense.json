    "intro": "Polystichum tumbatzense, commonly known as the Tumbaz\u00e9 fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Polystichum tumbatzense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
