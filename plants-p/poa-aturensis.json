    "intro": "Poa aturensis, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, blue-green flowers. Poa aturensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
