    "intro": "Palmerella debilis subsp. debilis, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its structure and flowering pattern make it an important species for pollinators in its native habitat."
