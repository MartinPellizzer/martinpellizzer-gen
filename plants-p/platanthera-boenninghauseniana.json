    "intro": "Platanthera boenninghauseniana, commonly known as the Boenninghausen's lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a tall, spike-like inflorescence bearing numerous small, white to pale green flowers. Native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often visited by flies and bees, making it an important species for pollination networks in its habitat."
