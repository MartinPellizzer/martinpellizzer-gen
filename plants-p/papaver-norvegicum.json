    "intro": "Papaver norvegicum, commonly known as the Norwegian poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Scandinavia. It features striking, bright red flowers with a prominent black center, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It grows up to 1 meter tall and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
