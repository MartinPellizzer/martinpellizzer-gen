    "intro": "Panicum ramulosum var. viride, commonly known as green panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop in warmer climates."
