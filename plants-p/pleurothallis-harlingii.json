    "intro": "Pleurothallis harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively obscure in the horticultural trade."
