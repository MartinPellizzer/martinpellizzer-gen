    "intro": "Prosthechea pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature bromeliad, is a small epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are often hidden within the leaf rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
