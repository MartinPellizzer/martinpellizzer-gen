It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet, and slightly tart fruits. The fruit has a smooth, thin skin and a crisp, juicy flesh. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a fruit-bearing plant in temperate climates."
