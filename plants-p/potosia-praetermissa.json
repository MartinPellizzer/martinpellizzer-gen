    "intro": "Potosia praetermissa, commonly known as the neglected potosia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or wetlands. It has a short, woody stem with a fibrous root system, and its flowers are often clustered in panicles. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, Potosia praetermissa is considered a species of conservation concern."
