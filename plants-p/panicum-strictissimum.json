    "intro": "Panicum strictissimum, commonly known as rigid panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has tall, stiff stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
