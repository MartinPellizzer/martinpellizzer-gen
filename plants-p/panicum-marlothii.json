    "intro": "Panicum marlothii, commonly known as Marloth's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
