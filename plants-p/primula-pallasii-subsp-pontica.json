It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant typically blooms in spring and is adapted to moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to other Primula species."
