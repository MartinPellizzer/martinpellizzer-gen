    "intro": "Physocarpus riparius, commonly known as the silver-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a silvery-white underside that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
