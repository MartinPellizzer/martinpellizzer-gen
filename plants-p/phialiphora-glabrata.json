    "intro": "Phialiphora glabrata, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, rootless structure and its ability to grow in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically transparent and can be found in clusters along the stems. Phialiphora glabrata is often found in nutrient-rich habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands."
