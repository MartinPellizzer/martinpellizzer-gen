    "intro": "Pachypodium mikea, commonly known as the Mikea bottle tree, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has sparse, often spiny foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers during the dry season. Its unique morphology makes it well adapted to the extreme conditions of its native habitat. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes other succulent plants with similar water-storing features."
