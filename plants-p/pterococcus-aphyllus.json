    "intro": "Pterococcus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless legume, is a woody shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing compressed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest in botanical studies and has limited uses in traditional medicine."
