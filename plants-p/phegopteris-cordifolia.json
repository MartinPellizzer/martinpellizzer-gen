    "intro": "Phegopteris cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are often described as having a heart-shaped appearance, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Phegopteris cordifolia plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats."
