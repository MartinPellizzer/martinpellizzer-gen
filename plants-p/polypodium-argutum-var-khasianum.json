    "intro": "Polypodium argutum var. khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi holly fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal."
