    "intro": "Polypodium cinereum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant has a rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand dry conditions. Polypodium cinereum is often found in shaded, humid habitats and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
