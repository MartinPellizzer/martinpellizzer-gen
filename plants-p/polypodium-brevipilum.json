    "intro": "Polypodium brevipilum, commonly known as the short-stalked water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
