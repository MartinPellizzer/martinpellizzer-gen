    "intro": "Polypodium melanoloma, commonly known as the black-stemmed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark, wiry rhizomes and leathery, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of its fertile fronds. Polypodium melanoloma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
