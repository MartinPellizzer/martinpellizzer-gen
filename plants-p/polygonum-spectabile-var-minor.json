    "intro": "Polygonum spectabile var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf flame flower, is a compact perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features striking red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves, giving it its showy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, adding to its ornamental appeal."
