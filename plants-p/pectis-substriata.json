    "intro": "Pectis substriata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive white or pale green underside, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Pectis substriata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
