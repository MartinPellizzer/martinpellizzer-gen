    "intro": "Phegopteris bivestita, commonly known as the two-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
