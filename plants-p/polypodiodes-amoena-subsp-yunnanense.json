    "intro": "Polypodiodes amoena subsp. yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan lady's-tongue, is a fern native to China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
