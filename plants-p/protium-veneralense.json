    "intro": "Protium veneralense, commonly known as the Venerable Protium, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a single, smooth-seed kernel. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of tropical rainforest ecosystems and its potential for medicinal use."
