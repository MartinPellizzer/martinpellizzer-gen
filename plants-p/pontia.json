    "intro": "Pontia, commonly known as the cabbage butterfly or mustard weed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, cruciform flowers and are often found in temperate regions. They typically have alternate, simple leaves that are often hairy or pubescent. Pontia species are known for their ability to thrive in disturbed soils and are often considered weeds. Some species are host plants for the cabbage white butterfly, which lays its eggs on their leaves."
