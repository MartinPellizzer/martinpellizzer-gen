    "intro": "Populus tremuloides var. cercidiphylla, commonly known as quaking aspen, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its trembling leaves, which flutter in the wind due to the flexible petioles. The plant has a shallow root system and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is known for its ability to form large, genetically uniform stands through vegetative propagation."
