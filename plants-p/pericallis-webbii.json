    "intro": "Pericallis webbii, commonly known as the Webb's wax plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking floral display during the spring and summer months."
