It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers. The plant is notable for its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"lanata,\" meaning \"woolly.\" Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer.
