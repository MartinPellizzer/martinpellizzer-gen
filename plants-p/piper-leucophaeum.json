    "intro": "Piper leucophaeum, commonly known as the white-leaved pepper, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tiny, round berries that turn red when mature. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
