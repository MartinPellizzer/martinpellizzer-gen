    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. hispidum, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stalks that often turn bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow to brown in color. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed sites. Its coarse texture and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
