    "intro": "Poa altaica, commonly known as the Altai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa altaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
