It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The plant features upright stems that are often reddish in color, especially near the base, and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink to red, appearing in late summer to early fall. Polygonum cognatum is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
