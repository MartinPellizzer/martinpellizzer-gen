    "intro": "Polypodium caripense, commonly known as the Caripense fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are lanceolate in shape. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique characteristic that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
