    "intro": "Pandanus labyrinthicus var. spinosissimus, commonly known as the spiny pandanus, is a species native to the Pacific Islands. It is a tall, herbaceous plant characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in spines. The plant produces large, branched inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet, coastal environments. The spiny leaves provide structural support and may also serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
