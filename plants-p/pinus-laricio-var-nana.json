    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Swiss stone pine, is a compact, low-growing variant of the Swiss stone pine. It is native to the Alps and Pyrenees, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features dense, short needles and produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to form a rounded, shrub-like form. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
