    "intro": "Polystichum oblongum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern or the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features dark green, leathery, and lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Polystichum oblongum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
