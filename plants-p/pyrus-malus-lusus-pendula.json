    "intro": "Pyrus malus lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping apple tree, is a cultivar of the apple tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. This ornamental tree features a unique, drooping growth habit that gives it a graceful, almost ethereal appearance. The leaves are typically dark green and oval-shaped, while the flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in spring. The fruit is smaller than standard apples and often has a tart flavor, though it is primarily grown for its aesthetic value rather than for consumption. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
