    "intro": "Panicum piligerum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically reddish in color, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in landscapes and erosion control. Its drought tolerance and ability to form a dense mat make it a versatile choice for both ornamental and functional applications."
