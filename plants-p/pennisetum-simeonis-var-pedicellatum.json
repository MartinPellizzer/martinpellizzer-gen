    "intro": "Pennisetum simeonis var. pedicellatum, commonly known as the purple fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of feathery, purple-pink inflorescences, which add a vibrant touch to gardens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally bluish-green in color, providing a nice contrast to its showy flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and water-wise gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract birds and other wildlife."
