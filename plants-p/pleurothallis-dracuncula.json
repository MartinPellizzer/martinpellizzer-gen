It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
