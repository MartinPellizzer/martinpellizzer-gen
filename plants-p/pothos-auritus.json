    "intro": "Pothos auritus, commonly known as the \"earleaf philodendron,\" is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that have a distinctive ear-like protrusion on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its blooms. Its trailing growth habit makes it popular as a houseplant, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Pothos auritus is relatively low maintenance, requiring moderate watering and well-draining soil."
