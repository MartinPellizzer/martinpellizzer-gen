    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 shintenense, commonly known as the Shintenese polypody, is a hybrid fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops, and is often found growing on tree trunks or soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
