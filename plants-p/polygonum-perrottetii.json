    "intro": "Polygonum perrottetii, commonly known as the Perrottetii knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes species known for their distinctive leaf shapes and flowering structures. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with prominent venation, and it produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
