    "intro": "Polanisia felina, commonly known as the cat's paw plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble the shape of a cat's paw, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to cats. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Polanisia felina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and pleasant scent."
