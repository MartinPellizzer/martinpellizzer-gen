    "intro": "Puccinellia transsilvanica var. pseudomaritima, commonly known as the coastal puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to saline and coastal environments. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or along shorelines. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, salty conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
