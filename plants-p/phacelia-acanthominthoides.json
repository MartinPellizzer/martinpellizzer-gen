    "intro": "Phacelia acanthominthoides, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spikelike inflorescences, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Phacelia acanthominthoides is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
