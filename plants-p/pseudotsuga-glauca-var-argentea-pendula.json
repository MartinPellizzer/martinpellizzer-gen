The plant is native to specific regions in the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage remains evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in gardens or natural landscapes. Due to its rarity and unique characteristics, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in specialized horticultural settings."
