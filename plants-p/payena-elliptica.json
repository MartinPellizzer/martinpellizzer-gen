It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.
