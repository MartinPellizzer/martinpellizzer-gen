It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common sight in riparian habitats and a potential indicator of wetland health."
