It features dark green, velvety leaves with a slightly waxy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
