It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, sword-shaped leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces striking inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, with numerous small, clustered flowers. Its fibrous leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. Pandanus lictor thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils."
