It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces large, woody fruits that contain a single, nutrient-rich seed, which is the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in humid, well-drained soils. It plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
