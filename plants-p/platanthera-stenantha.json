    "intro": "Platanthera stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It lacks true leaves and instead has modified leaves called phyllodes that perform photosynthesis. Platanthera stenantha is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil."
