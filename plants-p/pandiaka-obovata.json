It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
