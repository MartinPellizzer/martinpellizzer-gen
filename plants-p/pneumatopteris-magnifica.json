    "intro": "Pneumatopteris magnifica, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features feathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, making it one of the largest fern species. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its leaves are typically submerged, with some floating on the water surface, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its propagation in wetland habitats."
