    "intro": "Pitcairnia johannis, commonly known as the royal pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking rosette of broad, dark green leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in a tight, spiky inflorescence, often reaching several feet in height. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia johannis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
