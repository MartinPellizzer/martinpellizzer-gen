It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and lance-shaped, leathery leaves that have a distinctive silvery-white underside. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Palicourea flagellifera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
