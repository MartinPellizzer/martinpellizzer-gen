    "intro": "Polypodium bolivarii, commonly known as the Bolivian shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Polypodium bolivarii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
