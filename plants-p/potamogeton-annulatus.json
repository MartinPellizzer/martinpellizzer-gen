It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its roots help stabilize sediments, contributing to water clarity. Potamogeton annulatus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
