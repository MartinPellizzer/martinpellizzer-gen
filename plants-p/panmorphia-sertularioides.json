    "intro": "Panmorphia sertularioides, commonly known as the coral-like sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the order Hexacorallia. It is characterized by its soft, flexible body and a central column surrounded by tentacles used for capturing prey. The plant, more accurately a cnidarian, thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found in coral reefs. Its structure resembles that of a sertulariid, with a colonial growth pattern and a symbiotic relationship with algae. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for reef health."
