    "intro": "Pseudoliparis undulata, commonly known as the undulating sea whip, is a species of soft coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Anthophyceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and translucent, undulating polyps. The plant thrives in shallow, warm waters with good water flow, often forming dense colonies on coral reefs. Its coloration can vary from pale pink to reddish-brown, depending on the presence of symbiotic algae. Pseudoliparis undulata plays a vital role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine organisms."
