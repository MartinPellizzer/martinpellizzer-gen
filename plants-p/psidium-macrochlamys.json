    "intro": "Psidium macrochlamys, commonly known as the large-flowered guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, citrus-scented fruits. The fruit is typically small to medium in size, with a thick, leathery skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses in local cuisines."
