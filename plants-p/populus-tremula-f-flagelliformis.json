    "intro": "Populus tremula f. flagelliformis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a variant of the European aspen characterized by its distinctive drooping branches. This plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. It is also known for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize riverbanks, making it ecologically significant."
