    "intro": "Pleioblastus chino f. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming plant native to East Asia. It features slender, upright culms that are typically no more than 1 to 2 meters in height, making it ideal for small spaces or rock gardens. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are bright green and often have a slightly glossy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by pale green to white seed pods. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions with moderate moisture."
