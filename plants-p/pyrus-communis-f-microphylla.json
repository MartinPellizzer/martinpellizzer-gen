    "intro": "Pyrus communis f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf common pear, is a compact variant of the common pear tree. It features smaller leaves and reduced fruit size compared to the standard Pyrus communis. The plant exhibits a rounded growth habit with dense foliage, making it suitable for ornamental purposes. It typically blooms with white flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are smaller and less sweet than those of the typical pear. This form is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
