    "intro": "Phlomoides uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower phlomoides, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that often grow up to 2 feet tall, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to lavender flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for native gardens. Its delicate appearance and native status make it an attractive addition to ecological landscaping."
