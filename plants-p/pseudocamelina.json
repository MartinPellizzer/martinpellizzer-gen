    "intro": "Pseudocamelina, commonly known as the false flax, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It consists of several species that are native to North America, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. These plants are characterized by their annual life cycle, hairy stems, and small, yellow flowers that often cluster in racemes. The leaves are typically alternate and linear, with a rough texture. Pseudocamelina species are often found in disturbed soils and are adapted to thrive in dry conditions."
