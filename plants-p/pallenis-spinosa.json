It features a compact, bushy growth habit with multiple stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, textured surface. Pallenis spinosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
