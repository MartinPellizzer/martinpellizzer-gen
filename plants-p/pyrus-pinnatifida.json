    "intro": "Pyrus pinnatifida, commonly known as the Japanese nashi or Chinese white pear, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive serrated edge. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruit that matures to a pale yellow or golden color. The fruit has a crisp, sweet flesh with a mild aroma and is often used in both culinary and medicinal applications. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental and fruit-bearing plant in temperate climates."
