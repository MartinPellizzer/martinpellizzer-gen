It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces showy, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer, making it a popular choice for native gardens.
