    "intro": "Pattersonia caroliniensis, commonly known as the Carolina lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, recurved shape. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
