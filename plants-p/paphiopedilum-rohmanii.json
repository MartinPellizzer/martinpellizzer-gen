    "intro": "Paphiopedilum rohmanii, commonly known as the Rohman's lady's slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a distinctive feature among orchids. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, with dark green, leathery leaves and a compact, upright growth habit. It produces striking flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a contrasting lip. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
