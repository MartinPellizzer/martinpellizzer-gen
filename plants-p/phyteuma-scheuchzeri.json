    "intro": "Phyteuma scheuchzeri, commonly known as the alpine phyteuma, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
