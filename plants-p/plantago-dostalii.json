    "intro": "Plantago dostalii, commonly known as the Dostal's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
