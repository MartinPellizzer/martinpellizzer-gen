    "intro": "Pinus vangeertii, commonly known as the Vangeertii pine, is a rare and little-known species of conifer native to a very limited geographic range in Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a semi-arid climate. Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, it is considered a vulnerable species."
