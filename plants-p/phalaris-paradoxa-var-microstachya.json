    "intro": "Phalaris paradoxa var. microstachya, commonly known as the dwarf false panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or reddish in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
