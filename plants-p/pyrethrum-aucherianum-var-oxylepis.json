    "intro": "Pyrethrum aucherianum var. oxylepis, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with bright yellow petals and a central disk of dark brown to black florets. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which are responsible for its insecticidal properties. These trichomes contain pyrethrins, natural compounds used in organic pest control. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental and commercial cultivation."
