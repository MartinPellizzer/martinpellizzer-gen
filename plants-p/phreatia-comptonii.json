    "intro": "Phreatia comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Phreatia comptonii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and orchid enthusiasts."
