    "intro": "Phalaroides, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. They are characterized by their yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The leaves are usually linear or lance-shaped, and the plant often grows in dense clusters. Phalaroides species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
