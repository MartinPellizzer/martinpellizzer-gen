    "intro": "Polypodium sanctae-rosae, commonly known as the sacred rose fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
