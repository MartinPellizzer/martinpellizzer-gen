    "intro": "Panicum sabulorum, commonly known as sand panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments and along shorelines. The plant produces tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
