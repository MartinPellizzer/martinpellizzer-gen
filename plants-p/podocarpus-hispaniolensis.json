    "intro": "Podocarpus hispaniolensis, commonly known as the Hispaniolan podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and conical shape. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
