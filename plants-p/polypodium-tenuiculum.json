    "intro": "Polypodium tenuiculum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
