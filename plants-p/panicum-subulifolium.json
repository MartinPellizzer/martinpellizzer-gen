    "intro": "Panicum subulifolium, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky, silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. The inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to reddish flowers."
