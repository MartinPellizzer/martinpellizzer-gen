    "intro": "Pellaea hastata var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that often have a bluish-gray waxy coating. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in horticultural settings."
