    "intro": "Pedicularis elata, commonly known as the tall yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also photosynthesizing. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
