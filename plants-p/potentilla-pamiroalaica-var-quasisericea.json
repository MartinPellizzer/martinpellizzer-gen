    "intro": "Potentilla pamiroalaica var. quasisericea, commonly known as the Pamir cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
