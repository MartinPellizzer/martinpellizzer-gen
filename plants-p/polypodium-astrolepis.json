    "intro": "Polypodium astrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to moist substrates. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a distinctive and ornamental species."
