    "intro": "Passiflora foetida var. muralis, commonly known as the wall passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a red or orange center, and they emit a faint, sometimes unpleasant odor. This species is often found growing on walls, rocks, or trees in humid environments. Its fruits are small, green berries that turn red when ripe and are edible but not particularly flavorful."
