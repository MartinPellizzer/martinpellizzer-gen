    "intro": "Peperomia ponthieui var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are small and oval-shaped, often with a slight waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically white or pale green, which appear at the base of the leaves. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and minimal water needs. Its dense foliage and compact growth make it an attractive addition to tabletop gardens and shaded indoor spaces."
