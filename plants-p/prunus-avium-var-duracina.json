    "intro": "Prunus avium var. duracina, commonly known as the duracina cherry, is a variety of the sweet cherry tree characterized by its compact growth habit and early fruiting. It produces small, dark red to black cherries with a firm, juicy flesh and a sweet, slightly tart flavor. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and orchards. Due to its hardiness, it is suitable for regions with mild winters and is relatively resistant to common cherry diseases."
