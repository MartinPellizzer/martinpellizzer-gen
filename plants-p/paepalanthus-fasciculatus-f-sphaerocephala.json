It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with clustered, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in high-altitude, humid environments and is adapted to rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
