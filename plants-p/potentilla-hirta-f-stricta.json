    "intro": "Potentilla hirta f. stricta, commonly known as the erect potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, upright growth with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in cold, rocky soils and harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in alpine gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand extreme climates."
