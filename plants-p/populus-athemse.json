    "intro": "Populus athemse, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open landscapes. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Populus athemse is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
