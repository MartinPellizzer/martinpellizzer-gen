    "intro": "Physalis pringlei, commonly known as the silverleaf groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules. The plant produces small, edible berries enclosed within a papery husk, similar to other members of the Physalis genus. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in arid regions."
