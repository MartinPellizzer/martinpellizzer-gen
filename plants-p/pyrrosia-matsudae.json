    "intro": "Pyrrosia matsudae, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically shield-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan, where it grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of rhizome scales, which contribute to its unique appearance. Pyrrosia matsudae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
