    "intro": "Physaria ovalifolia var. alba, commonly known as the white bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white, inflated pods that resemble bladders. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. This species is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
