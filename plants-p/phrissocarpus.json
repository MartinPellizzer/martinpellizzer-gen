It is characterized by its silver-gray, velvety leaves that reflect light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Phrissocarpus is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
