    "intro": "Polygonum glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants commonly referred to as smartweeds or knotweeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in dense clusters during the summer months, and it produces small, dry berries that are dispersed by wind. Polygonum glaberrimum is often found in moist soils along stream banks, wetlands, and disturbed areas."
