    "intro": "Psittacanthus semiarticulatus, commonly known as the articulated fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the substrate. Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of anchoring the plant in place while absorbing nutrients from the water. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens and ponds."
