    "intro": "Phegopteris heteroclita, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to the substrate, and its fronds are typically divided into a series of pinnae with a distinctive shape. It reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
