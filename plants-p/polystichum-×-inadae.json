    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 inadae, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum hirtum. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. It produces spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are released during the late spring and summer months. Polystichum \u00d7 inadae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
