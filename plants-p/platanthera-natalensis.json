    "intro": "Platanthera natalensis, commonly known as Natal twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has a short rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
