    "intro": "Polypodium ensifrons, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically elongated and rigid. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. Polypodium ensifrons thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
