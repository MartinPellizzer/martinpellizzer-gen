    "intro": "Pyrostria obovata, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces striking, showy flowers in shades of purple and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in open woodland or savanna environments. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
