    "intro": "Platanthera pugionifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs or along the edges of water bodies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
