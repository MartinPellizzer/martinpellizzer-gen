    "intro": "Pharnaceum spergula, commonly known as the lesser burrweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, releasing tiny seeds. Pharnaceum spergula is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
