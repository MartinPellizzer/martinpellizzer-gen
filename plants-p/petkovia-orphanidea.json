    "intro": "Petkovia orphanidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and its unique, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil to survive. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its value in botanical research and conservation efforts."
