    "intro": "Plectranthus psammophilus, commonly known as the sand-loving plectranthus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in dry climates."
