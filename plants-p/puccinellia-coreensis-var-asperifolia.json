    "intro": "Puccinellia coreensis var. asperifolia, commonly known as roughleaf core grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its robust, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are rough to the touch due to their dense, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and saline environments, making it an important species for stabilizing coastal and marsh ecosystems. Its adaptability to harsh conditions contributes to its ecological significance in its native range."
