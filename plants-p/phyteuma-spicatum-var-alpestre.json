    "intro": "Phyteuma spicatum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its foliage consists of linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
