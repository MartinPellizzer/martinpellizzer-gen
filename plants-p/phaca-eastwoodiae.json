    "intro": "Phaca eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's phaca, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. Native to specific regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Phaca eastwoodiae is considered endangered in its native range."
