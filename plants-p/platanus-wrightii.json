    "intro": "Platanus wrightii, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that grow in a dense, umbrella-like crown. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its trunk is typically smooth and gray, with a tendency to develop a buttressed base. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
