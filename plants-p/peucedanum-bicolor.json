    "intro": "Peucedanum bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored angelica, is a biennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick, fleshy, and aromatic, containing compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
