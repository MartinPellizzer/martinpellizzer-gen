It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. They produce umbellate or cyme-like inflorescences with small, greenish or reddish flowers. Proselia species are generally herbaceous perennials that thrive in moist, shaded environments."
