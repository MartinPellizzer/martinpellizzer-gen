    "intro": "Parmena menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' parmenia, is a flowering plant native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, white to cream-colored flowers appear in spring and are followed by small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Parmena menziesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
