    "intro": "Palmorchis chocoensis, commonly known as the Choc\u00f3 orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in the humid, shaded understory of the forest. Its botanical features include a pseudobulb structure and showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
