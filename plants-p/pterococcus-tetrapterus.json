    "intro": "Pterococcus tetrapterus, commonly known as the African inkberry, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are arranged in whorls of four. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance. The tree is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of dye."
