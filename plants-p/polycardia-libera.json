    "intro": "Polycardia libera, commonly known as the wandering heart plant, is a rare flowering species native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Polycardia libera is now classified as an endangered species."
