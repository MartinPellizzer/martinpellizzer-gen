    "intro": "Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian pine, is a tropical conifer native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically grouped in bundles of two. The tree produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, a common reproductive strategy in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest ecosystems. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
