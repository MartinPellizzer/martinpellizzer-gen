    "intro": "Phegopteris rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cliff brake, is a fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh, rocky habitats while maintaining a distinctive, elegant appearance."
