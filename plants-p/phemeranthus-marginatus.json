    "intro": "Phemeranthus marginatus, commonly known as the fleeting flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short-lived blooms, which open only for a brief period before wilting. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive margin that is often wavy or toothed. The flowers are small and clustered, often with a pale or white coloration, and are pollinated by insects."
