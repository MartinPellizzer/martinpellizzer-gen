    "intro": "Polygonum parviflorum, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pink to white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Polygonum parviflorum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in woodland areas."
