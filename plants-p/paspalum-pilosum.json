    "intro": "Paspalum pilosum, commonly known as hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along waterways, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Paspalum pilosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
