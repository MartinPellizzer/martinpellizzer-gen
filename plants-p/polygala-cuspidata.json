    "intro": "Polygala cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a perennial shrub or subshrub with slender, often branched stems and small, usually green or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of drought-tolerant flora."
