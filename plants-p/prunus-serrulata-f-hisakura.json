It is characterized by its profuse display of pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, creating a striking visual effect. The tree has a slender, upright growth habit with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It is native to Japan and is widely cultivated in temperate regions for its ornamental value. The species is also notable for its role in cultural symbolism, particularly in Japan, where it is associated with the changing seasons and the fleeting nature of beauty."
