    "intro": "Pteris similis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in moist environments, such as ponds, streams, and marshes, and is often used in aquatic gardens. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while supporting the growth of its fronds. Pteris similis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
