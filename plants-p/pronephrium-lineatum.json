    "intro": "Pronephrium lineatum, commonly known as the lined bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually whorled and can be finely divided, contributing to its intricate appearance. Pronephrium lineatum is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through captured prey."
