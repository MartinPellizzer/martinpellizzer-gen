    "intro": "Pyrus lasiopetala, commonly known as the woolly apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that give it its common name, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible apples that are typically small and tart, often used in local cuisines. Pyrus lasiopetala thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
