    "intro": "Puya textoragicolae, commonly known as the Andean torch cactus, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height, covered in dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences of yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It is adapted to extreme conditions, thriving in cold, arid environments with minimal rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
