    "intro": "Polypodium repens var. abruptum, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, and they often have a glossy surface. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its abrupt, sudden changes in frond morphology, giving it its specific epithet."
