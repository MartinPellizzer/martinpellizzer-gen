    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis alabastra, commonly known as the white-lipped pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
