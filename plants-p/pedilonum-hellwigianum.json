    "intro": "Pedilonum hellwigianum, commonly known as the Hellwig's slipper orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a trap for pollinators, particularly certain species of bees. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pedilonum hellwigianum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
