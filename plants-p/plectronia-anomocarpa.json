    "intro": "Plectronia anomocarpa, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with hairy, ribbed stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pink or red, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Plectronia anomocarpa is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
