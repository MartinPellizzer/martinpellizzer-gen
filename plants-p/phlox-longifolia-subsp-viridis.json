    "intro": "Phlox longifolia subsp. viridis, commonly known as the greenleaf phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually a bright green color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blossoms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
