    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga subsp. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
