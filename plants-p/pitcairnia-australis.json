    "intro": "Pitcairnia australis, commonly known as the southern pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that are typically pink or red, adding ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
