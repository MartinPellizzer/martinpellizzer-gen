    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum var. parviflorum, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to wetland environments. It features dense, tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in clusters, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and garden landscapes."
