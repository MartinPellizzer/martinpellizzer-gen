    "intro": "Phyllogeiton discolor, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, white-veined leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, adding a subtle yet elegant presence to the flora of its native range."
