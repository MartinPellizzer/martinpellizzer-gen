    "intro": "Pyrus sylvestris, commonly known as the European wild pear, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201315 meters, featuring a rounded crown and rough, fissured bark. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture and traditional medicine."
