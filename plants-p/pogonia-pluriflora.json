    "intro": "Pogonia pluriflora, commonly known as the many-flowered bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It thrives in acidic, peat-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. The plant produces numerous small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the late spring to early summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor environment in which it grows. Pogonia pluriflora is also known for its fragrant scent, which helps attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
