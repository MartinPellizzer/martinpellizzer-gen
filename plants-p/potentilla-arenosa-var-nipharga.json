    "intro": "Potentilla arenosa var. nipharga, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in harsh, arid environments, often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the summer months. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental plant."
