    "intro": "Peplis serpyllifolia, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Peplis serpyllifolia is also an important plant for pollinators, particularly bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
