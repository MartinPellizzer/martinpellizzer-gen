It features rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and violet, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
