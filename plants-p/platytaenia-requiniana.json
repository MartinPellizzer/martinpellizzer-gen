    "intro": "Platytaenia requiniana, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Platytaenia requiniana plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
