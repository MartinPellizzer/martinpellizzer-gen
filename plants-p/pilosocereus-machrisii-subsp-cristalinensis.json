    "intro": "Pilosocereus machrisii subsp. cristalinensis, commonly known as the cristalinensis cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in the summer. Its spines are relatively short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
