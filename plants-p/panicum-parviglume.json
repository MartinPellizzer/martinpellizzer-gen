    "intro": "Panicum parviglume, commonly known as littleseed panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its seeds are enclosed in narrow, glabrous bracts, which give it its scientific name. Panicum parviglume is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
