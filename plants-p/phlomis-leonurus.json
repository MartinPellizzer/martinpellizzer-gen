    "intro": "Phlomis leonurus, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features erect, branched stems that are often covered in soft, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces showy, purple or pink flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phlomis leonurus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
