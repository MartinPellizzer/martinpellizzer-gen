    "intro": "Parosela pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's parosela, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela pringlei is considered a vulnerable species."
