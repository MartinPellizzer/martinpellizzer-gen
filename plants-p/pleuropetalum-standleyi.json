    "intro": "Pleuropetalum standleyi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, oval berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
