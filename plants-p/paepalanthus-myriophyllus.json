It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
