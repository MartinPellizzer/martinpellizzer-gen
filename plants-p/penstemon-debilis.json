    "intro": "Penstemon debilis, commonly known as the weak penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender stems and produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. It is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal water once established. Penstemon debilis is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
