    "intro": "Phegopteris extensa, commonly known as the broad buckwheat fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a stout, unbranched rhizome and fronds that are deeply divided into segments. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium."
