It features rounded, glossy dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture, often marked by a pale midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with consistent moisture. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for indoor cultivation and tabletop displays."
