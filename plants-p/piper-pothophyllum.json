    "intro": "Piper pothophyllum, commonly known as the white pepper plant, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into three-lobed, green berries. These berries turn red when mature and contain the aromatic seeds used to make white pepper. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
