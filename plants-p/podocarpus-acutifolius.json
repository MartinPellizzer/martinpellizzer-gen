    "intro": "Podocarpus acutifolius, commonly known as the Mexican cedar, is a evergreen coniferous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The tree produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability to various soil types. The wood of Podocarpus acutifolius is durable and has been traditionally used for construction and furniture."
