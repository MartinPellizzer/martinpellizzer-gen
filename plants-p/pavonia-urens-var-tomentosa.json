It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of pink to red bract-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its showy inflorescences attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The hairy texture of its foliage and stems is a distinguishing botanical feature."
