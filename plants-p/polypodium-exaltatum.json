    "intro": "Polypodium exaltatum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium exaltatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
