    "intro": "Phoenicanthemum ensifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phoenicanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. It is known for its ornamental value and is often used in horticulture for its delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
