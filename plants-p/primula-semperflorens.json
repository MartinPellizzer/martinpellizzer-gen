    "intro": "Primula semperflorens, commonly known as the common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its ability to bloom continuously throughout the growing season contributes to its ornamental value."
