It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce aerial roots. Its fronds are typically divided into two sets of pinnae, giving it a finely divided, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
