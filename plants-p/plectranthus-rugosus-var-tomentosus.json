    "intro": "Plectranthus rugosus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly plectranthus, is a compact, bushy plant native to South Africa. It features hairy, velvety leaves that give it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or lilac, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
