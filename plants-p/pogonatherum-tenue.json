    "intro": "Pogonatherum tenue, commonly known as narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, often forming dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Pogonatherum tenue is characterized by its ability to thrive in dry and nutrient-poor environments, making it an important component of many ecological systems."
