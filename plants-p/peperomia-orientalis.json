    "intro": "Peperomia orientalis, commonly known as the Japanese peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in both homes and offices."
