    "intro": "Polygonum weyrichii var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense clusters. The plant features slender stems covered in soft hairs and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly serrated margin. Polygonum weyrichii var. alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
