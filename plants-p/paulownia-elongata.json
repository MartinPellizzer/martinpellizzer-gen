    "intro": "Paulownia elongata, commonly known as the Chinese empress tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rapid growth, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, and its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its light weight and strength, making it popular in furniture and musical instrument making. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
