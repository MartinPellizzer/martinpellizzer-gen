    "intro": "Polygonum roseoviride var. manshuricola, commonly known as the Manshurian rose-green polygonum, is a variant of the rose-green knotweed. It is characterized by its striking pinkish-green foliage, which is a result of its unique pigmentation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its stems are erect and somewhat woody, with small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
