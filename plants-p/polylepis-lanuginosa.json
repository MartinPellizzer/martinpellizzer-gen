    "intro": "Polylepis lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly polylepis, is a tree species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and a distinctive, rugged appearance. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Polylepis lanuginosa is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a keystone species in its habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is also considered an endangered species."
