    "intro": "Populus tremula var. davidiana, commonly known as the David's trembling poplar, is a variant of the European aspen. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that tremble in the wind due to the presence of a specialized leaf stalk. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a samara, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. This species is notable for its adaptability and ecological importance in supporting biodiversity."
