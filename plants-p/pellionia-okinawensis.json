    "intro": "Pellionia okinawensis, commonly known as the Okinawa Pellionia, is a rare tropical plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a low-growing, herbaceous species characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and the plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
