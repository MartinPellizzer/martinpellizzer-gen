    "intro": "Pleurothallopsis mulderae, commonly known as the Mulder's pleurothallis, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with delicate, often fragrant petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a slender stem and narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that help it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
