    "intro": "Papaver \u00d7 boissierianum, commonly known as the Boissier's poppy, is a hybrid species within the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically range in color from red to orange, with a distinctive black or dark red center. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings with proper care."
