    "intro": "Polylobium humifusum, commonly known as the groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, hard, seed-containing fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its resilience and ability to colonize various habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
