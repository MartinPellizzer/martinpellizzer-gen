    "intro": "Parsonsia caeciliae, commonly known as the Caesar's candle or the yellow flame plant, is a striking member of the\u841d\u85e6\u79d1 (Asclepiadaceae) family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its vibrant yellow-orange flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences and resemble candles, hence its common name. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Parsonsia caeciliae is a popular ornamental plant due to its showy blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
