    "intro": "Potentilla cespitosa, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically silver-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Potentilla cespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in garden settings."
