    "intro": "Polypodium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock faces or soil in forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to vertical surfaces. Polypodium serrulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
