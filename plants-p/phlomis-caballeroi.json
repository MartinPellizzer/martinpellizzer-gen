    "intro": "Phlomis caballeroi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
