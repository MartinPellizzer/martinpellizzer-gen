    "intro": "Potentilla recta proles crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported astringent properties."
