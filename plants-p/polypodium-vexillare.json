    "intro": "Polypodium vexillare, commonly known as the veiled fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a veiled appearance. The plant is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across forest floors, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium vexillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
