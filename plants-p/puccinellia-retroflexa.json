    "intro": "Puccinellia retroflexa, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas and inland salt flats. Puccinellia retroflexa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
