    "intro": "Poa arvensis, commonly known as common bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. Poa arvensis is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
