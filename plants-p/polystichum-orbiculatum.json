    "intro": "Polystichum orbiculatum, commonly known as the round-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, rounded leaves that are divided into numerous segments, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Polystichum orbiculatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in shaded garden settings."
