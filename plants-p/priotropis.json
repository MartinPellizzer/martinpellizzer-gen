It is characterized by its small, often clustered flowers and woody stems, which are typically covered in a distinctive red or orange bark. The leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Priotropis species are native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
