    "intro": "Pectis exserta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically followed by fluffy, seed-filled structures that aid in wind dispersal. Pectis exserta is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
