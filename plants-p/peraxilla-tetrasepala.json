It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas due to its adaptability and rapid growth. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and a potential weed in cultivated landscapes."
