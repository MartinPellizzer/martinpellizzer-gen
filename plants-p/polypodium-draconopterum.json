    "intro": "Polypodium draconopterum, commonly known as the dragon's wing fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a dense covering of small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its host, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
