    "intro": "Polypodium lanugisosum, commonly known as the woolly polypody, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds covered in a fine, woolly layer of trichomes, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
