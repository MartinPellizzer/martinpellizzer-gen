    "intro": "Plantaginella carinata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Plantaginella carinata is valued for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
