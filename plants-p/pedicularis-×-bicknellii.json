    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 bicknellii, commonly known as the Bicknell's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling the appearance of insect larvae. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
