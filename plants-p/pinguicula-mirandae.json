    "intro": "Pinguicula mirandae, commonly known as the Mirandian butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
