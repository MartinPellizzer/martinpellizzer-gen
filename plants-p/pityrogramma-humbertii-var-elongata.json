    "intro": "Pityrogramma humbertii var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pityrogramma. It is a small, aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and marshy areas. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are thin and wiry, allowing it to spread along the substrate. The species is characterized by its finely divided leaves and is often found in shaded, humid habitats."
