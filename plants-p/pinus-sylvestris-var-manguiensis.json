    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. manguiensis, commonly known as the Chinese white pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The leaves are typically soft and flexible, arranged in bundles of five, and have a bluish-green color. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed cones that release seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
