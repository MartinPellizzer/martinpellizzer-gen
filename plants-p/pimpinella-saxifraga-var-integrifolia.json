    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are typically smooth-edged, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
