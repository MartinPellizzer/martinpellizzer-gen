    "intro": "Polypodium fluminense, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along riverbanks and in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
