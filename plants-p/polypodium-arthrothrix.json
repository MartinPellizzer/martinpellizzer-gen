    "intro": "Polypodium arthrothrix, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium arthrothrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
