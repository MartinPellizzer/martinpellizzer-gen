    "intro": "Polemonium foliosissimum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine leafy polemonium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in cooler climates. The species is also notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude environments."
