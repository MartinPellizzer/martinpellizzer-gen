It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red flowers and aromatic leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The fruit, which is a small, reddish berry, is used both for its flavor and medicinal properties."
