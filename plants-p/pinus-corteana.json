    "intro": "Pinus corteana, commonly known as the Canary Island pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in fascicles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and often persist on the branches for several years. It thrives in volcanic soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat. The species is also cultivated in other regions with similar climatic conditions for ornamental and ecological purposes."
