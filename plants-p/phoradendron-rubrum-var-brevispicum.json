    "intro": "Phoradendron rubrum var. brevispicum, commonly known as the short-spined mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by berries that are red when mature. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new host trees. The plant's hemiparasitic nature means it derives some nutrients from its host but can also photosynthesize."
