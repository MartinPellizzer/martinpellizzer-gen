    "intro": "Primula rupicola, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Primula rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
