    "intro": "Phialanthus stillans, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, ovate leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stem. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Its root system includes haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Despite its parasitic nature, Phialanthus stillans plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
