It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate appearance and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
