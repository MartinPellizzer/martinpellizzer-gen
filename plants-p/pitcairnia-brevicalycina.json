    "intro": "Pitcairnia brevicalycina, commonly known as the short calyx pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, short-lived inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Pitcairnia brevicalycina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
