    "intro": "Polypodium barbatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait among ferns."
