    "intro": "Physkium natans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant is entirely submerged, with its leaves and stems adapted for life in water. It is found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Physkium natans is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival."
