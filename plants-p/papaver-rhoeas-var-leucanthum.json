    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. leucanthum, commonly known as the white poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and open fields. The plant features a short, thick stem with lobed leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate, almost ethereal appearance to gardens and natural habitats. Due to its unique coloration, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
