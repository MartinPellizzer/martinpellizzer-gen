    "intro": "Pteris lomariacea var. digitatopalmata, commonly known as the digitate palm fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is characterized by its fronds that are pinnately divided with a distinctive digitate (finger-like) appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are often glossy and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
