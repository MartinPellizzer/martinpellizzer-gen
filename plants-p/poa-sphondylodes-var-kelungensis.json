    "intro": "Poa sphondylodes var. kelungensis, commonly known as the Kelung sedge, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological adaptations to wetland environments and its role in stabilizing soil in such habitats."
