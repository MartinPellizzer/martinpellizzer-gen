    "intro": "Pteridrys australis, commonly known as the Southern Brake, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Pteridrys australis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
