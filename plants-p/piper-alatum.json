    "intro": "Piper alatum, commonly known as the climbing pepper or Indian pepper vine, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture and emit a mild peppery scent. Piper alatum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its use in traditional medicine."
