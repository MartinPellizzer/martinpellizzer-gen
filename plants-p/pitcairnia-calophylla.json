    "intro": "Pitcairnia calophylla, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear clusters of vibrant, bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. Pitcairnia calophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
