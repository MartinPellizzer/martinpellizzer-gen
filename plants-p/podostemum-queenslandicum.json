    "intro": "Podostemum queenslandicum, commonly known as the Queensland waterstar, is a rare aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers and its unique adaptation to grow in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant typically thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters with ample sunlight. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers emerge just above the water surface. Podostemum queenslandicum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
