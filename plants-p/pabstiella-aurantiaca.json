    "intro": "Pabstiella aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
