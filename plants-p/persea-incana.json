    "intro": "Persea incana, commonly known as the rough-leaved avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy texture on its leaves and bark, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers and develops a fruit similar to the avocado, though it is less commonly cultivated for consumption. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The tree thrives in humid, warm climates and is valued for both its ornamental and potential medicinal uses."
