    "intro": "Panicum procurrens var. solutum, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often visible in late summer. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in poorly drained soils. This variety is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions and ability to stabilize soil."
