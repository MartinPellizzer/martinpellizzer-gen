It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking rose-pink bracts that surround small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a peppery scent, typical of many Piper species.
