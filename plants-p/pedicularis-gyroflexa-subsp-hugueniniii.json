    "intro": "Pedicularis gyroflexa subsp. hugueniniii, commonly known as the Huguenin's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This subspecies is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers and its unique, spurred petals that resemble the shape of a louse. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
