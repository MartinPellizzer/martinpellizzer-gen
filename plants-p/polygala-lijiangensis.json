    "intro": "Polygala lijiangensis, commonly known as the Liangjiang polygala, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, often pink or white flowers are adapted for insect pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
