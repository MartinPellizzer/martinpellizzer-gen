It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive, bright-colored top that often resembles a moon or a flower. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
