    "intro": "Poa alpina var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the alpine bluegrass species native to high-altitude regions. It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh mountain climates with limited soil and nutrients."
