    "intro": "Phyllanthus manausensis, commonly known as the Manaus spurge, is a shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, greenish fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native region."
