    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces spherical, smooth-barked trunks and is often found in moist, shady environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a three-winged samara that aids in wind dispersal. This variant is closely related to the common sycamore but exhibits distinct morphological features adapted to its mountainous habitat."
