    "intro": "Pyrostria buxifolia var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered pyrostria, is a rare and unique variant of the pyrostria plant. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that resembles that of a boxwood, giving it its species name *buxifolia*. The plant produces a single, striking white flower at the tip of each branch, which makes it visually distinctive. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
