    "intro": "Pilosella frigidaria, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Pilosella frigidaria typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil in high-altitude environments. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
