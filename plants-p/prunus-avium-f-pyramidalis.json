    "intro": "Prunus avium f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal sweet cherry, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry tree characterized by its upright, conical growth habit. It is a compact and narrow-growing form, making it suitable for smaller spaces or as a ornamental tree. The plant produces large, showy white flowers in early spring, followed by sweet, juicy red fruit in summer. It is valued for its aesthetic appeal and edible yield, though it may be less cold-hardy than other cherry varieties. This form is often used in horticultural settings for its structured appearance and reliable fruit production."
