    "intro": "Pritchardia kahukuensis, commonly known as the Kahuku palaui, is a rare cycad native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is adapted to the dry, coastal habitats of its native range, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered, with very few mature individuals remaining in the wild. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
