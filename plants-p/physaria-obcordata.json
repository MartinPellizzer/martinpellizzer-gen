It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its striking, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are linear and often have a bluish-green hue, while its stems are erect and branching. Physaria obcordata is known for its unique seed pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds explosively."
