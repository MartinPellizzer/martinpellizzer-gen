    "intro": "Pteris decipiens, commonly known as the false water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pteris decipiens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
