It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a single, slender stem and a single, showy white flower. The plant is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, fleshy rhizome and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
