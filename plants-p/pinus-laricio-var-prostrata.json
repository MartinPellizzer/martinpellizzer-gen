    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. prostrata, commonly known as the creeping larch, is a low-growing variant of the larch tree native to the Alps and Carpathian regions. It is characterized by its prostrate or creeping growth habit, with multiple stems spreading along the ground. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain needle-like leaves, which turn golden in autumn. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various small organisms. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or poor soils."
