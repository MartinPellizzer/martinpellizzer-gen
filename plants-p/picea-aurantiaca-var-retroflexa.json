    "intro": "Picea aurantiaca var. retroflexa, commonly known as the red spruce, is a variant of the red spruce species native to the high altitudes of the Appalachian Mountains. This evergreen conifer is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its distinctive reddish-brown bark. Its needles are short, stiff, and covered in a whitish bloom, giving the tree a unique appearance. The cones are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this variety is considered vulnerable and is of significant ecological importance in its native range."
