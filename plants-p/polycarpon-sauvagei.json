    "intro": "Polycarpon sauvagei, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and umbel-shaped flower heads that resemble a lace doily. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are white with a single red or purple flower at the center, which is a distinctive feature. The seeds are small and have a unique, ridged appearance, aiding in their dispersal by wind."
