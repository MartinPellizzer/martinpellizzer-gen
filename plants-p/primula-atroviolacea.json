    "intro": "Primula atroviolacea, commonly known as the black violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its striking dark purple to almost black petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves and clustered flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
