    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to South America. It is a fern that thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams and in humid forests. The plant has fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
