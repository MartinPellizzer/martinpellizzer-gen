    "intro": "Paesia viscosa, commonly known as sticky paesia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive texture. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough surface. Paesia viscosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
