    "intro": "Peltandra angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features a rhizomatous underground stem that gives rise to erect, narrow leaves with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by the development of arrowhead-shaped tubers. These tubers are edible and have been traditionally used as a starchy food source. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
