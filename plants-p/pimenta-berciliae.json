    "intro": "Pimenta berciliae, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, red, fleshy fruits. The plant produces aromatic leaves and flowers that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal forests and disturbed soils. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
