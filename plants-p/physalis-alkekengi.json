    "intro": "Physalis alkekengi, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or winter cherry, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit, which resembles a small lantern. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into the distinctive, papery fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing as an annual or perennial depending on the climate. The fruit is edible when fully ripe but can be toxic if consumed unripe."
