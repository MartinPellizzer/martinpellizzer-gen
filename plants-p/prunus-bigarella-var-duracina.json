    "intro": "Prunus bigarella var. duracina, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Japan. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, adding a soft, ethereal beauty to gardens. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for container gardening or as a focal point in small spaces. The fruit, though not typically edible, adds a subtle ornamental interest with its small, red berries appearing in late summer."
