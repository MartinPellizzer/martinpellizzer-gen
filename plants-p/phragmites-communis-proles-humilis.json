    "intro": "Phragmites communis proles humilis, commonly known as the dwarf common reed, is a flowering plant species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its widespread distribution. This subspecies is often distinguished from other Phragmites species by its shorter stature and specific ecological preferences."
