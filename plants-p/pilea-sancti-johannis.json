    "intro": "Pilea sancti-johannis, commonly known as the friendship plant or Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its glossy, round leaves that resemble coins, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea sancti-johannis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
