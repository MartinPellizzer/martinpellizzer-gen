    "intro": "Phegopteris pycnolepis, commonly known as the thick-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with floating leaves that are divided into numerous small, serrated segments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, dense venation pattern. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
