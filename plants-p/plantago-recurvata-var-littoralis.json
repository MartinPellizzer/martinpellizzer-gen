    "intro": "Plantago recurvata var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to saline environments. The plant features erect, branching stems with lance-shaped leaves that have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces capsules containing numerous seeds. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
