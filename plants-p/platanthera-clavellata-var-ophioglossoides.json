    "intro": "Platanthera clavellata var. ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and moist meadows in North America. It produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant's most striking feature is its clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are arranged in a spike and emit a faint, sweet fragrance. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more elongated floral structure compared to the typical form of Platanthera clavellata."
