    "intro": "Physocalymma floridum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils in open habitats such as dunes, prairies, and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
