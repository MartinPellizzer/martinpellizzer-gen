    "intro": "Purdiaea nipensis var. alainii, commonly known as the Alain's rockcress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
