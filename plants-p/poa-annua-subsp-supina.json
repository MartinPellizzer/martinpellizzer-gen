    "intro": "Poa annua subsp. supina, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in lawns, golf courses, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to spread through both rhizomes and stolons, making it highly competitive. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
