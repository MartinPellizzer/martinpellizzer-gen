It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered with small, raised bumps or warts. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by a layer of indusium. Polypodium verrucosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
