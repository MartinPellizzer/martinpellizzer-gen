    "intro": "Pteris trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically pinnately compound. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface. Pteris trifoliolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
