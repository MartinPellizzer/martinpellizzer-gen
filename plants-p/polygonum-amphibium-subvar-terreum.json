    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium subvar. terreum, commonly known as the terrestrial knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with soft, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It is often found in moist soils along riverbanks, ponds, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
