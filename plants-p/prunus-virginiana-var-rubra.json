    "intro": "Prunus virginiana var. rubra, commonly known as the red chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and reddish stems, which become more prominent with age. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning bright red in the fall. The species is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
