    "intro": "Pentanisia sykesii, commonly known as the Sykes' pentanisia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
