    "intro": "Pandanus problematicus, commonly known as the swamp pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in wet, swampy environments and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a leafy bract, and it produces small, fragrant flowers. The fruit, which is a fibrous capsule, contains seeds that are dispersed by water or animals."
