    "intro": "Phellocarpus acutus, commonly known as the sharpleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches and small, elliptical leaves with a sharp apex. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
