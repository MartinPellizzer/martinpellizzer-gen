    "intro": "Prunus prostrata var. concolor, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed cherry or concolor cherry, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or cascading structures. The leaves are elliptical, glossy, and dark green, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other Prunus species. Small, white flowers appear in spring, followed by dark red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
