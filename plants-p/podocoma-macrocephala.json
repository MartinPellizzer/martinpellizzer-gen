    "intro": "Podocoma macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed podocarp, is a unique evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
