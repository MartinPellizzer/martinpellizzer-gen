It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Pteroselinum glaucum is valued for its aromatic foliage, which is used in cooking and traditional medicine."
