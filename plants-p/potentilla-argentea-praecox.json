It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name and help reflect sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Potentilla argentea praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control."
