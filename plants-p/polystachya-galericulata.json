    "intro": "Polystachya galericulata, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers with distinctive purple veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps retain moisture. Polystachya galericulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
