    "intro": "Phagnalon pumilum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly phagnalon, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
