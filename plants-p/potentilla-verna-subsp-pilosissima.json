    "intro": "Potentilla verna subsp. pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name \"pilosissima,\" meaning \"very hairy.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
