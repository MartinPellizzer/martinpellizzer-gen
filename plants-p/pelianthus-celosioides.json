    "intro": "Pelianthus celosioides, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are surrounded by a dense ring of bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
