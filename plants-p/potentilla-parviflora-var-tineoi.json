    "intro": "Potentilla parviflora var. tineoi, commonly known as the Tineo's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for harsh climates and it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
