It is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known species like eucalyptus and tea tree. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.
