    "intro": "Petasites niveus var. paradoxus, commonly known as the white foamflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its distinctive white, fluffy bracts that resemble foam. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense colonies in moist, shady woodland habitats. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
