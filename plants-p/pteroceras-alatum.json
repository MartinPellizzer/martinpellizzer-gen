    "intro": "Pteroceras alatum, commonly known as the winged shield fern, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments with a prominent, wing-like structure on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive, feathery appearance."
