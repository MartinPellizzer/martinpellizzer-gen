    "intro": "Polypodium falciforme, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that resemble a sword, typically reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in shaded areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young."
