    "intro": "Peperomia rupestris f. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions. It features thick, waxy leaves that are heart-shaped, providing a distinctive ornamental appearance. The plant has short, sturdy stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
