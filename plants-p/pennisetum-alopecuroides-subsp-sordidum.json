    "intro": "Pennisetum alopecuroides subsp. sordidum, commonly known as purple muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and its striking purple to pink plumes that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
