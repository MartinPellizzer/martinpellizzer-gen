It features wiry, sprawling stems that form dense mats, often covering rocky or gravelly ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. This species is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
