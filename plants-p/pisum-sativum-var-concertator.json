    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. concertator, commonly known as the concertina pea, is a variety of garden pea characterized by its unique, curled pod shape that resembles a concertina. It is an annual legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, producing clusters of small, white or violet flowers that develop into the distinctive, spiral-shaped pods. The seeds inside the pods are usually round and edible, similar to other pea varieties, and are often used in culinary applications. This variety is favored for its ornamental value as well as its culinary versatility."
