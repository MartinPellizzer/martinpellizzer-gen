It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies."
