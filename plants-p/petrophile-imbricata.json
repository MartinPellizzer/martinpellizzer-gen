It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. The plant produces striking red or pink bottlebrush-shaped flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in whorls around the stems. Petrophile imbricata is well adapted to arid conditions and is an important component of the local flora."
