    "intro": "Parodia scopa subsp. neobuenekeri, commonly known as the Neobuenekeri Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, radial spines that give it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
