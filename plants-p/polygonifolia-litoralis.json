    "intro": "Polygonifolia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal polygonum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline, demonstrating adaptability to tidal fluctuations. Its root system helps stabilize coastal sediments, making it ecologically significant in beach ecosystems."
