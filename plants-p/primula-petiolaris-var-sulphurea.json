    "intro": "Primula petiolaris var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur primrose, is a rare and striking variant of the primula genus native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are often tinged with orange or sulfur-yellow hues, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs, which help to reflect light and reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
