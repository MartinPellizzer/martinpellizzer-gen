    "intro": "Prunus pendula f. ascendens, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a cultivar of the Prunus pendula species. It is characterized by its graceful, cascading branches that droop from the main stem, creating a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically pale pink or white, which bloom before the leaves emerge. Its foliage is deciduous, turning yellow in autumn, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun. This ornamental tree is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal beauty."
