    "intro": "Polystichum braunii subsp. alaskense, commonly known as the Alaska barren gall, is a fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically evergreen and persist through the winter. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
