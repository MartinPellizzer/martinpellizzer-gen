    "intro": "Pseudosedum campanuliflorum, commonly known as the bellflower sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, upright stems and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage, which helps the plant survive in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant's unique floral structure and drought tolerance contribute to its ornamental value in landscaping."
