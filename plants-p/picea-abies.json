It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, needle-like leaves, and distinctive cone structure. The tree thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal and montane forests. Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. The European spruce plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
