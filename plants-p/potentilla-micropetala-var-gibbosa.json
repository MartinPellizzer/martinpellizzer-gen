    "intro": "Potentilla micropetala var. gibbosa, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
