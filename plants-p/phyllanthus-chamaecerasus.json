It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are often grouped in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant."
