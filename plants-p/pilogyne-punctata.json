    "intro": "Pilogyne punctata, commonly known as the spotted milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to certain regions of Africa. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves with distinctive yellowish or brownish spots. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is latex-like, contains chemicals that can deter herbivores. Pilogyne punctata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, open habitats."
