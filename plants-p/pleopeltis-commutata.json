    "intro": "Pleopeltis commutata, commonly known as the veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb moisture from the air. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention."
