It is a perennial herb characterized by its blue or violet flowers and spiny, silver-green leaves. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its unique morphology includes a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that can grow up to 60 cm in height.
