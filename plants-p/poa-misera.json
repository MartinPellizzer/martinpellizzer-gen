    "intro": "Poa misera, commonly known as the meadow grass or sad grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing, perennial plant that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, Poa misera is relatively easy to cultivate and can serve as a useful ground cover in landscaping."
