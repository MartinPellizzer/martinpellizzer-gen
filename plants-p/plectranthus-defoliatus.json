    "intro": "Plectranthus defoliatus, commonly known as the silver bush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or blue, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Plectranthus defoliatus is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which can be used in herbal teas and as a natural air freshener."
