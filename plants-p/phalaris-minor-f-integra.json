It features slender, upright stems with narrow, dark green leaves that have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
