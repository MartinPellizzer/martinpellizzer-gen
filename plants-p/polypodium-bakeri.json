    "intro": "Polypodium bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and woody, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The spores are released from small, round structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
