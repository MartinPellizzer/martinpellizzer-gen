    "intro": "Panicum macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces large, showy spikelets that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant and often found in open areas such as prairies and disturbed sites. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
