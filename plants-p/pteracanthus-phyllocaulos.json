    "intro": "Pteracanthus phyllocaulos, commonly known as the feather-leaf fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
