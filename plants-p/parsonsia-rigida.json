    "intro": "Parsonsia rigida, commonly known as the rigid parsonsia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow or orange flowers, which are typically borne on long, drooping peduncles. These flowers are followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the plant's seeds. Parsonsia rigida is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils."
