    "intro": "Prunus davidiana f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered David plum, is a rare and ornamental variant of the David plum. It is characterized by its pale white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its dark green foliage. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China, typically growing in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its fruit, though edible, is small and somewhat tart. This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
