    "intro": "Pinus halepensis var. carica, commonly known as the Aleppo pine, is a variant of the Aleppo pine species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a tall, evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in fascicles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This variety is often used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
