    "intro": "Phanerophlebia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf phanerophlebia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or white in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
