    "intro": "Pouteria moaensis, commonly known as the Maori fig, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to figs, with a fibrous pulp and a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its historical and cultural significance to Indigenous communities, it holds ecological and ethnobotanical importance in the region."
