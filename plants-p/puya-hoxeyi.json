    "intro": "Puya hoxeyi, commonly known as the Hoxey's torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-shaped, evergreen leaves that form a dense rosette, creating a striking visual contrast with its showy flowers. Puya hoxeyi is a perennial, often growing up to 2 meters in height, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
