    "intro": "Polypodium bryopodum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that often grow on rocky surfaces. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium bryopodum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
