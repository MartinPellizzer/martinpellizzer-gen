    "intro": "Poecilostachys bathiei, commonly known as the African grass or Bathie's grass, is a species of perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it conserve water in arid environments. Poecilostachys bathiei is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
