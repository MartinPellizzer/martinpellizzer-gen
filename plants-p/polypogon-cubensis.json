    "intro": "Polypogon cubensis, commonly known as Cuban wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Polypogon cubensis is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sandy environments."
