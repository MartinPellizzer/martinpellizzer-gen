    "intro": "Pleurothallis muscifera, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
