    "intro": "Pinus heldreichii var. leucodermis, commonly known as the white-barked pine, is a rare and endangered variant of the Heldreich's pine. It is characterized by its distinctive white bark, which becomes more pronounced with age, and its needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Balkan Peninsula, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The plant produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
