It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stem and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in shaded environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is also known for its fragrant blooms, which attract various pollinators such as bees and moths."
