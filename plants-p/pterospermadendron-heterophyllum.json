    "intro": "Pterospermadendron heterophyllum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable to extinction."
