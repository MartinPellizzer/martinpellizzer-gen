    "intro": "Plectronia golungensis, commonly known as the golden spike plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow bracts that resemble spikes, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Plectronia golungensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
