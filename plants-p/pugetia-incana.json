It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering its leaves. It produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. Pugetia incana thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and desert regions."
