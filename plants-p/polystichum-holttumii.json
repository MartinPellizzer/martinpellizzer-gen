    "intro": "Polystichum holttumii, commonly known as the Holttum's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum holttumii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
