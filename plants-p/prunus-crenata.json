    "intro": "Prunus crenata, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow fruits that are edible but often considered less palatable than those of other apricot species. Prunus crenata thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blossoms and compact growth habit."
