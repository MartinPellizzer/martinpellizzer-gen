    "intro": "Pollinia grata, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Asia and North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces unique pollinia, which are compact masses of pollen that adhere to the bodies of pollinators. These pollinia are essential for its reproductive success, as they are transferred between plants by insects or other animals. Pollinia grata thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy environments."
