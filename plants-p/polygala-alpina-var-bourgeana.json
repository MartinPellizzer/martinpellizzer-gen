    "intro": "Polygala alpina var. bourgeana, commonly known as the Alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often covered in fine hairs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to flourish in poor soil conditions."
