    "intro": "Potentilla pentandra, commonly known as the five-angled potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant features elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces five-angled, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Potentilla pentandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
