    "intro": "Pelargonium auritum subsp. carneum, commonly known as the red-leaf geranium, is a species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often red or purple in color, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its succulent-like foliage and ornamental flowers make it both visually striking and relatively low-maintenance."
