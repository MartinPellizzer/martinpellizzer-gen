    "intro": "Pterophyton procerum, commonly known as the noble fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Pterophyta. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of modern ferns, though it is believed to have thrived during the Carboniferous period. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a sorus, which contains the spores necessary for its propagation. Its vascular system is well-developed, allowing it to efficiently transport water and nutrients. Due to its historical significance and rarity, Pterophyton procerum is a subject of great interest in paleobotanical research."
