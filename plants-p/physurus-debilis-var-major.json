    "intro": "Physurus debilis var. major, commonly known as the giant mouse-eared cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the base of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
