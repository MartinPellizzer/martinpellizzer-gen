    "intro": "Pereskia calandriniifolia, commonly known as the Cucurbitaceous Pereskia, is a unique cactus species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, leafy stems that resemble those of a shrub rather than a typical cactus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored berry that contains numerous seeds. Despite its appearance, it has adapted to arid environments with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
