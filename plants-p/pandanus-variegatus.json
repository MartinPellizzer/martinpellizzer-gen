It is characterized by its stiff, sword-like leaves that are often variegated with yellow and white markings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional crafts, while its leaves are used for thatching and weaving.
