    "intro": "Potentilla loppiensis, commonly known as Loppi's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Potentilla loppiensis is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
