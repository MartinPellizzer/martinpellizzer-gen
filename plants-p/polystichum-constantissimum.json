    "intro": "Polystichum constantissimum, commonly known as the constant mountain fern, is a species of dryopterid fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit."
