    "intro": "Pandanus obovoideus, commonly known as the broad-leafed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with fragrant, white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fibrous leaves are harvested for weaving baskets, mats, and other decorative items. The plant thrives in wet, coastal environments and is often found near mangroves or in swampy areas."
