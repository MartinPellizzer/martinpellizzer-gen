    "intro": "Pandanus breviendocarpicus, commonly known as the short-fruited pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers, which are followed by fleshy, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional weaving and construction, while the plant itself thrives in coastal and wetland environments. Pandanus breviendocarpicus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
