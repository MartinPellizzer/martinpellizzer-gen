    "intro": "Pilosocereus royenii, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and vibrant, colorful crown, which is often a different species grafted onto the main stem. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, and its growth is slow, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant."
