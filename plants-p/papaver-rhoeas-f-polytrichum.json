    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas f. polytrichum, commonly known as the multibract poppy, is a botanical variant of the common poppy. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring multiple bracts that give it a unique appearance compared to the typical single bract of the species. This form is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in various habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces showy red or orange flowers, which bloom in early summer. Its botanical significance lies in its variation in leaf structure, making it a subject of interest in plant taxonomy and horticulture."
