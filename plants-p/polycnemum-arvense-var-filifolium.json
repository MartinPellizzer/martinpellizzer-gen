    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense var. filifolium, commonly known as the filifolium variant of field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, fields, and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often tufted at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. This variety is distinguished by its finely divided, thread-like leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other Polycnemum species."
