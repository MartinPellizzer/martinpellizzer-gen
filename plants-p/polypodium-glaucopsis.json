    "intro": "Polypodium glaucopsis, commonly known as the green fern or mountain holly fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) appearance on the underside. Polypodium glaucopsis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
