    "intro": "Pavonia spinifex subsp. genuina, commonly known as the prickly pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to red bract-like flowers. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous true flowers within the bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and spiny stems compared to other forms of Pavonia spinifex."
