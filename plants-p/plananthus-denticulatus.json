    "intro": "Plananthus denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed plananthus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with fine, tooth-like serrations along the edges. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Plananthus denticulatus is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
