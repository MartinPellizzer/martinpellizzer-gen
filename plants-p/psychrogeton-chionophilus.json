    "intro": "Psychrogeton chionophilus, commonly known as the snow-loving plant, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low nutrient soils. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, appearing in clusters during the short growing season. Psychrogeton chionophilus plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine regions and is of interest to botanists studying cold-adapted flora."
