    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris f. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with large, showy purple to pink flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or calcareous soils. Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous nature, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts."
