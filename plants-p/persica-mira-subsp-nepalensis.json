It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, pink to white flowers. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that ripen to a yellow-orange color, often with a sweet and aromatic flavor. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
