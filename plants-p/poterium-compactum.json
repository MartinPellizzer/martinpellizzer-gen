    "intro": "Poterium compactum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers surrounded by white bracts, which bloom from late summer to autumn. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs."
