It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by round, white berries that resemble snowballs. These berries are edible for birds and small mammals, contributing to its ecological importance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
