It features prostrate or ascending stems covered with small, glandular hairs. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they often have a reddish or purple tinge. Small white to pale pink flowers are arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. This plant is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
