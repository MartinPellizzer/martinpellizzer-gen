    "intro": "Primula lacteocapitata, commonly known as the milkhead primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving them a milky appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its flowers have five petals and are arranged in a compact, rounded inflorescence. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early-season blooms."
