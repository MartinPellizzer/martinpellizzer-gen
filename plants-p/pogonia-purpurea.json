    "intro": "Pogonia purpurea, commonly known as the purple pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic woodlands and thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Pogonia purpurea is a protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
