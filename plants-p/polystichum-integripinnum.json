    "intro": "Polystichum integripinnum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, uninterrupted margin, giving the plant its specific epithet \"integripinnum.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
