    "intro": "Polycycnis, commonly known as the water plantain, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Alismataceae. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with some species having rhizomes that anchor them in wet soil. The flowers are small and clustered, often with three sepals and three petals, and are usually pale green or white. Polycycnis species are found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams across temperate regions. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and fish."
