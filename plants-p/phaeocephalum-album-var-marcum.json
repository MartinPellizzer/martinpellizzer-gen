    "intro": "Phaeocephalum album var. marcum, commonly known as the white-flowered ghostplant, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its pale green to white stems and small, translucent leaves that often appear ghostly in water. This variant is distinguished from the typical *Phaeocephalum album* by its lighter coloration and slightly different morphology. It thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, acidic substrates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
