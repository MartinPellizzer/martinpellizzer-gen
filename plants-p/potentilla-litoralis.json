    "intro": "Potentilla litoralis, commonly known as sea buckthorn, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers and narrow, silvery-green leaves that help it withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are rich in vitamins and have been used in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to harsh coastal environments makes it an important species in coastal ecology."
