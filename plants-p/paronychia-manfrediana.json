    "intro": "Paronychia manfrediana, commonly known as the Manfred's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland sandstone formations. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are white or pale blue, arranged in clusters and blooming in spring. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
