The plant's cones are small and woody, typically appearing in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh alpine conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
