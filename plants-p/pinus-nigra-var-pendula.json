    "intro": "Pinus nigra var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping black pine, is a striking evergreen conifer characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect. Native to the Mediterranean region, this variety of pine tree is known for its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters. It typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters, with a broad, rounded crown that becomes more pendulous with age. The tree produces cones that mature in the second year, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
