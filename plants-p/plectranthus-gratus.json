    "intro": "Plectranthus gratus, commonly known as the silver bush or silver leaf plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
