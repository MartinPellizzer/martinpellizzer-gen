    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis exserta, commonly known as the elongated lip orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale green, feature a prominent, elongated lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Pleurothallis exserta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral structure."
