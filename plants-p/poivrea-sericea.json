    "intro": "Poivrea sericea, commonly known as silverleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Poivrea sericea is adaptable to various soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
