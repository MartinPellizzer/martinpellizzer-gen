    "intro": "Polypodium tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shield-shaped, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical forest ecosystems."
