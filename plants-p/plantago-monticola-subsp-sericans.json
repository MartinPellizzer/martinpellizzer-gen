    "intro": "Plantago monticola subsp. sericans, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are borne on slender, leafless stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
