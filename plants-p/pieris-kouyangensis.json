    "intro": "Pieris kouyangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan pieris, is a species of evergreen shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many acid-loving plants. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
