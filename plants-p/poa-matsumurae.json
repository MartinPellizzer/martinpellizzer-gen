    "intro": "Poa matsumurae, commonly known as the Matsumura's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Japan. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Poaceae family."
