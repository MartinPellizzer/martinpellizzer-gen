    "intro": "Pilosella stoloniflora subsp. oligocephala, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks."
