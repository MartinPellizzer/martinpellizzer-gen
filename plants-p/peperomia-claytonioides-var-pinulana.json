    "intro": "Peperomia claytonioides var. pinulana, commonly known as the Mexican peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Central America. It features small, ovate leaves with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, often adorned with subtle veins. The plant produces tiny, clustered white flowers that are typically hidden among the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
