It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in forested areas and alpine meadows, often in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance."
