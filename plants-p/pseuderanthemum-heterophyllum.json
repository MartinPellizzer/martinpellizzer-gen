It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or white, with two lips, typical of the Acanthaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks."
