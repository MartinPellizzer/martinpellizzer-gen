    "intro": "Podophyllum peltatum f. aphyllum, commonly known as the white mayapple, is a variant of the mayapple plant characterized by its lack of the typical leaf lobes found in the species. This form exhibits a more rounded, shield-shaped leaf that is predominantly white to pale green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in temperate forests. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in horticulture."
