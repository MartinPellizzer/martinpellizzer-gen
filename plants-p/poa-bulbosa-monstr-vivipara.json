    "intro": "Poa bulbosa monstr. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bulbous grass, is a unique variant of the common bentgrass species. This plant exhibits viviparity, a reproductive strategy where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. Its growth habit includes a bulbous base that supports the development of new shoots. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and wetlands."
