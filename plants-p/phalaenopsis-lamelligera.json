    "intro": "Phalaenopsis lamelligera, commonly known as the broad-leaf phalaenopsis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Its flowers can last for several months, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The plant requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
