    "intro": "Panicum tamayonis, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of slender, open panicles that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Silver hairgrass is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
