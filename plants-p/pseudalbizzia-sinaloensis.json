It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers, which are arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in pods, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky soils. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in arid regions."
