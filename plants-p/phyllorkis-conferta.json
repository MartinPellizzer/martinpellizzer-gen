    "intro": "Phyllorkis conferta, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Phyllorkis conferta is well adapted to salty air and strong winds, making it a hardy species for coastal gardens."
