    "intro": "Phoradendron terminale, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or green flowers and red berries that are often used in holiday decorations. Its growth is slow, and it can live for decades, forming dense clusters on its host. Phoradendron terminale plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
