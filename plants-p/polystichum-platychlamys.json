    "intro": "Polystichum platychlamys, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
