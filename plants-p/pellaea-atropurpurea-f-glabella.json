    "intro": "Pellaea atropurpurea f. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous mountain maid, is a fern species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark purple to blackish fronds that are often glabrous, meaning they lack hairy or fuzzy textures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically arranged in lines along the fronds. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive, glossy appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
