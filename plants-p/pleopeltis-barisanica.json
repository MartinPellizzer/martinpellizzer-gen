    "intro": "Pleopeltis barisanica, commonly known as the Barisan rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habits. Its leaves are usually green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pleopeltis barisanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
