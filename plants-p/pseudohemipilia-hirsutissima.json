    "intro": "Pseudohemipilia hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy pseudohemipilia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
