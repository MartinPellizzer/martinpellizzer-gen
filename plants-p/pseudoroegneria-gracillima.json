    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria gracillima, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
