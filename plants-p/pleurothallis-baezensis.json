It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces blooms during the warmer months of the year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
