    "intro": "Polypodium brachyphlebium, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest floors. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
