    "intro": "Portulaca ciferrii, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, vibrant red flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Portulaca ciferrii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
