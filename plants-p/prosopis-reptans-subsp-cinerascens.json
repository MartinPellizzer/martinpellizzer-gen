    "intro": "Prosopis reptans subsp. cinerascens, commonly known as the silverleaf mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It has deep roots that allow it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. This subspecies is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
