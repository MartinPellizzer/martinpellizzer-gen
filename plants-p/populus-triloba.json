    "intro": "Populus triloba, commonly known as the eastern cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a cotton-like covering, which are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in floodplain areas. The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age."
