    "intro": "Phoradendron crispuliforme, commonly known as the curlyleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropics. It has small, leathery leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by berries that are dispersed by birds. It relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. Its presence can affect the health of the host tree and is often found in forest ecosystems."
