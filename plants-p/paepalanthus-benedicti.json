    "intro": "Paepalanthus benedicti, commonly known as the Benedict's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a dense covering of spines and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. The plant is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems."
