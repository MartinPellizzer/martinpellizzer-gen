    "intro": "Pleiospilos longibracteatus, commonly known as the giant eagle's claw, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in dense, spiky bracts that give it its common name. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its adaptations include storing water in its stem to survive in arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
