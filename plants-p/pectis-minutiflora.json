    "intro": "Pectis minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf pectis, is a small, flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Pectis minutiflora is often found in open woodlands and along canyon walls, where it thrives in full sun."
