    "intro": "Psilotrichum majus, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Psilotrichum majus is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
