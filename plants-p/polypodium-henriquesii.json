    "intro": "Polypodium henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' holly fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
