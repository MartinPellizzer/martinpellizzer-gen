    "intro": "Pyrostria orientalis, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a species of cycad native to China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base and female cones emerging from the crown. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens."
