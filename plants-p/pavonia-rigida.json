    "intro": "Pavonia rigida, commonly known as rigid pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features showy, pink to red bracts that resemble petals, though it lacks true flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pavonia rigida is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
