    "intro": "Pterisanthes pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful pterisanthes, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Pterisanthes pulchra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
