    "intro": "Prunus maackii, commonly known as the Chinese flowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, yellow, edible fruits. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy blooms and adaptability to various soil types. Prunus maackii is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
