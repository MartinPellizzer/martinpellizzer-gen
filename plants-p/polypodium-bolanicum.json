    "intro": "Polypodium bolanicum, commonly known as the Bolan cliff fern, is a species of polypodioid fern found in the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. This fern is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and is often used in traditional medicine."
