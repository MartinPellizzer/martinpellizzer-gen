    "intro": "Polypodium grandiceps, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are divided into shield-shaped segments, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its distinctive appearance."
