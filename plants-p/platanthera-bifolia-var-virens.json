    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. virens, commonly known as the green-veined lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded woodlands in North America. It features a slender, erect stem with numerous pale green to white flowers arranged in a loose, spiraling raceme. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct greenish hue, contributing to its common name. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It blooms in late summer, typically from July to August, and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
