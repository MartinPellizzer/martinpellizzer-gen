    "intro": "Polylepis racemosa var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which provides insulation against the cold and arid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. The plant has compound leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
