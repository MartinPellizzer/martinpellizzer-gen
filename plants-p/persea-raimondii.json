    "intro": "Persea raimondii, commonly known as the Cuban avocado or raimond\u2019s persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it bears fruit that is similar in appearance to an avocado but with a distinct flavor. Persea raimondii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
