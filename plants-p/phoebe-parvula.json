    "intro": "Phoebe parvula, commonly known as the dwarf phoebe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. Its compact size and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, decorative plant. Phoebe parvula thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil."
