    "intro": "Pinus densiflora, commonly known as the Japanese black pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan and southern Korea. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and a distinctive, rugged trunk with a thick, fissured bark. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, where it is resistant to salt spray. The plant is valued for its hardiness and is commonly used in ornamental horticulture."
