    "intro": "Patonia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved patonia, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features slender, upright stems that produce small, white or pale pink flowers clustered at the tips. The leaves are lance-shaped, smooth, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. This plant is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local insect populations."
