    "intro": "Paullinia hemiptera, commonly known as the Brazilian soursop or the Brazilian custard apple, is a member of the Sapotaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are typically small and yellowish-green, and it produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but smaller. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained, fertile soils."
