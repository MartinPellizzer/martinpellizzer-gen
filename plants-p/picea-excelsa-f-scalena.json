    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. scalena, commonly known as the scalene white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This form is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The cones are small and woody, containing two to three seeds, and the tree is valued for its timber and ecological role in mountainous regions. Its genetic distinctiveness makes it an important subject for botanical and genetic studies."
