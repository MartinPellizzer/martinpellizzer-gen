    "intro": "Phaeneilema scapiflorum, commonly known as the scarlet ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of vibrant red flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Phaeneilema scapiflorum is considered endangered and requires protected environments to survive."
