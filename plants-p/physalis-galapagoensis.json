    "intro": "Physalis galapagoensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos huskfruit, is a unique species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its inflated, papery calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in the island's volcanic soil. Its fruit, which is small and yellowish, contains several seeds and is adapted to disperse via birds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
