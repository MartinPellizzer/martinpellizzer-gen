    "intro": "Pseudomaxillaria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces its flowers during the summer months, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
