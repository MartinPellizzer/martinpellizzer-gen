    "intro": "Phyllorkis pipio, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, drooping clusters of yellow flowers that resemble small raindrops, hence its common name. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The golden rain tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
