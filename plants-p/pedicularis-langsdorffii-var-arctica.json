    "intro": "Pedicularis langsdorffii var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic lousewort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking red or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in extreme cold and short growing seasons."
