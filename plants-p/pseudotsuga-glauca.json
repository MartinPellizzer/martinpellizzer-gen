    "intro": "Pseudotsuga glauca, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, bluish-green needles and a conical shape that becomes more irregular with age. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing edible seeds. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in mountainous regions. The white fir is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed forests."
