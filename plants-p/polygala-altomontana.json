    "intro": "Polygala altomontana, commonly known as the high mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, often clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, indehiscent fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Polygala altomontana is considered a rare and endemic species."
