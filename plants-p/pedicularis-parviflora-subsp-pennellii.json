    "intro": "Pedicularis parviflora subsp. pennellii, commonly known as the small-flowered lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. The species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred structure that aids in pollination by insects. The subspecies pennellii is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of Pedicularis parviflora."
