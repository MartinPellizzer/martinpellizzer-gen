    "intro": "Phegopteris fallax, commonly known as the common cliffbrake, is a fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Phegopteris fallax is often found in acidic soils and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
