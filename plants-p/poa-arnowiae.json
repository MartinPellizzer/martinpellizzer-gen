    "intro": "Poa arnowiae, commonly known as the Arnow's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Poa arnowiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh mountainous conditions."
