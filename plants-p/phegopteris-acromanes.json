    "intro": "Phegopteris acromanes, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The botanical features of Phegopteris acromanes make it well adapted to its specific ecological niche."
