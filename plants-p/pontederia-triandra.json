    "intro": "Pontederia triandra, commonly known as the purple pickerelweed, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water repellence. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Pontederia triandra is often found in shallow water, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
