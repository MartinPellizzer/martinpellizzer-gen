    "intro": "Pelma fractiflexum, commonly known as the brittle flex vine, is a climbing plant native to the temperate rainforests of southern Patagonia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems that can bend and twist around supports, allowing it to climb efficiently. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers are small, pale green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. The plant is noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, nutrient-rich soils."
