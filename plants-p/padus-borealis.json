    "intro": "Padus borealis, commonly known as the northern white cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its cones are woody and contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps or along riverbanks. This species is valued for its durable, aromatic wood and its ecological role in supporting various wildlife species."
