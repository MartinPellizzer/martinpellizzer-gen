    "intro": "Pteris trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. The fronds are usually green, with a pale underside, and the plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaves. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
