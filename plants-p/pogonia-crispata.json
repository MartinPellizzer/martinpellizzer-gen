    "intro": "Pogonia crispata, commonly known as the fragrant pinegrass, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in acidic soils. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring to early summer."
