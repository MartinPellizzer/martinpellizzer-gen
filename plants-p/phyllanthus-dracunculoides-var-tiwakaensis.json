    "intro": "Phyllanthus dracunculoides var. tiwakaensis, commonly known as the Tiwaka milkweed, is a shrub native to the Pacific Islands, particularly found in Tonga and Samoa. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are broken, which is a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
