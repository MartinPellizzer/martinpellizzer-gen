    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus choapensis, commonly known as the Choap\u00e9 cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
