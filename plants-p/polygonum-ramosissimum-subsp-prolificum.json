It is characterized by its upright stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist soils, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along streambanks. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
