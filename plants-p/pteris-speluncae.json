    "intro": "Pteris speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid caves and is adapted to low-light conditions. The plant has small, finely divided fronds that help it capture moisture from the air. Its spores are dispersed through the cave system, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its unique habitat, Pteris speluncae is considered a specialist species with limited distribution."
