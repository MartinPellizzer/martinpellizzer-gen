    "intro": "Psammisia idalima, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the sandy coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
