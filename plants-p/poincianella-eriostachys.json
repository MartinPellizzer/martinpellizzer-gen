It is characterized by its striking, feathery inflorescences that produce clusters of small, pink or red flowers. The plant has compound leaves with delicate, thread-like leaflets that give it a lacy appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Poincianella eriostachys is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
