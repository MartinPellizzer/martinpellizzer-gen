It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and feathery, branched inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, slightly hairy texture. Pycreus poikilostachys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, airy foliage."
