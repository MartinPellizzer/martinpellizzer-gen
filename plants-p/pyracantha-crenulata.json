    "intro": "Pyracantha crenulata, commonly known as the variegated firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with white or yellow variegation, which add visual interest to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by bright orange-red berries in autumn. These berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, making them popular with birds. Pyracantha crenulata is valued for its ornamental value, hardiness, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
