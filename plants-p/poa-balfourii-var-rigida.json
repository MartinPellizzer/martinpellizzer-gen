    "intro": "Poa balfourii var. rigida, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a mat-like structure. The leaves are narrow, rough, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in dry conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common component of alpine and subalpine vegetation."
