    "intro": "Polystachya \u00d7 nebulicola, commonly known as the nebulous spikegrass, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
