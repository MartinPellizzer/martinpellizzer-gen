    "intro": "Pteris minor, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to bluish-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as ponds, streams, and damp forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
