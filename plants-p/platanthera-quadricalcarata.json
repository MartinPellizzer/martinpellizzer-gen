    "intro": "Platanthera quadricalcarata, commonly known as the four-ribbed lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive inflorescence of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a slender, rhizomatous root system and produces small, yellowish-brown seeds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
