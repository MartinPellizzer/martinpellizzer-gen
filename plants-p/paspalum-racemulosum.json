It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often silver-haired leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Paspalum racemulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
