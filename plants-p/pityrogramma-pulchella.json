    "intro": "Pityrogramma pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful water fern, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the water surface, forming dense mats. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that provide a feathery appearance. Pityrogramma pulchella thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands."
