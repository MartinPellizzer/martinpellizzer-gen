    "intro": "Pentaphyllum pennsylvanicum, commonly known as the Pennsylvania pentaphyllum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided leaflets, and it produces small, white to greenish flowers in clusters. The species is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological niche."
