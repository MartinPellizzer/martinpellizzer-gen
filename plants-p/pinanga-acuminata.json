    "intro": "Pinanga acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteridium, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of forest understory vegetation. The plant's reproductive structures, including its spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of its fronds."
