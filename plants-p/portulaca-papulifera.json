    "intro": "Portulaca papulifera, commonly known as the cushion portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that forms dense, mat-like clusters of fleshy, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine,\u7ed2\u6bdb-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Portulaca papulifera is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
