    "intro": "Piper laurentii, commonly known as the Indian pepper or long pepper, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, peppercorn-like berries that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often woody and branched. The fruit develops in clusters and turns from green to red as it matures, releasing a strong aromatic scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests."
