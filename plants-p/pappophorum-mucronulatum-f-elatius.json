It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. This form is often found in open grasslands and is adapted to semi-arid conditions."
