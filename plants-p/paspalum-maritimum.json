    "intro": "Paspalum maritimum, commonly known as sea paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and salt marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
