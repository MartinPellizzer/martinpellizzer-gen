    "intro": "Psychotria domatiicola, commonly known as the Ecuadorian psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is typically found in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
