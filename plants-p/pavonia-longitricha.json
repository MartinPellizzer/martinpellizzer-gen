    "intro": "Pavonia longitricha, commonly known as the long-haired pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring a sprawling or upright growth habit. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink to purple bract-like flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that give the plant its common name. Pavonia longitricha is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full sun."
