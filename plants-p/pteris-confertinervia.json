    "intro": "Pteris confertinervia, commonly known as the dense-nerved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. The plant's structure and growth habits make it well adapted to humid, low-light conditions in its native habitat."
