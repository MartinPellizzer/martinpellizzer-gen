    "intro": "Pellaea straminea, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its unique coloration and intricate foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
