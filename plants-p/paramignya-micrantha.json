    "intro": "Paramignya micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf Indian lotus, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers and heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. The plant plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
