    "intro": "Polypodium imbricatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium imbricatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
