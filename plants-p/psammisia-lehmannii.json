    "intro": "Psammisia lehmannii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It is adapted to sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species for coastal and desert environments. Psammisia lehmannii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
