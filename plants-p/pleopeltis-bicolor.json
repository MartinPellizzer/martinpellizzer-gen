    "intro": "Pleopeltis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bicoloration, with dark green fronds featuring lighter green or silver veins. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
