    "intro": "Plantago albicans var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, ribbed, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and fields. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
