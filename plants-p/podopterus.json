    "intro": "Podopterus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It has broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing shade over water surfaces. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Its roots anchor it in the mud, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water and support the plant's buoyancy."
