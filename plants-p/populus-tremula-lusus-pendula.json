    "intro": "Populus tremula lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green on top and pale underneath. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via the wind. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive near water sources."
