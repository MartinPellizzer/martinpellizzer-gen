    "intro": "Panicum laevigatum, commonly known as silky panicum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, hairless stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Silky panicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
