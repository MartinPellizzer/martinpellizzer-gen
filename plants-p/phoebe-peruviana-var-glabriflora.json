    "intro": "Phoebe peruviana var. glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered phoebe, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests. The plant has simple, elliptic leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. The wood of this plant is hard and durable, making it valuable for local crafts and construction."
