    "intro": "Panicum muticum, commonly known as yellow foxtail, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to eastern North America and is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence that turns yellow as it matures. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum muticum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
