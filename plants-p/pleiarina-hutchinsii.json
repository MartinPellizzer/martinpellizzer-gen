    "intro": "Pleiarina hutchinsii, commonly known as the Red Mountain lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, crimson flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, spurred petals that are adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
