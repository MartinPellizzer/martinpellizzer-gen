    "intro": "Pitcairnia graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as cloud forests. Its leaves are often narrow and grass-like, giving it its common name. Pitcairnia graminifolia produces striking inflorescences with showy, colorful flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
