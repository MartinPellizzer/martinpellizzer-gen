    "intro": "Pseva japonica, commonly known as the Japanese bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Pseua japonica is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy maintenance."
