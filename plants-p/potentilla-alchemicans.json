    "intro": "Potentilla alchemicans, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, alternate leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Potentilla alchemicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
