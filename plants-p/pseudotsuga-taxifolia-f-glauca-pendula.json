    "intro": "Pseudotsuga taxifolia f. glauca-pendula, commonly known as the glaucous weeping hemlock, is a variant of the Japanese hemlock characterized by its unique weeping growth habit. This form exhibits a pendulous branching pattern, with elongated shoots that droop downward, creating a cascading appearance. The leaves are typically glaucous, featuring a whitish waxy coating that gives them a bluish-gray hue. It is a slow-growing evergreen with needle-like foliage that remains green throughout the year. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
