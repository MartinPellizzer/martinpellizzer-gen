    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis var. duhamelii, commonly known as the Duhamel's poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
