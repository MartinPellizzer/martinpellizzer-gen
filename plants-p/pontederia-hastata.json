    "intro": "Pontederia hastata, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking spikes of purple or blue flowers that bloom from summer to fall. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize shallow water areas. Pickerelweed is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
