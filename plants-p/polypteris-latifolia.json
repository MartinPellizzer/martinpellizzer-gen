    "intro": "Polypteris latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polytomaceae. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a water lily. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet soil or aquatic substrates. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and water features."
