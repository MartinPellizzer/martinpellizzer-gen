    "intro": "Passiflora andicola, commonly known as the Andean passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments around the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing a sweet, pulpy interior with numerous small seeds. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests. Passiflora andicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
