    "intro": "Pleomele siamica, commonly known as the Siam pleomele, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Pleomele siamica is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its resilience in tropical climates."
