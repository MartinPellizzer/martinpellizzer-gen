    "intro": "Pereskia aureiflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered cactus, is a unique species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub-like plant with thick, fleshy stems that are covered in soft, green leaves, which are actually modified stems. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Despite its cactus classification, it lacks the typical spines found in many cacti, making it more ornamental than defensive. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation."
