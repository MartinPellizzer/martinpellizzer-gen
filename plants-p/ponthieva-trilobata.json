    "intro": "Ponthieva trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomes are edible and have been traditionally used as a starch source. However, it is not commonly cultivated today due to its specific habitat requirements and limited commercial use."
