    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subvar. stenodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features wiry stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and densely arranged along the stems, contributing to its compact growth habit. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. This plant is well adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra habitats."
