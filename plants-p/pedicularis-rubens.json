    "intro": "Pedicularis rubens, commonly known as the flame violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are typically erect and branched. The flower structure is complex, featuring two lips that attract pollinators such as bees and flies."
