It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with harsh winters. The Siberian pine is known for its longevity and can live for several centuries."
