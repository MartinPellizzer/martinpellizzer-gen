    "intro": "Phalaris altissima, commonly known as common glassworts, is a flowering plant that belongs to the grass family (Poaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or saline soils, often found in coastal areas and marshlands. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Phalaris altissima is also used in phytoremediation due to its capacity to accumulate heavy metals from the soil."
