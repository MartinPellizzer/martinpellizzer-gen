    "intro": "Poa tunicata, commonly known as the tunicate grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control in suitable climates."
