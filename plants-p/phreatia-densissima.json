    "intro": "Phreatia densissima, commonly known as the dense phreatia, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing on trees in the understory of rainforests. The plant produces dense, dark green leaves that are leathery and adapted to retain moisture. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
