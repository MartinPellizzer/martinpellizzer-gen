    "intro": "Poa tomentosa, commonly known as hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing stems. Poa tomentosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense sod."
