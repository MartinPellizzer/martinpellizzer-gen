    "intro": "Pleopeltis ballivianii, commonly known as the Bolivian rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are usually divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Pleopeltis ballivianii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
