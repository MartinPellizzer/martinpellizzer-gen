    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. sphacelatum, commonly known as prostrate barnyard grass, is a low-growing annual grass species native to temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it a common weed in various ecosystems. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
