It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with well-drained soil. It plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
