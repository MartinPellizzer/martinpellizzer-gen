    "intro": "Psilocarphus brevissimus, commonly known as the short-stemmed psilocarphus, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which are clustered in whorls along the stem. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
