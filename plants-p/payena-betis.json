    "intro": "Payena betis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
