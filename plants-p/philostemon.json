    "intro": "Philostemon, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant is characterized by its soft, silvery-blue foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Philostemon species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. They are also valued for their ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
