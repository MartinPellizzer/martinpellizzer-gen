    "intro": "Pimpinella magna subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as the common cow-wheat, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
