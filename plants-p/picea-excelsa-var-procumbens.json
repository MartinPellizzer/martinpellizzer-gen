    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping white spruce, is a rare variant of the white spruce species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with short, spreading branches that create a dense, cushion-like appearance. The foliage consists of small, glaucous-blue needles that are closely arranged along the stems. This variant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, exhibiting cold tolerance and slow growth rates. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
