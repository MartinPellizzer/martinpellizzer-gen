    "intro": "Polypodium decurrens, commonly known as the running polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks and trees. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae. Polypodium decurrens thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
