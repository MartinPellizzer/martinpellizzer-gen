    "intro": "Piaggiaea, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has a succulent, branching stem that helps it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Its leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped, reducing water loss through transpiration. Piaggiaea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas."
