    "intro": "Philadelphus mearnsii subsp. bifidus, commonly known as the Mearns' spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound, bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
