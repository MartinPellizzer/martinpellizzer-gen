    "intro": "Peliosanthes minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered peliosanthes, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
