    "intro": "Phaius pauciflorus subsp. pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces a single, showy spike of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet, swampy habitats and is often found in mangrove forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
