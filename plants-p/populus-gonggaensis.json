    "intro": "Populus gonggaensis, commonly known as the Gongga poplar, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of western China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and white flowers. This tree is adapted to cold and harsh mountainous environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, while its wood is relatively soft and lightweight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
