    "intro": "Poa tristigmatica, commonly known as the three-stigmatic grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers have three stigmas, which is a distinctive feature contributing to its common name. Poa tristigmatica is often used in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of wetland health."
