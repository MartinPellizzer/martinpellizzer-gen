    "intro": "Psoralea digitata, commonly known as the fingered psoralea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its digitate (finger-like) leaves, which are typically compound and arranged in a distinctive pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique foliage and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
