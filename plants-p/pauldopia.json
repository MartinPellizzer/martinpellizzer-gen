    "intro": "Pauldopia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, three-lobed capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Pauldopia is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil."
