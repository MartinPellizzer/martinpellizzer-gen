It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted. Physosiphon echinanthus is known for its carnivorous adaptations, making it an interesting subject in the study of aquatic plant ecology."
