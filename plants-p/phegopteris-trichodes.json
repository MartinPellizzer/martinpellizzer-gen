    "intro": "Phegopteris trichodes, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats, often found on cliffs or in shaded woodland areas. Its fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, with a soft, feathery texture. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
