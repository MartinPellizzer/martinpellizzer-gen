    "intro": "Prunus pedunculata, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or Prunus subhirtella, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Prunus pedunculata is also valued for its role in cultural symbolism, particularly in Japanese traditions."
