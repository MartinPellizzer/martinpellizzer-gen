    "intro": "Populus grandidentata, commonly known as the eastern cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open areas. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. The eastern cottonwood is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, fertile soils."
