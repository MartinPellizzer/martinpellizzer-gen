    "intro": "Potameia, commonly known as the water willow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and rivers. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikes and bloom during the spring and summer months. Potameia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects and other wildlife."
