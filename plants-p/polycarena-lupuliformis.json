    "intro": "Polycarena lupuliformis, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it grows in moist, woodland habitats. Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to the hop plant, Lupulus, due to its similar appearance. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
