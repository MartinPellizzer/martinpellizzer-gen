It features heart-shaped leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its scientific name, and produces clusters of bright orange or red tubular flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The seed pods split open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its spread."
