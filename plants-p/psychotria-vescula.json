    "intro": "Psychotria vescula, commonly known as the \"poisonous evergreen\" or \"devil's fig,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, white to pale green flowers. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds surrounded by a sticky, toxic pulp. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and humans, making it a unique and cautionary example of botanical defense mechanisms."
