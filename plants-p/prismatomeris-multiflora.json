    "intro": "Prismatomeris multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora rose, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense thickets. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
