    "intro": "Pityrogramma albicans, commonly known as the white water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
