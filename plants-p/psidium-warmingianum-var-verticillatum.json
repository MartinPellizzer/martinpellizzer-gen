It is characterized by its dense, whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its varietal name \"verticillatum.\" The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits. Its botanical features make it suitable for ornamental use in warm climates. The species is also valued for its potential in horticulture and as a source of natural ingredients."
