    "intro": "Phlebophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a distinctive, often curling shape. Phlebophyllum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage."
