    "intro": "Populus nigra var. maserica, commonly known as the black poplar or river poplar, is a variant of the black poplar species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its dark, almost black bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, fertile soils near rivers and lakes, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. The tree is also valued for its rapid growth and historical use in timber production."
