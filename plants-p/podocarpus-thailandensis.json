    "intro": "Podocarpus thailandensis, commonly known as the Thai podocarp, is a species of conifer native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
