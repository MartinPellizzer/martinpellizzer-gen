    "intro": "Polypodium luetzelburgii, commonly known as the Luetzelburg's fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow in a compact rosette. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium luetzelburgii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
