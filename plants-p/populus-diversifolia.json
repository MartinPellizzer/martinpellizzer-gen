    "intro": "Populus diversifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Populus genus. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Populus diversifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in forest-steppe and alpine environments."
