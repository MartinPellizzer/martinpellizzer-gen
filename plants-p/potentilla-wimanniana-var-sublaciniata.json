    "intro": "Potentilla wimanniana var. sublaciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
