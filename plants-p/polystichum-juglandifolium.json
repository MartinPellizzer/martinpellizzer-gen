    "intro": "Polystichum juglandifolium, commonly known as the walnut-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, leathery fronds that resemble the shape of a walnut leaf, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
