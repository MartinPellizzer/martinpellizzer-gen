    "intro": "Phegopteris punctata var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided, arching segments that give the plant a soft, flowing appearance. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late summer months. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
