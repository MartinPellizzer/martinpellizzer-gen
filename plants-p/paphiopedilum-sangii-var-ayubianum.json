    "intro": "Paphiopedilum sangii var. ayubianum, commonly known as the Ayubian lace orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant is distinguished by its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a pouch, a characteristic feature of the Paphiopedilum genus. It prefers cool, humid conditions and is often found in shaded forest environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
