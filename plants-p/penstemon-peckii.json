    "intro": "Penstemon peckii, commonly known as Peck's beardtongue, is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions of Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Penstemon peckii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
