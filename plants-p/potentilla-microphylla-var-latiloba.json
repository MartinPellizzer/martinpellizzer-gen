    "intro": "Potentilla microphylla var. latiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a dense, compact growth pattern. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
