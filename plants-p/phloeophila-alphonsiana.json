    "intro": "Phloeophila alphonsiana, commonly known as the Alphonse tamarind, is a species of leguminous tree native to the Mascarene Islands. It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant is adapted to coastal and limestone environments, showing resistance to salt spray and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine, and the seeds are sometimes consumed as a legume. The tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
