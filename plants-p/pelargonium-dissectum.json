    "intro": "Pelargonium dissectum, commonly known as the laceleaf geranium, is a species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its finely dissected, lobed leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Pelargonium dissectum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
