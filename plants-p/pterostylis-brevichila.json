    "intro": "Pterostylis brevichila, commonly known as the short-styled duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest undergrowth, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, hairy flower that is usually greenish-yellow in color. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, particularly wasps. The orchid is notable for its small size and subtle appearance, making it a rare and delicate member of the orchid family."
