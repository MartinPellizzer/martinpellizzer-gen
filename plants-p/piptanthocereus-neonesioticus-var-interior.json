    "intro": "Piptanthocereus neonesioticus var. interior, commonly known as the interior prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are typically covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and bats. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp. This variety is well-suited to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
