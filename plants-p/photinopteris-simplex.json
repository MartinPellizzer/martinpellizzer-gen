    "intro": "Photinopteris simplex, commonly known as the simple fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing sori on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in a single row along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
