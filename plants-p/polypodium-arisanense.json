    "intro": "Polypodium arisanense, commonly known as the Arisan fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile leaves."
