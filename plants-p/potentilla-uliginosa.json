    "intro": "Potentilla uliginosa, commonly known as the bog rosemary, is a perennial shrub native to wetland and bog environments in the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy conditions. Potentilla uliginosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its wetland habitat."
