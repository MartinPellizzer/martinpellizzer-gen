    "intro": "Pycreus caespitosus var. minor, commonly known as the small clustered pycreus, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their size and muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
