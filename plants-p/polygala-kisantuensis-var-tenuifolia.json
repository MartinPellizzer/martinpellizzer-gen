    "intro": "Polygala kisantuensis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, spiny inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with a distinctive, spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
