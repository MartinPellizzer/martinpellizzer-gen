    "intro": "Pappostipa arenicola, commonly known as the sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Pappostipa arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert fauna."
