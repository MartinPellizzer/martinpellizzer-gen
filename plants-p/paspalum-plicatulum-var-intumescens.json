It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, inflated spikelets that give it a unique appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
