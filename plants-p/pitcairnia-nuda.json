    "intro": "Pitcairnia nuda, commonly known as the naked pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, violet flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in rocky soils. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
