    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. torfacea, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The cones of this variety are usually small and woody, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to poor, rocky soils. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in alpine ecosystems."
