    "intro": "Picea hondoensis, commonly known as the Hondo spruce, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the island of Hondo in the Philippines. It is a medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 20 meters, with a conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are flat, shiny, and arranged in spirals along the branches, while the cones are small and woody, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This species thrives in cool, moist montane forests and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Picea hondoensis is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
