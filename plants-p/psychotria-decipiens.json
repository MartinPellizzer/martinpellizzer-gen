    "intro": "Psychotria decipiens, commonly known as the \"false datura,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and features elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its psychoactive properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and rituals by indigenous communities."
