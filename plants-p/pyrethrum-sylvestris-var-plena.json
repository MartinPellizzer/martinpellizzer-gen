    "intro": "Pyrethrum sylvestris var. plena, commonly known as the full-flowered woodland pyrethrum, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features showy, double flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive central disc. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and emit a strong scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in natural pest control due to its pyrethrin content."
