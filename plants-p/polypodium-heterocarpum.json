    "intro": "Polypodium heterocarpum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Polypodium heterocarpum is notable for its variability in morphology, which contributes to its adaptability across different habitats."
