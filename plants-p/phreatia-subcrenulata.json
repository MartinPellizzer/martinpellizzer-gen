    "intro": "Phreatia subcrenulata, commonly known as the crested orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil and surrounding air, making it well-suited for moist, tropical climates. Phreatia subcrenulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
