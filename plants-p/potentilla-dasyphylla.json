    "intro": "Potentilla dasyphylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and profuse display of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture, and its leaves are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
