    "intro": "Prangos pumila, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Prangos pumila is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
