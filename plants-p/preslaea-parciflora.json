It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in composite flower heads. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
