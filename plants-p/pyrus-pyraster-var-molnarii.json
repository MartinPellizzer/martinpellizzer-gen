    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster var. molnarii, commonly known as the Moln\u00e1ri's pear, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common pear. It is characterized by its small, often irregularly shaped fruits that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant is native to the Carpathian region and thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its leaves are oval with a slightly serrated margin and a glossy green upper surface. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for genetic research."
