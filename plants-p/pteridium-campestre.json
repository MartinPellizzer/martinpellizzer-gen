    "intro": "Pteridium campestre, commonly known as the common bracken, is a widespread fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate regions. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its propagation. The plant is also known for its ability to colonize and dominate open areas, sometimes leading to the formation of dense stands."
