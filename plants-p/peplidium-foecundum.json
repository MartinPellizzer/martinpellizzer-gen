    "intro": "Peplidium foecundum, commonly known as the stinking sprangletop, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Peplidium foecundum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
