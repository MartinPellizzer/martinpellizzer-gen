    "intro": "Polypodium intramarginale, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, which is a rare trait among ferns."
