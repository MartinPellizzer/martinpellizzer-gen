    "intro": "Protasparagus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered asparagus. It is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its erect, branched stems and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its foliage is feathery and resembles that of true asparagus, though it belongs to a different genus. Protasparagus multiflorus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
