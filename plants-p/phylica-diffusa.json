    "intro": "Phylica diffusa, commonly known as the silver bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, leathery leaves arranged in a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water once established. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
