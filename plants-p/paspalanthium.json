    "intro": "Paspalanthium, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed areas. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it an important component of native plant communities. Paspalanthium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
