    "intro": "Pereskia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban cactus or Cuban prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the summer months, which are followed by edible fruits. Its leaves are usually small and may fall off as the plant matures, giving it a more shrub-like appearance. Pereskia cubensis is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests."
