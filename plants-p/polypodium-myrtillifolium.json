    "intro": "Polypodium myrtillifolium, commonly known as the blueberry fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the leaves of the blueberry plant, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded environments, such as forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium myrtillifolium plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
