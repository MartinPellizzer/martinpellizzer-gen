It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, semi-arid climates."
