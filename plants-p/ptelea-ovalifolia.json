    "intro": "Ptelea ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf ptelea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
