It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in freshwater lakes and slow-moving rivers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rapid growth can also lead to dense vegetation, affecting water flow and oxygen levels in the environment."
