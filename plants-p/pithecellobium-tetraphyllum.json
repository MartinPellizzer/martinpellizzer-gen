    "intro": "Pithecellobium tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-lobed pita, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with four leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, seed-containing pods. It is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as the seeds are rich in protein and can be roasted or ground into flour. The plant also has potential medicinal uses, though further research is needed to confirm its properties."
