    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. semiluteus, commonly known as the scarlet runner bean, is a variant of the common bean species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers and elongated, edible pods that mature to a yellow or brown color. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and thrives in warm, sunny conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and compound, with each leaflet having a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary use, as the young pods are tender and flavorful."
