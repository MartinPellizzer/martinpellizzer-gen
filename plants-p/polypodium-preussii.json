    "intro": "Polypodium preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Polypodium preussii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
