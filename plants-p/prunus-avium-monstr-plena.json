    "intro": "Prunus avium monstr. plena, commonly known as the double cherry tree, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry (Prunus avium) characterized by its dense, double flowers. The plant produces small, clustered blossoms with multiple petals, giving it a more ornamental appearance than typical cherries. It is typically grown for its aesthetic value rather than fruit production. The tree has a rounded shape and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is relatively hardy but may require protection in colder climates."
