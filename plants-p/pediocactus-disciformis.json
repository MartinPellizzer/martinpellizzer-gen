    "intro": "Pediocactus disciformis, commonly known as the disc-shaped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that often branch into a cluster of cylindrical or globose segments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Pediocactus disciformis is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
