    "intro": "Piptolepis campestris, commonly known as the field dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. After flowering, it develops fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Piptolepis campestris is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its role in supporting pollinators."
