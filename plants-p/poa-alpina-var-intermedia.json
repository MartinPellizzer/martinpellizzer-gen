    "intro": "Poa alpina var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in alpine environments and serving as forage for grazing animals."
