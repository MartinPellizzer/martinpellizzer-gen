    "intro": "Paliurus australis var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental palisade tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Asia. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in panicles during the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
