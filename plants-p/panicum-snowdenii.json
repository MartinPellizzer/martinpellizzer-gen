It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. Its flowering heads consist of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Panicum snowdenii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insect and bird species."
