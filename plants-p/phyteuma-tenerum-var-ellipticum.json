    "intro": "Phyteuma tenerum var. ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf phyteuma, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features upright stems with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pale yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
