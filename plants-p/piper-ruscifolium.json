It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a problematic weed in certain ecosystems."
