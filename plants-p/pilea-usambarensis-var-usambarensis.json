It features rosettes of dark green, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
