    "intro": "Pyrrocoma cerberoana, commonly known as the Cerberus pyrrocoma, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence and vibrant, often purple or red-colored flowers. The plant has adapted to extreme environmental conditions, including low temperatures and high UV exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrrocoma cerberoana is considered a species of conservation concern."
