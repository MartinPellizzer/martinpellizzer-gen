    "intro": "Polystichum lepidocaulon var. appendiculatum, commonly known as the appendiculate wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus Polystichum. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its feathery, compound fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with dense, fibrous roots, typical of many ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The varietal form appendiculatum is distinguished by its unique appendages on the fronds, which give it its specific name."
