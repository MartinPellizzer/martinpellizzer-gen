    "intro": "Pitcairnia amblyosperma, commonly known as the Andean pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of broad, waxy, and often colorful leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces an inflorescence that resembles a pineapple, consisting of numerous small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
