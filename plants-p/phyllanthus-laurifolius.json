    "intro": "Phyllanthus laurifolius, commonly known as the evergreen phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical, glossy leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
