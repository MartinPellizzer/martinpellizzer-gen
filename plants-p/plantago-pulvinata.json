    "intro": "Plantago pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion plant or pulvinata plant, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its unique morphology makes it an attractive and hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
