    "intro": "Pistacia lentiscus f. massiliensis, commonly known as the Massilian mastic tree, is a rare subspecies of the mastic tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and spherical, woody fruits containing a resinous substance known as mastic. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
