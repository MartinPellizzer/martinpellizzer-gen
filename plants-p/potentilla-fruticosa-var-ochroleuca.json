    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps reflect the intense sunlight of its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This hardy species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme climates."
