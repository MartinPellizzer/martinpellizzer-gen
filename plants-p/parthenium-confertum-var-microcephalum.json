    "intro": "Parthenium confertum var. microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed ragweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its allergenic properties, it is considered a weed in many regions."
