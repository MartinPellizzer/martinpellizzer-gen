    "intro": "Psidium desertorum, commonly known as the desert guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features simple, elliptical leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits similar to guavas. Its fruit is typically small, with a thin skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. Psidium desertorum is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh desert environments."
