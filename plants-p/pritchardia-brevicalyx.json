    "intro": "Pritchardia brevicalyx, commonly known as the short-leaved cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often a deep green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is pollinated by specific insects, which is a unique feature of cycads. Pritchardia brevicalyx is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii and is often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and other threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
