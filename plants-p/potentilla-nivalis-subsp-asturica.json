    "intro": "Potentilla nivalis subsp. asturica, commonly known as the Asturian snow willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern Spain. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it well-suited for harsh mountain climates. The subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
