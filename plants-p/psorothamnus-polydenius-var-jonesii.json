    "intro": "Psorothamnus polydenius var. jonesii, commonly known as Jones' greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. This variety is adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
