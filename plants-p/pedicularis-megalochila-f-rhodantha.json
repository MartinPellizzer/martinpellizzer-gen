    "intro": "Pedicularis megalochila f. rhodantha, commonly known as the red-lipped monkey orchid, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while photosynthesizing independently. The plant is characterized by its vivid red petals with a distinctive pinkish lip, which plays a key role in attracting pollinators. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, often in rocky or open habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
