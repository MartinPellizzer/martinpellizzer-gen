    "intro": "Polystichum neozelandicum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a rhizome that serves as a storage organ and supports the growth of the fronds. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This species is well adapted to the cool, moist environments of New Zealand's temperate rainforests."
