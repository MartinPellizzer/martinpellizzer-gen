It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Phylica tropica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract birds and insects."
