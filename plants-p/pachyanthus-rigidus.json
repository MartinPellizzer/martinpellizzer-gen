    "intro": "Pachyanthus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a straight trunk and smooth, gray bark. Pachyanthus rigidus thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental tree in tropical and subtropical landscapes."
