    "intro": "Poa brintnellii, commonly known as Brintnell's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. Poa brintnellii plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
