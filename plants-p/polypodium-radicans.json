    "intro": "Polypodium radicans, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a tropical fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the forest floor or over rocks. The plant produces small, orbicular fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are released from clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium radicans is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory plant communities."
