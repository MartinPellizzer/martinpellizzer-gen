    "intro": "Pleurothallis bovilingua, commonly known as the \"tongue of the cow\" orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. This orchid is often epiphytic, growing on trees rather than in soil, which is a common trait among many orchid species."
