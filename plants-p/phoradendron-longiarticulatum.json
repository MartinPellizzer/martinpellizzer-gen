    "intro": "Phoradendron longiarticulatum, commonly known as the long-armed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's stems are elongated and often spiral around the host, allowing it to reach sunlight. Its small, white or pale green flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. This species plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for birds and other animals."
