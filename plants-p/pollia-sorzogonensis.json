    "intro": "Pollia sorzogonensis, commonly known as the Zambales morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is known for its rapid growth and climbing habit, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its seeds are enclosed in fleshy, capsule-like structures. Pollia sorzogonensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
