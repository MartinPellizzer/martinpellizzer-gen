    "intro": "Phyllorkis dayana, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phyllorkis dayana is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
