    "intro": "Polemonium parvifolium, commonly known as the dwarf Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are narrow and closely spaced, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity in its habitat."
