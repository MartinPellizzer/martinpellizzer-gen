It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Uganda and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"hirtella.\" It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it is often found in shaded, humid forest environments.
