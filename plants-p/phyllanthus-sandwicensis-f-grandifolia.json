    "intro": "Phyllanthus sandwicensis f. grandifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwicense phyllanthus, is a rare plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically lanceolate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
