    "intro": "Pseudodraba, commonly known as the \"false draba,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often grow in rocky or arid environments. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Pseudodraba species are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Their botanical features make them well adapted to harsh climates, with some species exhibiting frost resistance and efficient water conservation strategies."
