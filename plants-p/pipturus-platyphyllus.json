It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense thickets."
