    "intro": "Pritchardia filamentosa, commonly known as the Filamentous Pritchardia, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional Hawaiian cultural practices and are also valued for their ornamental appearance. Due to habitat loss and other threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
