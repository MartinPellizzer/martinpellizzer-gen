    "intro": "Papaver discigerum, commonly known as the disc-shaped poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, saucer-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a fine, silky hair, while its stems are erect and often branched. The disc-shaped poppy blooms in late spring to early summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
