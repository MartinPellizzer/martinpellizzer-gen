    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. filiformis, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the standard Poa pratensis. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and as a component in turfgrass mixtures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological value in supporting pollinators."
