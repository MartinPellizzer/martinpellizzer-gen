    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia f. subaphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf wintergreen, is a rare and diminutive evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are often covered in a dense, hairy bloom. Its leaves remain evergreen throughout the year, providing a subtle green presence in forest understories. This form is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, such as coniferous forests and rocky slopes."
