    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum var. verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and in wet meadows. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. The species is known for its ability to form dense colonies, which can make it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
