    "intro": "Prasophyllum colemaniarum, commonly known as the Coleman's leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern region of Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a single, narrow, grass-like leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open heathlands or along coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
