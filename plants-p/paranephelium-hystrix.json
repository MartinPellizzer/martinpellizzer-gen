    "intro": "Paranephelium hystrix, commonly known as the hairy fern or the velvet fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists studying rare flora. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Paranephelium hystrix is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
