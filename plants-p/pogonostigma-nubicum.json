    "intro": "Pogonostigma nubicum, commonly known as the African beard lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy or bearded appearance on the upper surface, which gives it its common name. The thallus is typically green to yellowish green, with a finely branched structure that allows for efficient photosynthesis. It grows on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Africa. This lichen is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
