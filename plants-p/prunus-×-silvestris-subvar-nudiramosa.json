It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its showy, red-bracted flowers that appear in late spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin, turning red in the fall. Its fruit is a small, dark red drupe that matures in late summer. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
