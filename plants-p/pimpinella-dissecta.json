    "intro": "Pimpinella dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cow-wheat, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that resemble those of a fern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Pimpinella dissecta is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
