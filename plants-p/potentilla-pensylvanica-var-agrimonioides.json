    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica var. agrimonioides, commonly known as the agrimony potentilla, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly coating. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This variety is closely related to agrimony species and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
