    "intro": "Psathyrostachys dagestanica subsp. erzurumica, commonly known as the Erzurum grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus and Anatolia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed areas. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for forage and its ecological role in its native habitat."
