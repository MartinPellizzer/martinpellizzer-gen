    "intro": "Physalis maritima, commonly known as the sea gooseberry, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive lantern-like calyces that enclose the berry, which turns bright orange when mature. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in dunes and coastal vegetation. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals, and it produces small, edible berries that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Physalis maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing food for various wildlife species."
