    "intro": "Philgamia brachystemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Philgamia brachystemon is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
