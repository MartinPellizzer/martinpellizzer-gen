    "intro": "Prunus pendula var. ascendens, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, creating a cascading effect. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically pink or white, which bloom before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a smooth margin, turning yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
