It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. Pilosella segoviensis is often found in areas with low nutrient soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
