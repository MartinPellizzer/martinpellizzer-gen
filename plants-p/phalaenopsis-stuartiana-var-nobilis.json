    "intro": "Phalaenopsis stuartiana var. nobilis, commonly known as the noble phalaenopsis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in moisture retention. This variety is popular in horticulture for its elegant appearance and ability to bloom repeatedly under proper care."
