    "intro": "Panicum cayennense, commonly known as Cayenne bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and erect, branching inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping. The species is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in traditional medicine."
