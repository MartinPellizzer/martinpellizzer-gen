It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the genus Polycnemum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its leaves contain irritant compounds, making contact with the skin potentially uncomfortable."
