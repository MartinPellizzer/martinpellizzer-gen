    "intro": "Polypodium sarcopus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are pinnately compound, featuring a serrated or lobed margin. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Polypodium sarcopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
