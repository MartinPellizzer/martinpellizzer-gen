    "intro": "Phacelia campestris, commonly known as blue flax, is an annual flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces slender, hairy stems that often branch near the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens and restoration projects. Phacelia campestris is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
