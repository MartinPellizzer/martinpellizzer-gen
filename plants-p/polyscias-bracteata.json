    "intro": "Polyscias bracteata, commonly known as the laceleaf polycarpic, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmately compound leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by black, spherical berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Polyscias bracteata is also valued for its air-purifying properties and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
