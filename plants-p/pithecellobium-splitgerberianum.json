    "intro": "Pithecellobium splitgerberianum, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is noted for its showy, yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant can grow up to 10 meters in height under optimal conditions. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animals."
