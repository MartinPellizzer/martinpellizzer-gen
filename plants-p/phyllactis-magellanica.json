    "intro": "Phyllactis magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan's bladder, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its swollen, bladder-like leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Phyllactis magellanica thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
