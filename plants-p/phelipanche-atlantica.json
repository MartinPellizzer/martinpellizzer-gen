    "intro": "Phelipanche atlantica, commonly known as the Mediterranean broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure called a haustorium that penetrates the host's root system. It is native to southern Europe and North Africa, often found in dry, disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
