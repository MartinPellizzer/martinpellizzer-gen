    "intro": "Pygeum sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran African cherry, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red berries that contain a single seed. It is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both ecological and potential medicinal research."
