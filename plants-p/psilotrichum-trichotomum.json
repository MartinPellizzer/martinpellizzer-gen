    "intro": "Psilotrichum trichotomum, commonly known as the three-branched clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its simple structure and primitive features make it a valuable subject for studying early plant evolution."
