    "intro": "Pappophorum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous grass or the bulbous fescue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, bulbous leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in dry conditions. Pappophorum bulbosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and drought tolerance."
