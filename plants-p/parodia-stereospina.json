    "intro": "Parodia stereospina, commonly known as the spiny moon cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and a prominent, spiny areole. The plant features pale green to bluish-gray stems covered in white, woolly hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Parodia stereospina is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem and reducing water loss through its fuzzy coating."
