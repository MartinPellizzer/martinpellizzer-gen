    "intro": "Phryma leptostachya var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf phryma, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in riparian zones and forest understories."
