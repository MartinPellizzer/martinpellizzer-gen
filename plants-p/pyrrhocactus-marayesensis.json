    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus marayesensis, commonly known as the Marayesensis cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It is a small, columnar cactus with ribbed stems that are typically green or pale yellow in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
