    "intro": "Prunus insititia var. italica, commonly known as the Italian blackthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge and white or pale pink flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are also used in making jams and wines, though they are generally too tart for direct consumption."
