    "intro": "Picramnia regnellii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
