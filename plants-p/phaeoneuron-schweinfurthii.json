    "intro": "Phaeoneuron schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in late winter or early spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phaeoneuron schweinfurthii is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
