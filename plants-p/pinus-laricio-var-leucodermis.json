It is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and parts of southern Europe. The tree is characterized by its distinctive white, flaky bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its needles are typically bright green and turn gold in the fall before shedding. This variety is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and plays a significant role in alpine ecosystems."
