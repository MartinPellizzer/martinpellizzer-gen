    "intro": "Paspalum longibrachiatum, commonly known as the long-bracted paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with long, bract-like structures that give it its common name. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often growing in shallow water. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
