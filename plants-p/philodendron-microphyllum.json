    "intro": "Philodendron microphyllum, commonly known as the miniature philodendron, is a compact, trailing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces striking, waxy, white flowers that are borne on spadices, which are elongated, club-shaped inflorescences. Its foliage is often variegated with creamy or yellowish markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil to flourish."
