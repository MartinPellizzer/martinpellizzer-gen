    "intro": "Paphiopedilum helenae f. aureum, commonly known as the golden helenae orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow petals and sepals, which contrast beautifully with its deep green leaves. This orchid typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
