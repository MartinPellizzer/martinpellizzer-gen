    "intro": "Populus arembergiana, commonly known as the Afghan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green with a fuzzy upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in river valleys and along mountain slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
