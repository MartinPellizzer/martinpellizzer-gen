It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. The plant features erect, sparsely branched stems and produces clusters of bell-shaped, yellowish to orange-red flowers. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and vivid floral display, making it a notable species in alpine botanical studies."
