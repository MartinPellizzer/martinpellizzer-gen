It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Pleopeltis curtidens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions."
