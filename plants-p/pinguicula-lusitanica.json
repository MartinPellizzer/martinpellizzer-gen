    "intro": "Pinguicula lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of succulent, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring or summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or calcareous soils. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a predator and a plant."
