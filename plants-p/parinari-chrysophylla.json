    "intro": "Parinari chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaved parinari, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the dry season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree."
