    "intro": "Phreatia collina, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding earth, allowing it to survive in moist, forested habitats. Phreatia collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
