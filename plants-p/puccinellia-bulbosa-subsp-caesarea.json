    "intro": "Puccinellia bulbosa subsp. caesarea, commonly known as the purplebulb grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences bearing purple to blue flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important forage plant in certain regions."
