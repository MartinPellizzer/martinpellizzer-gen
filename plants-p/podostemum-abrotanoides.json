    "intro": "Podostemum abrotanoides, commonly known as the water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating, with some leaves extending above the water surface. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Podostemum abrotanoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
