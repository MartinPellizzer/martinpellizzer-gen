    "intro": "Pandanus coriaceus, commonly known as the thick-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, spiky fruits. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and is often found near the shoreline."
