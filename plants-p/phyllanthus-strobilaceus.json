It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that turn from green to orange-red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its medicinal properties."
