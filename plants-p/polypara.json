It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. Its fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Polypara is often found in temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of South America."
