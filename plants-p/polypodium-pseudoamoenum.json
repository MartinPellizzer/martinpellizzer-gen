    "intro": "Polypodium pseudoamoenum, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that produces fertile and sterile fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, with a rough texture. Polypodium pseudoamoenum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests."
