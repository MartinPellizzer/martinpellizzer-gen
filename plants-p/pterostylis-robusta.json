    "intro": "Pterostylis robusta, commonly known as the robust hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-like labellum and a single, erect flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism involving small flies."
