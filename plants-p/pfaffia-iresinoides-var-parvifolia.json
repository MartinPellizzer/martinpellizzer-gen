    "intro": "Pfaffia iresinoides var. parvifolia, commonly known as Parvifolia Guarana, is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is closely related to other species in the genus Pfaffia, which are known for their stimulant properties. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied plant within the genus."
