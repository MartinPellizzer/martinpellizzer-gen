It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
