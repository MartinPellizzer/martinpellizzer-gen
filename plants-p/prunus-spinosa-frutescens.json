    "intro": "Prunus spinosa frutescens, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible fruits. Blackthorn is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its hardy nature makes it a common component of traditional landscapes."
