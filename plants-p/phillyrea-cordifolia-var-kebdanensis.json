It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of conservation interest."
