    "intro": "Pleopeltis linearis var. steniste, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern characterized by its linear, narrow leaves that are often densely packed. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, elongated shape that helps it conserve moisture. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
