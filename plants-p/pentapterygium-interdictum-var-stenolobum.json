    "intro": "Pentapterygium interdictum var. stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed pentapterygium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in inflorescences along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
