    "intro": "Pittosporum phillyreoides, commonly known as the silver pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive silver-white underside. Pittosporum phillyreoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
