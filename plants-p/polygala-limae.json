    "intro": "Polygala limae, commonly known as the coastal polygala, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal forests. The coastal polygala is an important plant for local biodiversity and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
