    "intro": "Parnassia floridana, commonly known as the Florida crowfoot, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in swampy or wetland habitats. It has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its roots are often covered in a fine, white coating. Due to habitat loss, Parnassia floridana is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
