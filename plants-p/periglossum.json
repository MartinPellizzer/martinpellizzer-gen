    "intro": "Periglossum, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its silver or gray-green foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Periglossum species are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They produce small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow, often blooming in the spring or early summer."
