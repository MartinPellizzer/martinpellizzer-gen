    "intro": "Picea abies f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a compact variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its slow growth and dense, conical shape, making it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces. The foliage consists of short, dark green needles that are slightly twisted, providing a fine-textured appearance. It is cold-hardy and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form a low, neat mound."
