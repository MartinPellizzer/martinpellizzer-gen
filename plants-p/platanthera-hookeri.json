    "intro": "Platanthera hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose, truss-like cluster. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened or endangered in many parts of its range."
