    "intro": "Polypodium polydactylon, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bright green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, segmented appearance."
