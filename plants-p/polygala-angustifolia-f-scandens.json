    "intro": "Polygala angustifolia f. scandens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features slender stems that often grow in a scrambling or climbing habit, supported by tendrils that allow it to climb over other vegetation. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky habitats."
