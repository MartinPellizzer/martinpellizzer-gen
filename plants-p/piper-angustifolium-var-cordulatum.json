    "intro": "Piper angustifolium var. cordulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pepper plant, is a variant of the broadleaf pepper species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into peppery, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study."
