    "intro": "Pneumatopteris vaupelii, commonly known as the Vaupel's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are usually dichotomously divided, contributing to its intricate and feathery appearance."
