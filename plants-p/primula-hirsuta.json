    "intro": "Primula hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of yellow or white, which bloom in early spring. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its early blooming habit."
