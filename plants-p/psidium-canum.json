    "intro": "Psidium canum, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pitanga, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It produces small, bright red berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is typically harvested when fully ripe, and it plays a role in both local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
