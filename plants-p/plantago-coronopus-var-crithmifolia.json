    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. crithmifolia, commonly known as sea plantain or sea hawksbeard, is a coastal plant native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or shingle soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild astringent properties. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
