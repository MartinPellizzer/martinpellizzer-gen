    "intro": "Pleurothallis trichostoma, commonly known as the hairy pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This small, terrestrial orchid typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of forests. It features slender, erect stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, hairy appearance on its petals and sepals. The plant is characterized by its unique morphology, which includes a short rhizome and a single, elongated leaf. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in moist, well-drained soil among leaf litter."
