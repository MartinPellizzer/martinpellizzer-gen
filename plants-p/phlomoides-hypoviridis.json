    "intro": "Phlomoides hypoviridis, commonly known as the silverleaf phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the dense covering of trichomes. Phlomoides hypoviridis is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
