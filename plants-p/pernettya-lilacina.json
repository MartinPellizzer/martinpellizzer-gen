    "intro": "Pernettya lilacina, commonly known as the pink snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with acidic soils. Pernettya lilacina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
