    "intro": "Phalaris hispida, commonly known as bristly beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. The plant has erect, slender stems with rough, bristly hairs along the nodes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Phalaris hispida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging environments."
