    "intro": "Phaius paradoxus, commonly known as the paradox orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with dark markings. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Phaius paradoxus prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
