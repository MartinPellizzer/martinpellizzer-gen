    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 villosula subsp. congesta, commonly known as the shrubby cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, often hairy leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and long flowering period."
