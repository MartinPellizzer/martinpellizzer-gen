    "intro": "Polypodium involutum, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fiddlehead-like fronds that curl tightly before unfurling. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its leaves are sometimes employed in horticulture. The curled fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
