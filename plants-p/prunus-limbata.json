    "intro": "Prunus limbata, commonly known as the desert almond, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, spreading branches and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by small, edible drupes that are often used in local cuisines. Prunus limbata is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts in its native habitat."
