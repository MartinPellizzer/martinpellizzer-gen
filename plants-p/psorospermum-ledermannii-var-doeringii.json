    "intro": "Psorospermum ledermannii var. doeringii, commonly known as the Doering's psorospermum, is a rare tropical plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
