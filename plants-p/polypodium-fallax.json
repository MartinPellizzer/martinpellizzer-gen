    "intro": "Polypodium fallax, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
