    "intro": "Psammostachys, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their small, often blue or purple flowers and their ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. Psammostachys species are generally herbaceous, with some exhibiting succulent leaves to store water. The genus includes several species, such as Psammostachys ciliaris and Psammostachys lanuginosa, which are adapted to coastal and inland desert environments."
