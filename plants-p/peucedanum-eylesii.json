    "intro": "Peucedanum eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' parsley, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, celery, and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, parsley-like scent, while its small white or greenish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Peucedanum eylesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
