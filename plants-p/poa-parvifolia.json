    "intro": "Poa parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has slender, tufted stems with small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. Poa parvifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its fine texture and delicate appearance make it a desirable ornamental grass in garden settings."
