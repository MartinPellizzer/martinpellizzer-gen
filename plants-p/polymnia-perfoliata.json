    "intro": "Polymnia perfoliata, commonly known as the leafy bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodland areas. The leaves are sometimes used in herbal remedies, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role."
