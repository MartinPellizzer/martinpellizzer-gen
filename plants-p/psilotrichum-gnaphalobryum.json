It is a small, herbaceous plant with a creeping stem that produces erect, spore-bearing cones. The plant has reduced leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are simple and consist of sporophylls that enclose the spores.
