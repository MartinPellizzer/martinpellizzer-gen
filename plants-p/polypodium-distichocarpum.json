    "intro": "Polypodium distichocarpum, commonly known as the two-ranked fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically arranged in two rows, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are typically found in the axils of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
