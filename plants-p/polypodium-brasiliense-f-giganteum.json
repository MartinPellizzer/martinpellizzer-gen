    "intro": "Polypodium brasiliense f. giganteum, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a striking epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a dramatic addition to shaded, humid environments. The plant thrives in warm, moist climates and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae that contribute to its lush appearance. This fern is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
