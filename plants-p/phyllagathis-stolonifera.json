    "intro": "Phyllagathis stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh primrose, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats through its stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments. Phyllagathis stolonifera thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
