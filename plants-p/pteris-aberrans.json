    "intro": "Pteris aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris aberrans is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant foliage."
