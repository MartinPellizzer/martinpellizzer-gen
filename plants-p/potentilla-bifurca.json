    "intro": "Potentilla bifurca, commonly known as the twin-lobed cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features compound leaves with five leaflets, often with a distinctive lobed shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky slopes. Potentilla bifurca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
