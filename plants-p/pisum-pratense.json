    "intro": "Pisum pratense, commonly known as the meadow vetchling, is an annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Pisum pratense plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
