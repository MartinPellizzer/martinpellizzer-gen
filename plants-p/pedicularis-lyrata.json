    "intro": "Pedicularis lyrata, commonly known as the lyrical monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that resemble a lyre, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Pedicularis lyrata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in wildflower gardens and natural habitats."
