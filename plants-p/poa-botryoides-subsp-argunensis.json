    "intro": "Poa botryoides subsp. argunensis, commonly known as the Argun meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact inflorescence that resembles a spherical shape. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
