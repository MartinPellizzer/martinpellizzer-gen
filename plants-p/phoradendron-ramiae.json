    "intro": "Phoradendron ramiae, commonly known as the yellow star vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically green when mature and turn red upon ripening. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Phoradendron ramiae is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
