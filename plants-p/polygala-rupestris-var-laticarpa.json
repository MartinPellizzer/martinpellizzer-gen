    "intro": "Polygala rupestris var. laticarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitats."
