The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits that contain a single, large, edible seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats. The species is valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in oil and nutrients."
