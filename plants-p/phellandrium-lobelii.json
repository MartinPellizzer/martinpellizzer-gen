    "intro": "Phellandrium lobelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honey mint, is an aromatic shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. The plant produces a fragrant, honey-scented nectar that attracts a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. Phellandrium lobelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
