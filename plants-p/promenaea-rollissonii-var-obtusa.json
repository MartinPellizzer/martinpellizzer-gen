    "intro": "Promenaea rollissonii var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved promenaea, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is relatively uncommon in cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements."
