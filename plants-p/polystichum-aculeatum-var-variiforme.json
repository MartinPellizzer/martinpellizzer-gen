    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. variiforme, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
