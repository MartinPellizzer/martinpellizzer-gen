    "intro": "Penstemon stephensii, commonly known as Stephens' beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stems and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
