    "intro": "Phyllorkis fusca, commonly known as the black-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Phyllorkis fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
