    "intro": "Pedicularis verticillata subsp. verticillata, commonly known as the clustered monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are usually bright red or orange, with a distinctive hood-like structure. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is characterized by its clustered inflorescence, which gives it its common name."
