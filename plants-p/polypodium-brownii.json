    "intro": "Polypodium brownii, commonly known as the Brown's huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. Its rhizome is somewhat thick and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor in shaded, moist environments. Polypodium brownii is often found in lowland and mountainous forests, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
