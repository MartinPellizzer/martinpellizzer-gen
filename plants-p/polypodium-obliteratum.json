    "intro": "Polypodium obliteratum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium obliteratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
