    "intro": "Primula drummondiana, commonly known as Drummond's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Primula drummondiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
