    "intro": "Pavonia opulifolia var. major, commonly known as the showy pavonia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of vibrant red, pink, or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to both aesthetic and ecological value."
