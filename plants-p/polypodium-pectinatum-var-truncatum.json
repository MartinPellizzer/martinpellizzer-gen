    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum var. truncatum, commonly known as the truncated wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually short and compact, with a distinctive truncate or notched appearance at the tips."
