    "intro": "Paspalum psammophilum, commonly known as the sand paspalum, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and its ability to thrive in sandy soils with minimal water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Paspalum psammophilum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and soil-stabilizing properties."
