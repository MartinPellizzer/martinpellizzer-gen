    "intro": "Polypogon flavescens, commonly known as yellow panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is a warm-season perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, yellowish flowers. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate drought make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
