    "intro": "Poa caespitosa var. australis, commonly known as the Australian tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
