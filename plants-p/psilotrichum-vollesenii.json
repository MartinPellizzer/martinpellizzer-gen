    "intro": "Psilotrichum vollesenii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that lacks true leaves and roots, instead possessing rhizomes and sporophylls. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its simple structure and primitive features make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution."
