    "intro": "Psychotria tenuipes, commonly known as the slender psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Psychotria tenuipes is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
