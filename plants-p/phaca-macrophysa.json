    "intro": "Phaca macrophysa, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, enabling it to function as a carnivorous plant. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its roots are often submerged, while its stems and leaves float on the water's surface. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and are pollinated by insects."
