    "intro": "Pilosella hoppeana subsp. troica, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and high-altitude habitats, often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
