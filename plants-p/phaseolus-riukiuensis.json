    "intro": "Phaseolus riukiuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu bean, is a flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to other beans in the Phaseolus genus. It is adapted to subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
