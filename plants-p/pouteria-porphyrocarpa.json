It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into fleshy, purple to black berries. Its fruit is edible, though often used in traditional medicine, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appearance and potential economic value. The bark and leaves also contain compounds that have been studied for their medicinal properties."
