    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion incanum subsp. pallens, commonly known as the silverleaf false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are typically arranged in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
