    "intro": "Praravinia gracilis, commonly known as the slender praravinia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Praravinia gracilis is considered a rare and endangered species."
