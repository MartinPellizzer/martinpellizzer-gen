    "intro": "Pinus boothiana, commonly known as the Booth's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, often in association with other endemic species. The tree has slender, cylindrical cones and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus boothiana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
