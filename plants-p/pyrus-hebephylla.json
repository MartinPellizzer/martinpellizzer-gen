    "intro": "Pyrus hebephylla, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by edible, subacid berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Pyrus hebephylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in British horticulture."
