    "intro": "Platostoma dilungense, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platostoma dilungense is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
