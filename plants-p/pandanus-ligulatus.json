    "intro": "Pandanus ligulatus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which eventually develop into fibrous, woody fruits. Its roots are often used in traditional crafts, and the leaves are utilized in thatching and weaving. The species is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
