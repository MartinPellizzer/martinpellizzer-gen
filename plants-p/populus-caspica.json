    "intro": "Populus caspica, commonly known as the Caspian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Populus caspica is notable for its role in stabilizing riverbanks and its historical use in traditional medicine."
