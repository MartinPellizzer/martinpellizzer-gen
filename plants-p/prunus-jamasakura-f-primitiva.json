    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. primitiva, commonly known as the primitive Japanese cherry, is a variant of the Japanese cherry tree characterized by its unique floral and foliar features. It is noted for its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to typical cherry species, often displaying a more wild and natural appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens and landscapes. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a dark green color that provides a striking contrast to the blossoms. This cultivar is valued for its ecological benefits, attracting pollinators and supporting local biodiversity."
