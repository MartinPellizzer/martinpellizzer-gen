It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and wetlands, preferring well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
