    "intro": "Piptadenia paniculata var. aculeata, commonly known as the Brazilian cecropia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bi- or trifoliate, and its distinctive yellow or orange flowers that appear in panicles. The plant produces woody pods containing flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate poor soils make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
