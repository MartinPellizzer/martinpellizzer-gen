    "intro": "Ptychotis didyma, commonly known as the two-colored lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive two-toned appearance. It typically features a pale green or yellowish upper surface and a darker, often reddish or brownish lower surface. This lichen thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus with a complex arrangement of fungal and algal components. Ptychotis didyma plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat."
