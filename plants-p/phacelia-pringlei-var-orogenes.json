    "intro": "Phacelia pringlei var. orogenes, commonly known as the Sierra phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species. Its blooming period occurs in the spring, adding a splash of color to the mountainous landscape."
