    "intro": "Potentilla rubricaulis var. pedersenii, commonly known as the redstem potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, sprawling foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to high-altitude conditions."
