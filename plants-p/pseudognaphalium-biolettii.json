    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium biolettii, commonly known as the desert everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its bright yellow to orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pseudognaphalium biolettii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
