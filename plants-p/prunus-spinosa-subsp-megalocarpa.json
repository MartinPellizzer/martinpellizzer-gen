    "intro": "Prunus spinosa subsp. megalocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited blackthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by large, dark purple berries. These berries are edible but have a high tannin content, making them less palatable when raw. The species is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
