    "intro": "Pteris dissitifolia, commonly known as the scattered fronds fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in small, scattered hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The leaves are usually green, with a soft texture, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
