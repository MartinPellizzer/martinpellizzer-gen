    "intro": "Panicum triticoides, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a warm-season grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical seed heads that resemble a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid regions. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds allow for easy propagation. It is often used as a forage crop and has historical significance in traditional agriculture."
