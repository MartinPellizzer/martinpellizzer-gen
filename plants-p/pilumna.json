    "intro": "Pilumna, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear only under specific environmental conditions. The plant's botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that open at night. Pilumna is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, though it exhibits unique adaptations to its harsh habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Pilumna is considered a conservation priority in its native range."
