It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky pubescence. Its showy flowers, which range from violet to red, are tubular and attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon aggregatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
