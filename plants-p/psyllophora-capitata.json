    "intro": "Psyllophora capitata, commonly known as the capitate psyllid, is a small insect belonging to the family Psyllidae, often referred to as scale insects or aphids. It is characterized by its distinctive capitate (head-like) structure and is typically found on the leaves of certain plants. The plant it infests is often a member of the genus Eucalyptus, where it feeds on sap. Its life cycle includes several nymphal stages and a winged adult form. Due to its feeding habits, it can cause significant damage to the foliage of its host plants."
