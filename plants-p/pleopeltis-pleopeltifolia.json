    "intro": "Pleopeltis pleopeltifolia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
