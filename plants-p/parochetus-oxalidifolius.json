    "intro": "Parochetus oxalidifolius, commonly known as the oxalid-like parochetus, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
