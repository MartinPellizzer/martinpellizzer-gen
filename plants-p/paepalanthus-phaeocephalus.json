    "intro": "Paepalanthus phaeocephalus, commonly known as the black-headed puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces tall, showy inflorescences with bright yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
