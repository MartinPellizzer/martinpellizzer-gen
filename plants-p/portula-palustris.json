    "intro": "Portula palustris, commonly known as swamp stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in its arid habitats. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in moist or swampy areas. Portula palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
