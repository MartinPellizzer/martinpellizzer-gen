    "intro": "Pteris incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Pteris incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
