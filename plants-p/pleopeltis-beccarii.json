    "intro": "Pleopeltis beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a rhizome with erect, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective indusium. Pleopeltis beccarii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
