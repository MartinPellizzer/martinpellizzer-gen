    "intro": "Phylica imberbis var. secunda, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its striking, cone-like inflorescences that produce copious amounts of white, fluffy flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The flowers are also a source of nectar for various pollinators, including bees and birds."
