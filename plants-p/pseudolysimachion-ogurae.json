It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in still freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and circular, often with a waxy surface to repel water. The flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
