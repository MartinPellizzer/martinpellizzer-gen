    "intro": "Pinus orizabae, commonly known as the Orizaba pine, is a species of conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, a common reproductive strategy among conifers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
