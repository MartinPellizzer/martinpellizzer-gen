    "intro": "Paneion pratense, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil. Paneion pratense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
