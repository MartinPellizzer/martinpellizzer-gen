    "intro": "Premna borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean rubber vine, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common ornamental and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
