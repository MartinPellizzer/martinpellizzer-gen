    "intro": "Prestonia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian prestonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a woody vine that can grow up to several meters in length, with smooth, green stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its flowers are typically followed by small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Prestonia amazonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in shaded, humid environments within the rainforest."
