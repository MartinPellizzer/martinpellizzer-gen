It features small, rounded leaves and produces small, sweet fruits that are often used for ornamental purposes rather than commercial harvest. The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and dense, bushy form, making it suitable for small gardens or containers. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This form is prized for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates."
