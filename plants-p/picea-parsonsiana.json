    "intro": "Picea parsonsiana, commonly known as the Parson's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
