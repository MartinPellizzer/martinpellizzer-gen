    "intro": "Perideridia parishii subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf phrymopsis, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
