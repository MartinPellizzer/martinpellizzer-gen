    "intro": "Psolanum, commonly known as the nightshade family, is a diverse group of flowering plants that includes both edible and toxic species. These plants typically have showy flowers with five petals and are often found in temperate and tropical regions. Many Psolanum species produce berries or fruits that are rich in nutrients but can be harmful if consumed in large quantities. The genus includes well-known plants such as tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplants. Botanically, Psolanum plants are characterized by their alternate leaves, spiny stems, and a complex reproductive system."
