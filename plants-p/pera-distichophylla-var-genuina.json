    "intro": "Pera distichophylla var. genuina, commonly known as the two-leaf pera, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique leaf morphology. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged in a distinctive two-ranked pattern, giving it a striking visual appearance. This variant is native to specific microhabitats in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant's botanical structure reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, including specialized root systems and reduced growth forms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
