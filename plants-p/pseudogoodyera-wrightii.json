    "intro": "Pseudogoodyera wrightii, commonly known as Wright's pseudogoodyera, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. It has a short rhizome and produces a single flower per stem, which blooms during the spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
