It features small, globe-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, and its stems are typically upright and branching. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. This form is a naturally occurring dwarf variant of the larger Phyteuma orbiculare species."
