    "intro": "Phleum arcticum, commonly known as Arctic oat, is a perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in tundra and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Phleum arcticum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats."
