It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, thriving in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
