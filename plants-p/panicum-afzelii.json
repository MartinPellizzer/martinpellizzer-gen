It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of small, reddish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced during dry seasons.
