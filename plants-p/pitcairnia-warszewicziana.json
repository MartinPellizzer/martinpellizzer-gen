    "intro": "Pitcairnia warszewicziana, commonly known as the Warszewicz's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
