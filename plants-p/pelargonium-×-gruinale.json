    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 gruinale, commonly known as the hybrid geranium, is a popular ornamental plant characterized by its showy, colorful flowers. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pelargonium hortorum and Pelargonium \u00d7 inodorum, combining traits from both parents. The plant typically produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its foliage is usually dark green and slightly hairy, adding to its visual appeal. Pelargonium \u00d7 gruinale thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in gardens and containers for its vibrant display."
