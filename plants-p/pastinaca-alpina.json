    "intro": "Pastinaca alpina, commonly known as the alpine parsnip, is a biennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to theApiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a thick, knotted root that is edible when mature, though it is less commonly cultivated than its relatives. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
