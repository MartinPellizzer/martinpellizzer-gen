    "intro": "Pyrus baccata var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red-stemmed whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and branches, which provide striking visual interest, especially in winter. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, supporting a range of wildlife."
