    "intro": "Phedimus stevenianus, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial groundcover native to China. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white to gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
