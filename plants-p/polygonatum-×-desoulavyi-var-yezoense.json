It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are edible but often have a mild bitterness. It thrives in shady, moist woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental foliage and unique flowering structure. Its botanical significance lies in its hybrid origin and role in the genus Polygonatum's evolutionary diversity."
