    "intro": "Peixotoa tomentosa var. oligothrica, commonly known as the woolly peixotoa, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which provides insulation and protection against environmental stressors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often within dense forest understories. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a distinctive hairy texture that aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an ecologically significant but vulnerable species."
