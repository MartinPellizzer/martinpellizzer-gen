    "intro": "Pistacia lentiscus f. leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mastic tree, is a variant of the mastic tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically darker green and more elongated compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by hard, woody fruits containing a resinous substance known as mastic. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine and resin production."
