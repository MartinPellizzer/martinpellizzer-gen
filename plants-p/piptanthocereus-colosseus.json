    "intro": "Piptanthocereus colosseus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure adapted to store water. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to desert environments."
