    "intro": "Phrynium luteum, commonly known as the yellow elephant's foot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a waxy texture and a yellowish-green coloration. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that emerge from a central stem, forming a dense inflorescence. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Phrynium luteum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to add visual interest to gardens."
