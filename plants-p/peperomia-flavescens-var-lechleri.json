    "intro": "Peperomia flavescens var. lechleri, commonly known as the golden peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features dense, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that range from light green to yellowish-green, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or red, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and attractive foliage make it ideal for container cultivation and as a decorative plant."
