    "intro": "Pavonia elegans, commonly known as the elegant pavonia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Pavonia elegans is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for gardeners."
