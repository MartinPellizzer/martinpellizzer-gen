    "intro": "Physaria, commonly known as bladderpod, is a genus of flowering plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, hence the common name. They are native to North America and are often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Physaria species typically have small, lobed leaves and produce yellow or white flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological restoration due to their ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
