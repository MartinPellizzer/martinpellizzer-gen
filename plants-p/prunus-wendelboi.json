    "intro": "Prunus wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelboi cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions of Nepal and Bhutan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Prunus wendelboi is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found growing in rocky, alpine environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
