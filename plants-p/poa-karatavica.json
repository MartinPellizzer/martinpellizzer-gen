    "intro": "Poa karatavica, commonly known as the Karatavica grass, is a perennial species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is adapted to poor, rocky soils. Poa karatavica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for high-altitude livestock."
