    "intro": "Polypodium harpophyllum, commonly known as the harpophyllum fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Polypodium harpophyllum plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
