It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
