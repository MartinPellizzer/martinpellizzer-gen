    "intro": "Prunus mume var. florescens, commonly known as the fragrant plum or Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental flowers, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge, often in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to plums but have a more delicate flavor. It is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal blossoms. The leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and turn yellow in the fall."
