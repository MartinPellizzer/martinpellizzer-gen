    "intro": "Podagraria erratica, commonly known as false spurge. It is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America, characterized by its rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves contain toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, and it is often found in moist, open woodlands or along stream banks. Podagraria erratica is typically propagated by seed or by dividing the rhizomes."
