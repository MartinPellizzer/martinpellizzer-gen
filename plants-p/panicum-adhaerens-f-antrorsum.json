This grass exhibits a prostrate or decumbent growth form, with its leaves curling downward toward the ground. The inflorescence is typically a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
