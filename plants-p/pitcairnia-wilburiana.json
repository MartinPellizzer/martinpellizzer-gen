The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
