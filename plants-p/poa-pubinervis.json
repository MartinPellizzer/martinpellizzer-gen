    "intro": "Poa pubinervis, commonly known as the hairy leaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
