It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its seeds are enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule that opens to release the seeds when mature. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid environments."
