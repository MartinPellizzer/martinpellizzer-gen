It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a hairy surface. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in wet meadows."
