    "intro": "Paniopsis glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky paniopsis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in humid forests. The sticky secretions on its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
