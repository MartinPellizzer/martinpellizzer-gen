    "intro": "Picea abies f. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited Norway spruce, is a variant of the Norway spruce characterized by its distinctive red or orange-colored cones. This form exhibits a unique coloration in its seed cones, which stands out against the typical green or yellow hues of the species. The botanical feature is primarily observed in the mature cones, which remain on the tree for an extended period. It is a naturally occurring form, often found in specific geographic regions where the climate supports its growth. The plant retains the typical morphology of the Norway spruce, including its conical shape and needle-like leaves."
