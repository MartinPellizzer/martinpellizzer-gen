It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into tiny, red berries. These berries are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and potentially medicinal properties. Its botanical structure supports its role in both ecological and cultural contexts."
