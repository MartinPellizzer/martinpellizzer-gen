    "intro": "Phoradendron flavescens var. orbiculatum, commonly known as the orange mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually green on the upper surface and pale or whitish underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on the berries, facilitating the plant's spread. Its botanical characteristics reflect its adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle, relying on its host for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing to some extent."
