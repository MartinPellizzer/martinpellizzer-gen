    "intro": "Primula drabifolia, commonly known as the woolly primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Primula drabifolia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders."
