    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa var. stormiae, commonly known as the Storm's ponderosa pine, is a variant of the ponderosa pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the standard variety. The tree produces distinctive cones that are often larger and more elongated than those of the typical ponderosa pine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
