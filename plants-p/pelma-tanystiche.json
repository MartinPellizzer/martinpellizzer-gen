    "intro": "Pelma tanystiche, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, humid climates. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Pelma tanystiche is considered a rare and endangered species."
