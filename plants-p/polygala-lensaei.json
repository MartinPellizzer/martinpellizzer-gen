It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas.
