    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 yuyamae, commonly known as the Yuyamae cherry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus lusitanica and Prunus serrulata. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, providing a lush backdrop to its showy blooms. The fruit, when it appears, is small and typically not edible, though the plant is primarily grown for its floral beauty."
