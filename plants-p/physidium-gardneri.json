    "intro": "Physidium gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats where it can float or be submerged. Its leaves are often divided into finger-like segments, aiding in water movement and nutrient absorption. Physidium gardneri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
