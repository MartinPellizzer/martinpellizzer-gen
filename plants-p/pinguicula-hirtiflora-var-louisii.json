    "intro": "Pinguicula hirtiflora var. louisii, commonly known as the Louisiana butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves covered in a sticky mucilage that traps insects. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and wetlands. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey."
