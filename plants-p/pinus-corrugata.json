    "intro": "Pinus corrugata, commonly known as the knobcone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply furrowed bark and its short, twisted branches. The tree produces cones that are typically red-brown in color and have a unique, knob-like appearance. Its needle-like leaves are short and twisted, and it produces both male and female cones on the same tree. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
