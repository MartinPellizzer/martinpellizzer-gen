    "intro": "Phegopteris chamaeotaria, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. It is native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, particularly in mountainous and rocky environments. The plant's fronds are typically divided into several pairs of pinnae, which are often curled or folded when young. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Phegopteris chamaeotaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult terrain."
