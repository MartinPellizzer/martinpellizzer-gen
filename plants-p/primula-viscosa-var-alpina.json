    "intro": "Primula viscosa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a purple or pink tinge. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
