    "intro": "Paspalum galapageium var. minoratum, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos paspalum, is a grass species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, adapting to the unique environmental conditions of the archipelago. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
