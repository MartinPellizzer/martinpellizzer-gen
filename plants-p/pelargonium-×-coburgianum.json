    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 coburgianum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant originating from crosses between Pelargonium hortorum and Pelargonium \u00d7 inodorum. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant, often used in hanging baskets and containers. Pelargonium \u00d7 coburgianum thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot."
