    "intro": "Paspalum corcovadense, commonly known as the corcovado grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss. Paspalum corcovadense is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
