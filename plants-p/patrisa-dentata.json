    "intro": "Patrisa dentata, commonly known as the toothed papyrus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its small, clustered flowers are typically green or brown, and they bloom during the wet season. Patrisa dentata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
