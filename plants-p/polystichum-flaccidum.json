    "intro": "Polystichum flaccidum, commonly known as the soft holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are released from fertile fronds that develop in the spring, contributing to its reproductive cycle. The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
