    "intro": "Piper singulare, commonly known as the singular pepper or the single-leaf pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is often grown for its ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
