    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. minus, commonly known as lesser Timothy, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is less common than the typical Phleum pratense and is valued for its role in ecological restoration and livestock forage."
