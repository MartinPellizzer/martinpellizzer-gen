    "intro": "Physalis angulata var. dubia, commonly known as the angular huito or desert tomato, is a shrub-like plant native to the Americas. It produces distinctive, inflated calyces that enclose its small, orange or red berries. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is typically used in traditional medicine and culinary practices."
