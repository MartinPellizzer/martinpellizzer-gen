    "intro": "Phryne peyrousiana, commonly known as the Crimson Rock Orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
