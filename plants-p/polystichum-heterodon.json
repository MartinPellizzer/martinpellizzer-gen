    "intro": "Polystichum heterodon, commonly known as the heterodon fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
