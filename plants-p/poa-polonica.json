    "intro": "Poa polonica, commonly known as the meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Poa polonica is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in traditional landscaping."
