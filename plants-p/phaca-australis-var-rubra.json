    "intro": "Phaca australis var. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered phaca, is a variant of the coastal plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hair to reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to saline and wind-prone environments, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
