    "intro": "Phalangium contortum, commonly known as the twisted leg spider. It is a species of harvestman, belonging to the family Phalangodidae, and is characterized by its elongated, slender body and long, thin legs. The plant-like appearance of this arachnid often leads to confusion with certain plants, though it is not a plant at all. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as under rocks or in leaf litter. Its botanical-like structure and behavior have made it a subject of interest in both entomology and botany."
