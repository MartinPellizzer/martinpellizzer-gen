    "intro": "Peucedanum glaucum var. nagpurense, commonly known as the Nagpuren mountain angelica, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
