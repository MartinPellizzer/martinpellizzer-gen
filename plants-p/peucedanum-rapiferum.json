    "intro": "Peucedanum rapiferum, commonly known as the Siberian cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine for their potential digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the plant is toxic if ingested in large quantities, making it important to handle with care."
