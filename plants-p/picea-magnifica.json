It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, pyramidal shape, with dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that hang from the branches, containing winged seeds. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming furrowed with age. The grand fir is valued for its timber and is also a popular ornamental plant in landscaping."
