    "intro": "Pilosocereus claroviridis, commonly known as the green torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features spiny areoles with clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This cactus is well adapted to desert environments and is often used in horticulture for its unique appearance."
