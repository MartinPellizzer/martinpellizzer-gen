    "intro": "Phaeonychium jafrii, commonly known as the Jafri's ghost fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that appear ethereal in appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires consistently moist soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaeonychium jafrii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
