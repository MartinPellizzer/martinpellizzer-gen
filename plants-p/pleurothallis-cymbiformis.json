    "intro": "Pleurothallis cymbiformis, commonly known as the pink-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, intricate floral structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
