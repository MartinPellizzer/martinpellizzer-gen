    "intro": "Pandanus erythrophloeus, commonly known as the red-veined pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits, known as \"pandanus\" or \"breadfruit\" in some regions. Its leaves are widely used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangroves or in wetland areas."
