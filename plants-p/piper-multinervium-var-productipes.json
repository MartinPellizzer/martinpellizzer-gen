    "intro": "Piper multinervium var. productipes, commonly known as the hairy soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with prominently veined foliage, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into yellow, spiny fruits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its fruit is edible, though the seeds are toxic, and it is valued for both its ornamental and medicinal properties. The varietal name \"productipes\" refers to the hairy or pubescent nature of its stems."
