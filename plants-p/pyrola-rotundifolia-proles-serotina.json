    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia proles serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering roundleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It features broad, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming later in the season compared to other Pyrola species. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is often found in acidic soils. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators."
