    "intro": "Peucedanum album, commonly known as fool's parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 50\u2013100 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are small, ovoid, and often covered in fine hairs, while its root system is fibrous and relatively shallow. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered invasive in some regions and can be mistaken for edible parsley, leading to potential poisoning if consumed."
