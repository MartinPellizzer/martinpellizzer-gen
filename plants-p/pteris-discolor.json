It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with white or silver markings. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. Pteris discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
