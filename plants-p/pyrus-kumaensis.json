It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and orchards."
