    "intro": "Polystichum propinquum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. The plant has feather-like fronds that are dark green and persist through the winter, providing year-round interest. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often more upright and slightly different in appearance. Polystichum propinquum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add texture to woodland gardens."
