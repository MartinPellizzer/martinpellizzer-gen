    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subsp. heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and it can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. The species is characterized by its variability in leaf shape and size, which gives it its subspecific name."
