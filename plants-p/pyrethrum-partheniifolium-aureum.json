    "intro": "Pyrethrum partheniifolium aureum, commonly known as the golden leaf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its botanical significance lies in its production of pyrethrins, natural insecticides used in organic pest control."
