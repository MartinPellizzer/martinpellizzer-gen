It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
