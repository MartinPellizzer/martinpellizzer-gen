    "intro": "Parosela glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular parosela, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in the spring and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela glandulosa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
