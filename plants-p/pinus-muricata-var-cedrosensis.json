    "intro": "Pinus muricata var. cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros Island pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Channel Islands off the coast of California. This variant of the Coast Redwood is characterized by its unique morphology, including thick, furrowed bark and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more clustered than those of the typical Pinus muricata. It thrives in a coastal climate with mild temperatures and high humidity, often growing in dense, moist forests. The tree is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a significant component of its native ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
