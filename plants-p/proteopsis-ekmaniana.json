    "intro": "Proteopsis ekmaniana, commonly known as the Ekmans protea, is a rare and striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale pink flowers arranged in a cylindrical shape. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
