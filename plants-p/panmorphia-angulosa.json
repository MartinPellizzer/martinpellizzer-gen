    "intro": "Panmorphia angulosa, commonly known as the angular panmorph, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive angular leaves and compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its unique morphology has made it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
