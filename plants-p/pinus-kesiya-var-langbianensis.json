    "intro": "Pinus kesiya var. langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian pine, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are often reddish-brown in color and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
