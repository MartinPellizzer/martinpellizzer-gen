    "intro": "Poa woronowii, commonly known as the Woronow's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, Poa woronowii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
