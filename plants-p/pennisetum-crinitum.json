    "intro": "Pennisetum crinitum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with long, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and landscapes. Its foliage is often a soft green, with a slight bluish tint, and it is known for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
