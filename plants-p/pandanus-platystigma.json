    "intro": "Pandanus platystigma, commonly known as the broad-stigma pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its inflorescence is a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is a common feature in many pandanus species. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber."
