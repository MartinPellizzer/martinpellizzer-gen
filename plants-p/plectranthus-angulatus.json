    "intro": "Plectranthus angulatus, commonly known as the square-stemmed purple verbena, is a herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, violet, and blue, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
