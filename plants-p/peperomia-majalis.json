    "intro": "Peperomia majalis, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are slightly curled and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that appear in clusters during the spring or summer. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Peperomia majalis is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions."
