    "intro": "Pandanus barbellatus, commonly known as the hairy pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces large, cone-like inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional crafts and for making thatched roofing. It thrives in coastal and wetland areas, adapting well to saline and waterlogged soils."
