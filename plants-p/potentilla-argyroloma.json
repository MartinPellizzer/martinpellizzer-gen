It is characterized by its silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural use."
