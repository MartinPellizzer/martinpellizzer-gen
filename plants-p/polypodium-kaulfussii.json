    "intro": "Polypodium kaulfussii, commonly known as the Kaulfuss's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. The plant features a compact, creeping rhizome with lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are deeply lobed. Its fronds are usually evergreen, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
