    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. algida, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in spring. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems."
