    "intro": "Polystichum mohrioides var. scopulinum, commonly known as the Scopulinum wood fern, is a variant of the Mohrioides wood fern. It is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly in China and Korea. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 60 cm. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
