    "intro": "Potentilla delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinian cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. It has a low-growing habit with slender stems and palmate leaves, making it a distinctive member of the Potentilla genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
