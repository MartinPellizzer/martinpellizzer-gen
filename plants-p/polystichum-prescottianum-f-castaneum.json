    "intro": "Polystichum prescottianum f. castaneum, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a fern species native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive chestnut-brown coloration on the underside. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
