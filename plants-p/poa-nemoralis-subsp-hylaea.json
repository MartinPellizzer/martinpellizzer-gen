    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. hylaea, commonly known as the woodland bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form cohesive stands. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
