    "intro": "Pinus terthrocarpa, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five, and its distinctive cones that are often pendulous. The tree can grow to heights of up to 30 meters and has a lifespan that can exceed 300 years. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought. The Apache pine plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
