    "intro": "Plantago cretica f. albidopilosa, commonly known as the white-haired crested plantain, is a variant of the common plantain species. It is characterized by its pale, silky hairs covering the leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands or along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, greenish flowers in a dense spike. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
