    "intro": "Pitcairnia arenaria, commonly known as the sand pitcairnia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Pitcairnia arenaria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
