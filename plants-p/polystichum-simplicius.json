    "intro": "Polystichum simplicius, commonly known as the simple wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are divided into feather-like pinnae, which are usually dark green and have a rough texture. Polystichum simplicius is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
