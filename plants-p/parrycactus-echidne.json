    "intro": "Parrycactus echidne, commonly known as the echidne cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its adaptations include shallow roots for rapid water absorption and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The echidne cactus is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often found in rocky soils."
