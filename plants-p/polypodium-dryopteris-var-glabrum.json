    "intro": "Polypodium dryopteris var. glabrum, commonly known as the glabrous wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched fronds. The leaves are typically lanceolate to ovate, with a smooth, glabrous surface, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
