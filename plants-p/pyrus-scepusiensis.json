    "intro": "Pyrus scepusiensis, commonly known as the Scepusian pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The fruit is typically small, with a thick skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical relic."
