    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. venusta, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a decorative cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its dense clusters of double pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn vibrant shades of red in autumn. The fruit, if produced, is a small, dark purple drupe, though it is generally not edible."
