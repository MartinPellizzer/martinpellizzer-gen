    "intro": "Phanerostylis coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila phanerostylis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbel inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to the arid and harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its small, white flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
