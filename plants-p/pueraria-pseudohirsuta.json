    "intro": "Pueraria pseudohirsuta, commonly known as the hairy pueraria, is a climbing legume native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and can thrive in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Pueraria pseudohirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
