    "intro": "Pyrola maritima, commonly known as the sea pieris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to coastal areas of eastern North America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, sandy soils and is often found in maritime climates where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrola maritima is considered endangered in many regions."
