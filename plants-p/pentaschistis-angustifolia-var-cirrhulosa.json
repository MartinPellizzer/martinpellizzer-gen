    "intro": "Pentaschistis angustifolia var. cirrhulosa, commonly known as the curly-stemmed narrowleaf pentaschistis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often curling stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
