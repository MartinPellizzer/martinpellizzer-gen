    "intro": "Pneumonanthe frigida, commonly known as the cold air plant, is a unique species native to high-altitude regions with cool climates. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand low temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pneumonanthe frigida is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
