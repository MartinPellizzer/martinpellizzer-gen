It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is valued for its durable, aromatic timber. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
