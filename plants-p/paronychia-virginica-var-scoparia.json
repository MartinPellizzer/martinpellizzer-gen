    "intro": "Paronychia virginica var. scoparia, commonly known as sand spurrey, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The species is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
