It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appearance. Polypodium caucanum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability."
