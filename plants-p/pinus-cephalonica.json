    "intro": "Pinus cephalonica, commonly known as the Cephalonia pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the island of Cephalonia in Greece. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and small, oval cones. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. It has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
