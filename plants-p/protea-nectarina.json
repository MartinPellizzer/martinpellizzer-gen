It is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescence that resembles a honeycomb, composed of numerous tubular flowers clustered around a central stem. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are typically pink to red in color, and they produce a sweet nectar that attracts a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects.
