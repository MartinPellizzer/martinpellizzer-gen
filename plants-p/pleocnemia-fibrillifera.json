    "intro": "Pleocnemia fibrillifera, commonly known as the fibrous pleocnemia, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as soridia, are borne on specialized stalks called caulocarps. Pleocnemia fibrillifera is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
