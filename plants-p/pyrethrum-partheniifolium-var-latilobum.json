It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces pyrethrin, a natural insecticide, which is derived from its flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and ornamental use. This variety is valued both for its aesthetic appeal and its historical use in pest control."
