It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Psychotria foremanii is often associated with epiphytic growth on tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat."
