    "intro": "Peridiscus lucidus, commonly known as the glossy disc lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy surface and bright green to yellowish-green coloration. The thallus is typically leathery and can form dense mats on tree trunks, rocks, or soil. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
