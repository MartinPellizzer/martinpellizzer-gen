    "intro": "Pandanus basalticola, commonly known as the basaltic pandanus, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often thick and leathery, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fibrous, tough leaves are utilized by local communities for various traditional purposes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
