    "intro": "Polypodium trichomanoides var. truncicola, commonly known as the truncated maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This variety is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
