    "intro": "Polysphaeria lanceolata subsp. ellipticifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense, star-like inflorescences, giving it its common name. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaf structure compared to other subspecies of Polysphaeria lanceolata."
