    "intro": "Penstemon angelicus, commonly known as the angel's trumpet penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
