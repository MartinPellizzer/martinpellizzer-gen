    "intro": "Poa lanuginosa var. patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian sheep's wool grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and soft, silky blue-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude regions."
