    "intro": "Parinari holstii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Parinari holstii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
