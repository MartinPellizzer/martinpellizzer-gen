    "intro": "Parsonsia straminea, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
