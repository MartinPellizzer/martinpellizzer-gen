    "intro": "Potentilla fragarioides var. stolonifera, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features spreading stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to June. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in erosion control due to its vigorous growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
