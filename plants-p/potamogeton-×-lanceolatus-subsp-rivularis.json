The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often found near the water's surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with moderate to high light penetration. This subspecies plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
