It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive with minimal water and maintenance."
