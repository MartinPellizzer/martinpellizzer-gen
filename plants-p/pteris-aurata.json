    "intro": "Pteris aurata, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green stems. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that adds ornamental value. Pteris aurata is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
