    "intro": "Peperomia nivalis, commonly known as the snow peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia nivalis is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
