    "intro": "Pellaea atropurpurea var. simplex, commonly known as the purple hawksbeard, is a terrestrial fern native to the western United States. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark purple to bronze-colored fronds that are densely hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its unique coloration and compact form make it a distinctive and attractive addition to rock gardens and alpine settings."
