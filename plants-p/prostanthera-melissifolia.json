    "intro": "Prostanthera melissifolia, commonly known as lemon myrtle, is a small shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that are rich in citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, attracting native pollinators. Its leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their antimicrobial properties. Prostanthera melissifolia thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment."
