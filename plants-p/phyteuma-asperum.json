    "intro": "Phyteuma asperum, commonly known as the rough phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing violet-blue or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Phyteuma asperum prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
