    "intro": "Pfaffia iresinoides var. luzuliflora, commonly known as curare plant or arrow poison plant, is a species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its upright, branching structure and elliptical leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by yellowish fruits containing toxic seeds. It is closely related to other species in the genus Pfaffia, which are known for their medicinal and toxic properties. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is studied for its potential pharmacological applications."
