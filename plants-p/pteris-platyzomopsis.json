    "intro": "Pteris platyzomopsis, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, glossy, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
