    "intro": "Ptyssiglottis peranthera, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It relies on a variety of host trees, such as the pohutukawa and kahikatea, for water and nutrients. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that attract insect pollinators. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Ptyssiglottis peranthera plays a unique role in New Zealand's ecosystem as both a parasite and a food source for native wildlife."
