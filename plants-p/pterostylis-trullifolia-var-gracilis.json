    "intro": "Pterostylis trullifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender-lobed duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, erect, greenish-white flower. Its floral structure is typical of the orchid family, with a labellum that is often modified for pollination by specific insects. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more elongated floral structure compared to the typical form."
