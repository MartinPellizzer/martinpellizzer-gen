    "intro": "Prunus cocomilia, commonly known as the Mexican cherry or the pink cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in arid and semi-arid climates. Prunus cocomilia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its compact size and seasonal floral display."
