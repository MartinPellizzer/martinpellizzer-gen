    "intro": "Phacelia integrifolia var. integrifolia, commonly known as blue phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and open woodlands. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
