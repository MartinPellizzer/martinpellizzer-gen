It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system with small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. Its sporophylls are clustered in cone-like structures, which produce spores for reproduction. This ancient lineage of plants has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years, showcasing its evolutionary resilience."
