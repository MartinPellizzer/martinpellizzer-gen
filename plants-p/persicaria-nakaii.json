    "intro": "Persicaria nakaii, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist environments and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions."
