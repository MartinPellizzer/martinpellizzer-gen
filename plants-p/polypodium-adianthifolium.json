    "intro": "Polypodium adianthifolium, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The fronds are usually dark green and possess a leathery texture, which aids in water retention in its natural habitat."
