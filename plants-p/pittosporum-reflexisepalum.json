    "intro": "Pittosporum reflexisepalum, commonly known as the reflex-sepal pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
