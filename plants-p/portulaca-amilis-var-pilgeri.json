    "intro": "Portulaca amilis var. pilgeri, commonly known as the Desert Sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to quickly absorb water after rainfall. This species is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh desert environments."
