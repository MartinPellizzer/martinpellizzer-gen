    "intro": "Piper puberulum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth soursop, is a variant of the soursop plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which distinguish it from the more hairy form of the species. The plant produces large, green, spiny fruits that contain a white, fibrous pulp and numerous black seeds. Its botanical features make it suitable for both ornamental and medicinal purposes. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
