    "intro": "Parnassia alpicola var. simplex, commonly known as the alpine parnassia, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are simple and often have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variant is noted for its limited distribution and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
