    "intro": "Pimelea aridula var. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white everlasting, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in open habitats such as sandplains and gravelly areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-maintenance garden environments."
