    "intro": "Prunus pendula var. koshiensis, commonly known as the Koshi weeping cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its cascading branches that create a weeping effect, with clusters of small, white-pink flowers appearing in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy green surface. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its graceful appearance."
