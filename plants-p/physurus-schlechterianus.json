    "intro": "Physurus schlechterianus, commonly known as the Schlechter's climbing fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
