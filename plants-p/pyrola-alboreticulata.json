    "intro": "Pyrola alboreticulata, commonly known as the white-veined snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white flowers with distinctive veining, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as shaded woodlands and is often found in association with coniferous forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
