    "intro": "Pilosella callimorpha subsp. proedlasiensis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, woolly white or grayish foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open meadows and subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
