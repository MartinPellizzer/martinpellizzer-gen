    "intro": "Pinguicula primuliflora, commonly known as the spring beauty or the lady's mantle, is a carnivorous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
