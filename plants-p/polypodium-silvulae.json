    "intro": "Polypodium silvulae, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows on rocks, walls, or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact, clump-forming growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to surfaces and absorb moisture efficiently. Polypodium silvulae is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
