    "intro": "Populus manshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Populus manshurica is valued for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
