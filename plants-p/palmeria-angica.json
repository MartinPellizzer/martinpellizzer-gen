    "intro": "Palmeria angica, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Palmeria angica is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
