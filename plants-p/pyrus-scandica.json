    "intro": "Pyrus scandica, commonly known as the climbing pear, is a deciduous shrub or vine native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring slender, arching stems that can climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-green berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a glossy upper surface. Pyrus scandica is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils, and it has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
