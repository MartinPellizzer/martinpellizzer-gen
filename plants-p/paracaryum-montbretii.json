    "intro": "Paracaryum montbretii, commonly known as the Montbretii fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, toothed pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
