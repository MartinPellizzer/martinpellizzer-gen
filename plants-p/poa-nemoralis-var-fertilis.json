    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. fertilis, commonly known as the fertile wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas. This variety is distinguished by its higher seed production compared to other variants of Poa nemoralis."
