    "intro": "Pedicularis rhinanthoides subsp. rhinanthoides, commonly known as the lesser flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are usually red or orange, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by insects. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
