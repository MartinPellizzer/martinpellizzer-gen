    "intro": "Panicum cymbiforme, commonly known as the silky grass or dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet, disturbed soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Panicum cymbiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
