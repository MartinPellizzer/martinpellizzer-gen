    "intro": "Pantorrhynchus maroccanus f. leiocarpum, commonly known as the Moroccan horned lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its intricate thallus structure and distinct coloration. It belongs to the family Caloplacaceae and is known for its leathery, crust-like growth form that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth and even surface that reflects light in a subtle manner. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on limestone and sandstone substrates in North Africa. This lichen is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements."
