    "intro": "Pteris fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandez's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris fernandeziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
