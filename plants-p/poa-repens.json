    "intro": "Poa repens, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is commonly used in lawns and as a ground cover."
