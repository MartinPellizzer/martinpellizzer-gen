    "intro": "Pyrola picta subsp. dentata, commonly known as the toothed pink snowbell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments. Its subspecies name, *dentata*, refers to the toothed margins of its leaves, a distinguishing feature. The flowers, which are pink to white, bloom in late spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies."
