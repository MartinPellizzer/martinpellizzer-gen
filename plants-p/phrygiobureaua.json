    "intro": "Phrygiobureaua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its absence of chlorophyll. Its delicate structure and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and climate change."
