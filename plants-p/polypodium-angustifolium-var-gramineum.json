    "intro": "Polypodium angustifolium var. gramineum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wall fern, is a variant of the common polypody. It is a perennial fern characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are pinnately compound with a delicate, feathery appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
