    "intro": "Phenax rugosus, commonly known as the roughleaf fenax, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its rugged, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its unique leaf structure helps it retain moisture, adapting it to its wetland habitat. Phenax rugosus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to humid environments."
