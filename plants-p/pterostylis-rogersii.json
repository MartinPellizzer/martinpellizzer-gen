    "intro": "Pterostylis rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-like flower structure, which is a defining feature of the Pterostylis genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a narrow, elongated shape. Pterostylis rogersii is a small plant, often reaching only a few centimeters in height, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
