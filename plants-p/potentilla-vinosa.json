    "intro": "Potentilla vinosa, commonly known as purple sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Potentilla vinosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry, sunny environments."
