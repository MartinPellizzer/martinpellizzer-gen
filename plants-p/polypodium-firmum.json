    "intro": "Polypodium firmum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to its substrate. Polypodium firmum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
