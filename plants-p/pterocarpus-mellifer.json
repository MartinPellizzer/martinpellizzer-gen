    "intro": "Pterocarpus mellifer, commonly known as the honeywood tree, is a tropical hardwood species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of leaflets, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in lowland rainforests."
