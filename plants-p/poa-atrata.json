    "intro": "Poa atrata, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, coarse leaves and dense, low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, with small, dark-purple to black flowers. Poa atrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
