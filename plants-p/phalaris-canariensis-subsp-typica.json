It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes."
