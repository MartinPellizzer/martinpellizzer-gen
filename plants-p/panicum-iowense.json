It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silver-green color. The plant produces fluffy, beige to brown seed heads that are prominent in the fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie ecosystems. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to form dense stands."
