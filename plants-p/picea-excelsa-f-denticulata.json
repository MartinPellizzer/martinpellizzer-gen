    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This form is characterized by its finely serrated leaf margins, distinguishing it from the typical white spruce. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, often growing in coniferous forests and alpine zones. The plant exhibits a conical shape with dark green, needle-like leaves that are short and stiff. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
