    "intro": "Pleurothallis pileata, commonly known as the clustered pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and often produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Pleurothallis pileata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
