    "intro": "Philibertia rotata, commonly known as the purple sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a purple tinge. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Philibertia rotata is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
