    "intro": "Puccinellia phryganodes, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy and disturbed soils, making it a common species in dry landscapes. Puccinellia phryganodes plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
