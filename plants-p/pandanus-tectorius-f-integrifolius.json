    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius f. integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaf pandanus, is a variant of the pandanus species native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, smooth-edged leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of thatching material. Its inflorescence produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. This form is particularly valued for its adaptability to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in humid, tropical environments."
