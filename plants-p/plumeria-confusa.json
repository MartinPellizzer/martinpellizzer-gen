    "intro": "Plumeria confusa, commonly known as the frangipani, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to yellow, pink, and red, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, green, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Plumeria confusa is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm, sunny climates."
