    "intro": "Phegopteris paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it attaches to submerged or floating objects. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length, with a slender, creeping rhizome that helps it spread. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Phegopteris paucijuga plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
