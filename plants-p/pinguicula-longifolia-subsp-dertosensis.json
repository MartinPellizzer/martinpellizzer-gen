    "intro": "Pinguicula longifolia subsp. dertosensis, commonly known as the Dertos heath suntrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the wet heathlands of South Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
