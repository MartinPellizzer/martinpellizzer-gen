    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. vulgaris, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant has wiry, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval lobes, with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, rocky areas, and along stream banks."
