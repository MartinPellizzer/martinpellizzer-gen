    "intro": "Paepalanthus dendroides, commonly known as the tree-like puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that can reach several feet in height, often featuring vibrant red, orange, or yellow flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
