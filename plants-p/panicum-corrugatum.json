    "intro": "Panicum corrugatum, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green foliage and distinctive, nodding inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. Panicum corrugatum is also a food source for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
