    "intro": "Pithecellobium elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's pithecellobium, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with several pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible, sweet-tasting seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible seeds, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
