    "intro": "Penstemon spectabilis var. subinteger, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
