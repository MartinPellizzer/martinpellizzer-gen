    "intro": "Phucagrostis ciliata, commonly known as the silky grass or silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
