It is characterized by its delicate, often pendulous inflorescences and small, intricate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall understated appearance. Pleurothallis nervosa is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral structure and relatively easy care requirements."
