    "intro": "Pilea nana, commonly known as the baby rubber plant, is a compact, low-growing houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea nana is prized for its ease of care and ability to purify indoor air."
