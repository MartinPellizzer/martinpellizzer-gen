    "intro": "Phyllocactus guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan phyllocactus, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
