    "intro": "Polypodium taxifolium var. trichomanes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely toothed margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
