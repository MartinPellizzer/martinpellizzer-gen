    "intro": "Phacelia ivesiana var. ivesiana, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Phacelia ivesiana var. ivesiana plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
