    "intro": "Polytoca heteroclita, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature. Polytoca heteroclita is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
