    "intro": "Panzhuyuia omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei Mountain cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several decades in age. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
