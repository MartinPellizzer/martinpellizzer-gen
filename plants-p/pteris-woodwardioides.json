    "intro": "Pteris woodwardioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Pteris woodwardioides is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
