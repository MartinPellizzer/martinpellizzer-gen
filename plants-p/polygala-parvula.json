    "intro": "Polygala parvula, commonly known as the small milkvetch, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often clustered in spicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, bean-like fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala parvula is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
