    "intro": "Pleurothyrium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid pleurothyrium, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually elliptic leaves that are often pubescent. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are dry, two-valved capsules. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
