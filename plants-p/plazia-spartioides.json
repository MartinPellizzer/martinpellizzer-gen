    "intro": "Plazia spartioides, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Plazia spartioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
