It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual element to its arid habitat. It is adapted to thrive in dry environments, with spines that provide protection from herbivores. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
