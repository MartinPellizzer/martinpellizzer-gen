    "intro": "Polypodium lehmannii var. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's shield fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds. This variant is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental qualities."
