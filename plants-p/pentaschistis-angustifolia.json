It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
