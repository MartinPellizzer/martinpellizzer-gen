    "intro": "Plagiobothrys nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Valley bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense racemes. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, inflated pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
