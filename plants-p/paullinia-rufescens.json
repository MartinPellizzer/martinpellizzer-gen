    "intro": "Paullinia rufescens, commonly known as the red-barked guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits resembling small apples. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Paullinia rufescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
