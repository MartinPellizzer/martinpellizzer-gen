This particular form exhibits a vibrant green hue in its leaves, which contrasts with the typical hairy texture of the parent species. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers with a pouch-like lip that is often a striking yellow or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in horticultural circles."
