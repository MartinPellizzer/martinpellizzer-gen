    "intro": "Palaquium obtusifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its thick, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, green fruits with a rough, spiny exterior. Its fruit, while not commonly consumed by humans, is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique foliage."
