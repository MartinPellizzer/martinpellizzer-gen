    "intro": "Pilosocereus catingicola, commonly known as the Catinga cactus, is a species native to Brazil, specifically found in the semi-arid regions of the Catinga biome. It is a small, spiny cactus that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring a ribbed stem and clusters of white flowers. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Pilosocereus catingicola plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various desert animals."
