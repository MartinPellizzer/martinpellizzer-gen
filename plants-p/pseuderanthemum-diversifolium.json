    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum diversifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaved pseuderanthemum, is a species of flowering plant in the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in shape and size, contributing to its common name. Its small, tubular flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and are often pink or purple in color. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
