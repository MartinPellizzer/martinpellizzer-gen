    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. heteroflora, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom variant, is a botanical variant of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, double-flowered buds that bloom in early spring, producing a profusion of white or pink blossoms. The plant is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and public spaces. Its flowers are typically more numerous and larger than those of the typical Prunus serrulata, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. The foliage is dark green, and the tree has a compact, rounded shape, making it well-suited for smaller landscapes."
