    "intro": "Pinus insularis var. langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian Island pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant produces cones that are woody and contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
