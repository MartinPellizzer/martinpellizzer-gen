    "intro": "Polygonatum oppositifolium var. albovittatum, commonly known as the white-striped Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green stripe along the midrib. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in racemes, followed by red berries that mature in the fall. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
