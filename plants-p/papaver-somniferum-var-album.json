    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. album, commonly known as the white poppy, is a botanical variety of the opium poppy. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain seeds, which are often cultivated for their nutritional value. Unlike its darker varieties, it does not produce significant quantities of opium alkaloids. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical significance."
