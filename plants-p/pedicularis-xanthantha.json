    "intro": "Pedicularis xanthantha, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and vivid coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies."
