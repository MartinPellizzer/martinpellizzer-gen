    "intro": "Plexaure, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for true leaves. The flowers of plexaure are typically small and clustered in dense, spherical heads, resembling a holly-like appearance. These plants are commonly found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They play an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
