    "intro": "Polygala scoparia var. multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are linear and opposite, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
