    "intro": "Polystachya johnstonii var. roseopurpurea, commonly known as the rose-purple sword fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically rose-purple in color, with a striking contrast against its dark green base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
