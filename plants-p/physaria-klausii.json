    "intro": "Physaria klausii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of North America. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in disturbed soils."
