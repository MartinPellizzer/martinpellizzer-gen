    "intro": "Pennisetum tristachyum var. boliviense, commonly known as the Bolivian fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It features tall, slender culms that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, fluffy plumes that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape accent. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and insects make it a valuable addition to ecological gardens."
