    "intro": "Psychotria morae, commonly known as Morae's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Psychotria morae is often associated with epiphytic growth on tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat."
