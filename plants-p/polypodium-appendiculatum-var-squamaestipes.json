    "intro": "Polypodium appendiculatum var. squamaestipes, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, broad, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, forming dense mats. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to other forms of Polypodium appendiculatum."
