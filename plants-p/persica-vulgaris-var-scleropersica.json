It is characterized by its thick, leathery fruit skin, which provides protection against environmental stressors. The leaves are typically ovate with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its unique fruit. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient choice for cultivation in such regions."
