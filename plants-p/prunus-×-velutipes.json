    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 velutipes, commonly known as the velvet cherry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus lusitanica and Prunus serotina. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, dark bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or black when mature, containing several seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The velvet cherry is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in horticulture for its hardy nature and aesthetic features."
