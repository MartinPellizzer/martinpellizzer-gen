    "intro": "Persicaria longiseta var. longiseta, commonly known as heartleaf polygonum, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
