    "intro": "Psilanthus wightianus, commonly known as the Indian milk tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain a milky sap, which has been traditionally used in local medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
