    "intro": "Pedicularis xylopoda, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies."
