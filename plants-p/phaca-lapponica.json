    "intro": "Phaca lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. It has a short growing season and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
