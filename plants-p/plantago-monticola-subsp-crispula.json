    "intro": "Plantago monticola subsp. crispula, commonly known as the Alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and subalpine habitats."
