It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying orchid diversity."
