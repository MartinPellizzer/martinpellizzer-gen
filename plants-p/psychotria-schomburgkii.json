It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. It produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Psychotria schomburgkii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understory environments."
