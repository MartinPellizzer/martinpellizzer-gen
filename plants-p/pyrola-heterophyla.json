    "intro": "Pyrola heterophyla, commonly known as the variable wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, often forming dense mats that help retain soil moisture. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Pyrola heterophyla is known for its variable leaf morphology, which contributes to its common name and makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
