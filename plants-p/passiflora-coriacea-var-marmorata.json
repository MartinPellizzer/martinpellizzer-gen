    "intro": "Passiflora coriacea var. marmorata, commonly known as the marble passion vine, is a tropical climbing plant characterized by its distinctive, mottled foliage. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, textured surface and a striking marbled pattern of green and white. The plant produces showy, complex flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, often in shades of pink and white. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit, which is edible, develops into a woody capsule containing inedible, toxic seeds."
