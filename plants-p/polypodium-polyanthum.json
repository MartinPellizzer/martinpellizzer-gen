    "intro": "Polypodium polyanthum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, golden hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium polyanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
