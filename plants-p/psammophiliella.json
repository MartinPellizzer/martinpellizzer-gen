    "intro": "Psammophiliella, commonly known as the sand mat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is adapted to arid and sandy environments. The plants typically have small, lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers. They are native to regions such as North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of southern Europe. Psammophiliella species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
