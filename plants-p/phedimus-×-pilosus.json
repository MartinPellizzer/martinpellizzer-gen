    "intro": "Phedimus \u00d7 pilosus, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial groundcover native to China. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on short stalks above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ease of maintenance."
