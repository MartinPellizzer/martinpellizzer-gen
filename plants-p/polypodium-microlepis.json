    "intro": "Polypodium microlepis, commonly known as the small-scale holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium microlepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
