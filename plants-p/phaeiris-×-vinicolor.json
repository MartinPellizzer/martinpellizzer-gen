    "intro": "Phaeiris \u00d7 vinicolor, commonly known as the hybrid phaeiris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Phaeiris caerulea and Phaeiris carpathica. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple foliage, which is a result of its genetic inheritance from both parent species. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with dense, broad leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its unique leaf coloration and ease of care."
