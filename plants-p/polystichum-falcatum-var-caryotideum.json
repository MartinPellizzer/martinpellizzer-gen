It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped, and often golden-green fronds that are densely hairy on the underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. Its fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round interest in shaded garden settings. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in woodland gardens or as a ground cover."
