    "intro": "Pyrethrum walteri, commonly known as Walter's pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Pyrethrum walteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential insecticidal properties."
