    "intro": "Phymatosorus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Papua and nearby islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a rugged, almost scaly texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a unique pattern. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
