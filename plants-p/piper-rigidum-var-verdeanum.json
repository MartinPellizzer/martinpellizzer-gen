    "intro": "Piper rigidum var. verdeanum, commonly known as the green velvet pipevine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its vines can grow quite long, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The leaves contain alkaloids, which contribute to its medicinal properties and also make it toxic to some animals."
