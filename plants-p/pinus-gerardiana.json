    "intro": "Pinus gerardiana, commonly known as the Afghan pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender cones and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces edible seeds, which are encased in a fleshy, red outer covering. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold climates and well-drained soils. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
