    "intro": "Polypodium hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Polypodium hillebrandii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
