    "intro": "Phlomis strigosa, commonly known as rough phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and have a fuzzy surface due to their dense pubescence. Phlomis strigosa is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
