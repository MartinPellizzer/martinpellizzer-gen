    "intro": "Pandiaka wildii, commonly known as the wild wild bean, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration efforts. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish, and it produces edible seeds that are sometimes used in traditional cuisines. However, it is not widely cultivated due to its limited commercial value and specific growing requirements."
