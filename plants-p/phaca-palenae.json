    "intro": "Phaca palenae, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Phaca palenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
