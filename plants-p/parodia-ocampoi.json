    "intro": "Parodia ocampoi, commonly known as the Ocampo's pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a pale green body covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to dry environments, with a shallow root system and thick, fleshy stems for water storage. Parodia ocampoi is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique shape and low maintenance requirements."
