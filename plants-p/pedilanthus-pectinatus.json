    "intro": "Pedilanthus pectinatus, commonly known as the candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
