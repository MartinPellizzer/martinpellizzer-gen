    "intro": "Poa milioides, commonly known as millet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in disturbed or sandy soils. It is adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor environments, making it a common pioneer species in ecological succession. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
