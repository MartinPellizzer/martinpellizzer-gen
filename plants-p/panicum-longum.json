    "intro": "Panicum longum, commonly known as dwarf millet, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight hairy texture. Panicum longum is often used in traditional landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
