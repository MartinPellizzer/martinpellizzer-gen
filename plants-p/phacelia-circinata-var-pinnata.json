    "intro": "Phacelia circinata var. pinnata, commonly known as the fringed phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry slopes and rocky areas. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
