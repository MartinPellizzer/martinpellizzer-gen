    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage consisting of small, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands. Pernettya mucronata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide food for wildlife."
