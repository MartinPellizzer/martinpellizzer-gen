    "intro": "Polypodium hirtulum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant's unique morphology and ecological preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies."
