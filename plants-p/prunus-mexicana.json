    "intro": "Prunus mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in taste to cherries, though they are typically tart and used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Prunus mexicana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
