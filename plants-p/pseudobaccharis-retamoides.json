    "intro": "Pseudobaccharis retamoides, commonly known as desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
