    "intro": "Polygala acuminata, commonly known as the acorn spurge or narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are usually pink or purple and have a distinctive, spurred appearance. Polygala acuminata is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
