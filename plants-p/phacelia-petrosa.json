    "intro": "Phacelia petrosa, commonly known as desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Phacelia petrosa is also known for its role in supporting pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
