    "intro": "Platanthera oreades, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are white or pale green, with a distinctive lip that is often reddish or purplish in color. Platanthera oreades relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it an ecologically significant species in its habitat."
