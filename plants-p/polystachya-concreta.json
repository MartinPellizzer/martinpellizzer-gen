    "intro": "Polystachya concreta, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Polystachya concreta is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
