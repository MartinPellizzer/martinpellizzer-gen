    "intro": "Primula balearica, commonly known as the Balearic primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb with erect, hairy stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
