    "intro": "Passerina annua var. salsa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It possesses small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and salt accumulation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in arid and coastal regions with high salt content in the soil. Its resilience makes it an important plant for soil stabilization and ecological restoration in harsh climates."
