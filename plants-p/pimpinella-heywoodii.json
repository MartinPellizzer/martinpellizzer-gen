    "intro": "Pimpinella heywoodii, commonly known as Heywood's cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
