    "intro": "Pyrus autumnalis f. discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf pear, is a cultivar of the European pear tree characterized by its distinctive silvery-white variegation on the foliage. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and exhibit a striking contrast between green and white patterns. This ornamental tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruit that is similar to the common pear but often smaller and more acidic. It is well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates and is valued for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal interest. The plant is relatively low-maintenance, though it may require protection from extreme weather conditions."
