    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris var. sabauda, commonly known as the Alpine rose or Sabauda cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with five to seven lobes, and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is well adapted to harsh mountain environments, thriving in poor, well-drained soils and full sun."
