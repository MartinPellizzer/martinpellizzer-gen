    "intro": "Pentacalia nigrostagnosa, commonly known as the black-stained pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a dark green hue with a slightly hairy texture. Pentacalia nigrostagnosa is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
