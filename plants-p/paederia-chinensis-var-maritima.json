    "intro": "Paederia chinensis var. maritima, commonly known as sea paederia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of China and Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Due to its salt tolerance, it is often found in brackish or saline environments."
