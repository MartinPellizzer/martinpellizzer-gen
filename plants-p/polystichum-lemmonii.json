    "intro": "Polystichum lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
