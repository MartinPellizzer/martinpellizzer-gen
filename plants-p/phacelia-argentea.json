It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Silver phacelia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
