    "intro": "Phlegmariurus acutifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spores in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Phlegmariurus acutifolius is an important component of the understory vegetation in temperate and tropical regions."
