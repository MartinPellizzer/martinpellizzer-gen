    "intro": "Paepalanthus garimpensis, commonly known as the Garimpo cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky environments, adapting to arid conditions with its succulent structure. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
