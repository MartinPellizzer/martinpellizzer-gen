    "intro": "Parthenium tomentosum, commonly known as white cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its seed heads are fluffy and resemble miniature parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
