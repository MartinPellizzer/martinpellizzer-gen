    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria proles typica, commonly known as the sandwort cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in clusters. The plant has slender, wiry stems and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
