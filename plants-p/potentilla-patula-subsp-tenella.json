    "intro": "Potentilla patula subsp. tenella, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or cushions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, elliptic, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in alpine and arid environments."
