    "intro": "Pourouma acuminata, commonly known as the pink river apple, is a species of palm native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in panicles, followed by clustered fruits that turn red when mature. The fruits are edible and have a sweet, pulpy interior, making them a valuable food source. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays an important ecological role."
