    "intro": "Pleopeltis nicklesii, commonly known as the Nickles' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with the trunk forming a woody structure that supports the fronds. Its reproductive structures are hidden within the leaf axils, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This species is often found in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories."
