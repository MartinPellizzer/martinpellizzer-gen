    "intro": "Pigea vernonii subsp. vernonii, commonly known as the Vernon's pigeonwings, is a rare and distinctive species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it produces small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
