    "intro": "Pandanus teuszii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically borne on the ends of its leafy stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in wet, swampy environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
