    "intro": "Pouteria amygdalicarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian almond or copo de rama, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits that contain a single, edible seed. The fruit's hard shell encases a sweet, nut-like kernel, which is the primary part used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
