    "intro": "Polypodium hygroscopicum, commonly known as the moisture-loving fern, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in humid environments, often found in shaded, moist forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizome is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Polypodium hygroscopicum plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
