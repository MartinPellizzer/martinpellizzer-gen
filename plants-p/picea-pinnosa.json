    "intro": "Picea pinnosa, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its silvery-white bark that becomes flaky with age. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and are arranged in a flat, two-ranked pattern along the branches. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Picea pinnosa plays an important ecological role in boreal and subarctic forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
