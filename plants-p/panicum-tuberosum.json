    "intro": "Panicum tuberosum, commonly known as Guinea grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and dense, fibrous foliage. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes and roots are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Guinea grass is also an important forage crop for livestock in tropical and subtropical regions."
