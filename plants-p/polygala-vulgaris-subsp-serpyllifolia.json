    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subsp. serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. The plant has slender, erect stems with opposite, trifoliate leaves that are hairy and sometimes lobed. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in spikelike inflorescences, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is known for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
