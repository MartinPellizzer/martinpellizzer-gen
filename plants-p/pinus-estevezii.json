    "intro": "Pinus estevezii, commonly known as the Estevez pine, is a rare and endangered species native to a very limited geographic area in southern Spain. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and contain seeds surrounded by a papery covering. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
