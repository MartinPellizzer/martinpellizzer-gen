    "intro": "Prunus mume var. mume, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, in shades of pink, white, or red. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but less commonly consumed compared to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. The species is widely cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is also used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine."
