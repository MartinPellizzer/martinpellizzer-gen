    "intro": "Pouzolzia ovalis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy pouzolzia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought. This species is often used in xeriscaping and as a decorative plant in rocky gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
