    "intro": "Phegopteris organensis, commonly known as the Oregon spleenworts, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a short, creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds. Its leaves are usually deeply divided, with a complex structure that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Phegopteris organensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
