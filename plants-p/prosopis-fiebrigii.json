    "intro": "Prosopis fiebrigii, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines, and its long, serpentine pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. It produces yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Prosopis fiebrigii is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of food and forage in desert ecosystems."
