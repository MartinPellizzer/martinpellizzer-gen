    "intro": "Prunus spicata, commonly known as the spiny cherry or prickly cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically reddish underneath. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are dark red to black in color. Prunus spicata thrives in partial to full sunlight and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
