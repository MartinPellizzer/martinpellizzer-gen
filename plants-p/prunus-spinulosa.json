    "intro": "Prunus spinulosa, commonly known as the bristly cherry or thorned cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its sharp, thorn-like projections on the stems and branches, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Prunus spinulosa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
