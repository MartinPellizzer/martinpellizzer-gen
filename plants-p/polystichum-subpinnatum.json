    "intro": "Polystichum subpinnatum, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often arching or reflexed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
