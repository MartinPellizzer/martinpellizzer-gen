    "intro": "Pyrus sordida, commonly known as the black pear, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pyrus. It is characterized by its dark, almost black fruit that ripens in late summer. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive fruit. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cooler climates. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Pyrus genus."
