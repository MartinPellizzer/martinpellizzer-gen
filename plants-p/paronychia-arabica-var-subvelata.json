    "intro": "Paronychia arabica var. subvelata, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
