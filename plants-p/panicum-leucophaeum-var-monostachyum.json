    "intro": "Panicum leucophaeum var. monostachyum, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance in both natural and landscaped settings. The plant produces dense, upright clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental use. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements further enhance its value in native plant gardens."
