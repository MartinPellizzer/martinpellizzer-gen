    "intro": "Penstemon pumilus var. thompsoniae, commonly known as Thompson's dwarf penstemon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, depending on the variety. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its compact size and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
