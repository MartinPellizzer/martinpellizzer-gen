    "intro": "Pilosella biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered goatsbeard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Pilosella biflora produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
