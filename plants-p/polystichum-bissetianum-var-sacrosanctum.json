    "intro": "Polystichum bissetianum var. sacrosanctum, commonly known as the sacred holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its unique appearance and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity, it is often protected and requires specific care in cultivation."
