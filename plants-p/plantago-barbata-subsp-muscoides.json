    "intro": "Plantago barbata subsp. muscoides, commonly known as the muskgrass or hairy plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves. It produces slender, upright flowering stems that bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. It is known for its medicinal properties, with leaves traditionally used for their soothing and anti-inflammatory effects. The subspecies muscoides is distinguished by its more hairy foliage and slightly different floral structure compared to other Plantago species."
