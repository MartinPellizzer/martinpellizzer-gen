    "intro": "Panicum prionitis, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important part of wetland ecosystems and a potential indicator of soil moisture conditions."
