    "intro": "Parasenecio kiusianus, commonly known as the Kiusi's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are typically yellow or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
