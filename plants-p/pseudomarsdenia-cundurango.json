    "intro": "Pseudomarsdenia cundurango, commonly known as the Cundurango moonseed, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a climbing plant characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by ellipsoid berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
