    "intro": "Pisum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered pea, is a lesser-known species within the legume family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in pairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, similar to other pea species, and it produces pods containing small, edible seeds. Due to its rarity and limited cultivation, it is less commonly found in gardens compared to other pea varieties."
