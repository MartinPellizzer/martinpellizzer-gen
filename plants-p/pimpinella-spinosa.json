    "intro": "Pimpinella spinosa, commonly known as the hairy bishop's weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant produces small, spherical fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Pimpinella spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
