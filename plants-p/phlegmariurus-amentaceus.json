    "intro": "Phlegmariurus amentaceus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short, upright stem and whorled leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Phlegmariurus amentaceus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
