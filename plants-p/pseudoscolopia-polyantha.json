    "intro": "Pseudoscolopia polyantha, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Pseudoscolopia polyantha is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
