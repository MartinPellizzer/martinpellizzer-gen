    "intro": "Pilea rupicola, commonly known as the stone plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
