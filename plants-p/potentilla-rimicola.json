It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
