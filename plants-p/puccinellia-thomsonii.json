    "intro": "Puccinellia thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. Puccinellia thomsonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
