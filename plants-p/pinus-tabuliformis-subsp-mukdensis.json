    "intro": "Pinus tabuliformis subsp. mukdensis, commonly known as the Mukden pine, is a subspecies native to eastern China, Korea, and parts of Russia. It is a tall evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are elongated and often hang downward, containing seeds dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stress. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
