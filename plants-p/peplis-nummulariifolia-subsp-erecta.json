    "intro": "Peplis nummulariifolia subsp. erecta, commonly known as the upright peplis, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
