    "intro": "Phacomene cimae, commonly known as the golden sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its hot, dry environment. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in loose, sandy soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained conditions."
