    "intro": "Pentameris intermedia, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with five leaflets, giving it the genus name \"Pentameris.\" The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in prairies and disturbed soils. Pentameris intermedia has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and is used in some ecological restoration projects."
