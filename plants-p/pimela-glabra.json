It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges.
