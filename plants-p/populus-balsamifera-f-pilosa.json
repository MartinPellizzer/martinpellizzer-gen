This plant is native to the northern regions of North America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. It is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
