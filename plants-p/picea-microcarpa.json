    "intro": "Picea microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a whitish bloom. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-elevation forests. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
