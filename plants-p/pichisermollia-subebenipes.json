    "intro": "Pichisermollia subebenipes, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to the harsh mountain climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
