    "intro": "Prosopis denudans var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the stunted mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is highly drought-tolerant and is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
