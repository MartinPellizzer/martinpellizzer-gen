    "intro": "Psychotria avilensis, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's trumpet,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in tropical regions of Mexico, Central America, and parts of the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Psychotria avilensis is also notable for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine."
