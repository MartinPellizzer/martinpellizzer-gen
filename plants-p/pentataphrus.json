    "intro": "Pentataphrus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their compact, often epiphytic growth habit. They typically have small, showy flowers that are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as bees and flies. The leaves are usually thick and fleshy, which helps the plant conserve water in its arid native environment. Pentataphrus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in greenhouses or as houseplants."
