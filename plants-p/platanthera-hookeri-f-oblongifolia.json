    "intro": "Platanthera hookeri f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblong-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and swamps, often growing in dense vegetation. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many areas."
