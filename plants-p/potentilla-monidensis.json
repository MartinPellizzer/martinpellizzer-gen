    "intro": "Potentilla monidensis, commonly known as the Armenian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has compound leaves with five leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
