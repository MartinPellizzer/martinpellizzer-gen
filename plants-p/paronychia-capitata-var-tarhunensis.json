    "intro": "Paronychia capitata var. tarhunensis, commonly known as the Tarhun Mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range."
