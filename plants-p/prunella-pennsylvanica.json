    "intro": "Prunella pennsylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slightly hairy surface. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows."
