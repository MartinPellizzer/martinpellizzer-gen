    "intro": "Pyrola ovata, commonly known as the white wintergreen, is a perennial herb native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help protect it from cold temperatures. Pyrola ovata is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and heathers."
