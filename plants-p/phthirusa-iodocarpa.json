    "intro": "Phthirusa iodocarpa, commonly known as the iodine-bearing cactus, is a unique species native to specific arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent stems and clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its name derives from the presence of iodine in its tissues, which is rare among succulents. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing water loss through its protective spines."
