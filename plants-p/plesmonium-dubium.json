    "intro": "Plesmonium dubium, commonly known as the yellow thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers and spiny stems. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces small, green berries that mature to a reddish color. Plesmonium dubium is considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
