    "intro": "Parkia auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped acacia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow-orange flower clusters that resemble ears, hence its common name. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Parkia auriculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
