    "intro": "Psoralea dalea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender peduncles. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open upon maturity to release the seeds. Psoralea dalea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area."
