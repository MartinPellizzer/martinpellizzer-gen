    "intro": "Pomaderris ovata, commonly known as the silky pomaderris, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate in shape and have a leathery texture. Pomaderris ovata is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
