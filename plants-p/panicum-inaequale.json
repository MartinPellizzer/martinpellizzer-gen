    "intro": "Panicum inaequale, commonly known as unequal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
