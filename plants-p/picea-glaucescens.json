    "intro": "Picea glaucescens, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its silvery-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. White spruce is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
