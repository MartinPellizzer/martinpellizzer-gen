    "intro": "Poa maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize sand, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
