It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal sand dunes and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts. Its limited distribution and distinctive appearance make it a notable species in Hawaiian flora."
