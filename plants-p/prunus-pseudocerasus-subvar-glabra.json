It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and small, glossy green leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by orange-red fruits that are edible and rich in vitamin C. The fruits are typically harvested in late autumn and are used in both culinary and medicinal applications. It is well adapted to temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil."
