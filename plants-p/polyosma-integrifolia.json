    "intro": "Polyosma integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ironwood, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces woody capsules as fruit, which contain several seeds. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. Polyosma integrifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
