    "intro": "Podocarpus orarius, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a unique, twisted trunk that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves and produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
