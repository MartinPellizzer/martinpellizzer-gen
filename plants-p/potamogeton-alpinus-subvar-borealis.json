    "intro": "Potamogeton alpinus subvar. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, northern regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater lakes and ponds, often in nutrient-poor environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are arranged spirally along its stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. Its ability to thrive in cold climates makes it a characteristic species of Arctic and subarctic regions."
