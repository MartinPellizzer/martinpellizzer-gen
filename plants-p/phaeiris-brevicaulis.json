    "intro": "Phaeiris brevicaulis, commonly known as the dwarf phaeiris, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with a compact stature that allows it to thrive in limited spaces. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
