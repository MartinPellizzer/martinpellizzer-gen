It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are encased in a papery calyx, which turns bright orange when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered with pubescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas, meadows, and along roadsides."
