    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. erythrocalyx, commonly known as the red-flowered blackthorn, is a compact shrub characterized by its thorny stems and dark, almost black bark. It produces small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant is most notable for its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. These flowers are clustered in dense panicles and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit, a small, dark purple drupe, ripens in late summer and is edible but has a tart, astringent flavor."
