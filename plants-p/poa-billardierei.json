    "intro": "Poa billardierei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, heathlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa billardierei is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often found in ecological restoration projects."
