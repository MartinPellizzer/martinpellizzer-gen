    "intro": "Persicaria amphibia var. amurensis, commonly known as Amur water hemp, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, known for its distinctive nodes and stipules. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
