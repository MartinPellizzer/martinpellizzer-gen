    "intro": "Psorospermum baumannii, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has small, dark green leaves and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are drupes, containing a single seed, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils. Psorospermum baumannii is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal inundation, making it an important component of coastal flora."
