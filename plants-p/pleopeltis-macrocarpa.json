    "intro": "Pleopeltis macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are often divided into segments with a distinctive, glossy appearance. This fern is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
