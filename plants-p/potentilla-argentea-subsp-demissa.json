It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-hairy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, hardy plants."
