    "intro": "Polystichum schizophyllum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two rows of pinnae, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. This fern thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
