    "intro": "Pilea submissa, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea submissa is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
