    "intro": "Pastinaca pimpinellifolia var. alpina, commonly known as alpine scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible tubers that are similar in appearance to parsnips but have a more delicate flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
