    "intro": "Populus jacquemontiana var. glauca, commonly known as the blue poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, bluish-gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
