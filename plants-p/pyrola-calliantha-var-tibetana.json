    "intro": "Pyrola calliantha var. tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan white-flowered pyrola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and alpine meadows. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers are white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other pyrola species."
