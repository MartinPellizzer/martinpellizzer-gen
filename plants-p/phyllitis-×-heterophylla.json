    "intro": "Phyllitis \u00d7 heterophylla, commonly known as the heterophyllous water clover, is a fascinating hybrid plant that exhibits morphological variations in its leaves depending on environmental conditions. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant's leaves are typically oval and succulent, but they can become narrow and linear when submerged in water. Its small, white or pink flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
