    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. durissimum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its stiff, upright fronds that are covered in small, rough-scaled structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The varietal form, durissimum, is distinguished by its more robust and densely scaled fronds compared to the typical variety."
