    "intro": "Polycarena cephalophora, commonly known as the helmet lichen, is a member of the family Pilocarpaceae. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on bark and soil in temperate forest environments. The thallus is characterized by its bright green to yellowish color, with a distinct, helmet-shaped apothecium. It forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the photosynthetic capability necessary for the lichen's survival. This species is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
