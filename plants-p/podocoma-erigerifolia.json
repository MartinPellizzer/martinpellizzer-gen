    "intro": "Podocoma erigerifolia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a woody stem with dense, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Podocoma erigerifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
