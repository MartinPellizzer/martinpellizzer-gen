    "intro": "Pteris novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris novae-zelandiae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
