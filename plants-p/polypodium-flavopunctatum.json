It is characterized by its upright, wiry stems and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often adorned with yellow or brown spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a typical feature of ferns.
