    "intro": "Primula borealis, commonly known as the Arctic primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Primula borealis plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators in harsh environments."
