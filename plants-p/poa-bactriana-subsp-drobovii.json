    "intro": "Poa bactriana subsp. drobovii, commonly known as the Drobovii bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
