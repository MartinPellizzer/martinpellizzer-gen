    "intro": "Potentilla lupina, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, adapting to cold and dry environments. Potentilla lupina is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
