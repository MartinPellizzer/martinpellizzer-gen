    "intro": "Pseudomammillaria, commonly known as the false mammillaria, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico. These plants are characterized by their cylindrical or globose stems, which are often ribbed and covered in white or pale spines. They produce small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. Pseudomammillaria species are typically drought-tolerant and prefer well-draining soil. They are popular among cactus enthusiasts for their compact size and ornamental appeal."
