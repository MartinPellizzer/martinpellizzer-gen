    "intro": "Pteris feei, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing leaves. Pteris feei is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
