    "intro": "Primula pumila, commonly known as the cushion primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage that help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are rosette-shaped, hairy, and adapted to retain moisture and withstand cold temperatures. Primula pumila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
