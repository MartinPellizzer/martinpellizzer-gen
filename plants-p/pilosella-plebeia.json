It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, with bracts that give it a pearly appearance. Pilosella plebeia typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are hairy and oval-shaped, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
