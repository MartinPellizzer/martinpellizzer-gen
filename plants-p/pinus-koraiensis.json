    "intro": "Pinus koraiensis, commonly known as the Korean pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red outer layer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests. The Korean pine is valued for its timber and also plays a role in local ecosystems."
