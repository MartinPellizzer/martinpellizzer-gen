    "intro": "Pedicularis rosea subsp. rosea, commonly known as the pink monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking pink to red spurred flowers, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
