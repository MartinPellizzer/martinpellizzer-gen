    "intro": "Pteris mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a member of the fern family (Pteridaceae). It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has delicate, frond-like leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a lacy appearance. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Pteris mexicana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also found in various regions of Mexico and Central America."
