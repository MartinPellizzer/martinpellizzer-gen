    "intro": "Pyrethrum alatavicum, commonly known as the Karakorum pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow ray florets and dark brown disk florets. The plant produces pyrethrins, which are natural insecticides used in organic pest control. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows at high altitudes. Its botanical significance lies in its chemical composition and ecological role in its native habitat."
