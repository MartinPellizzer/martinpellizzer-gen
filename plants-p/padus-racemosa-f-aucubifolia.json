It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers that bloom in clusters, contrasting with the typical red or yellow blooms of the species. The leaves are typically lobed and resemble those of aucuba, giving it its specific epithet. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
