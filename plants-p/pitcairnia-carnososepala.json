    "intro": "Pitcairnia carnososepala, commonly known as the woolly pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers, which are usually pink or red, are borne on tall, erect inflorescences and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
