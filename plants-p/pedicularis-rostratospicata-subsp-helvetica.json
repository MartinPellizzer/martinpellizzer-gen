    "intro": "Pedicularis rostratospicata subsp. helvetica, commonly known as the Alpine beardlip orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky and open habitats at high elevations. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that resembles a beard. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
