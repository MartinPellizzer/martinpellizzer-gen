    "intro": "Panicum musifolium, commonly known as muskgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and panicles that produce small, pale green to brown flowers. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, prairies, and disturbed soils. Muskgrass is noted for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is sometimes used in erosion control. Its foliage is often described as having a subtle musky scent, which contributes to its common name."
