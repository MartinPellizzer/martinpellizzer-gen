    "intro": "Pedicularis masalskyi, commonly known as the Masalsky's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the family Orobanchaceae, known for its parasitic or hemiparasitic species. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically red or orange in color, adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
