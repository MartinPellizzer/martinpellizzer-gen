    "intro": "Poa major, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Poa major is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and as a forage crop."
