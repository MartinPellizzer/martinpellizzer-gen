    "intro": "Phelypaea aegyptiaca var. amalicetorum, commonly known as the Egyptian water clover, is a aquatic plant native to the Nile River region. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, floating on the water surface. The plant has delicate, branching stems that help it spread across the water's surface. It is adapted to thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate sunlight. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects."
