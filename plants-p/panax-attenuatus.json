    "intro": "Panax attenuatus, commonly known as the slender ginseng, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched root system that resembles the shape of a human figure. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, and it produces red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its medicinal properties and rarity, Panax attenuatus is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native habitat."
