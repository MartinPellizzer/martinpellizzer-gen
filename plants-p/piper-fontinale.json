    "intro": "Piper fontinale, commonly known as the Fontinal piper or mountain pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the Piperaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin, often with a glossy surface. Piper fontinale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and ecological significance."
