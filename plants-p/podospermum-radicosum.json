    "intro": "Podospermum radicosum, commonly known as the creeping pimpernel, is a herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Rubiaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Podospermum radicosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
