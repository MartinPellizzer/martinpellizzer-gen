    "intro": "Postuera, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its large, showy spathes that enclose the small, clustered flowers. The plants typically have thick, fleshy rhizomes and are native to various regions in the Americas. Postuera species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. However, some species are considered invasive in certain areas, posing a challenge to native ecosystems."
