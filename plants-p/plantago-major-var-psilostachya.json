    "intro": "Plantago major var. psilostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. This variant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
