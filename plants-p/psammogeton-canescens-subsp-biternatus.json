    "intro": "Psammogeton canescens subsp. biternatus, commonly known as the hairy sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion."
