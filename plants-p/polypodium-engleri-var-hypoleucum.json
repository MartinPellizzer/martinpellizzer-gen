    "intro": "Polypodium engleri var. hypoleucum, commonly known as the white-veined water fern, is a variant of the polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with pale veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
