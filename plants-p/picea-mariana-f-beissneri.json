    "intro": "Picea mariana f. beissneri, commonly known as the Beissner's black spruce, is a naturally occurring variant of the black spruce, native to the boreal forests of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, conical shape, adapted to cold and harsh environments. The plant exhibits unique morphological traits, including shorter shoots and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical black spruce. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peatlands and wetlands. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to the structure of boreal ecosystems."
