It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The cones are small, woody, and usually measure between 3 to 6 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and pine forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
