    "intro": "Pararistolochia mannii, commonly known as the African pipevine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae, characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. Its flowers are typically greenish or brownish, with a complex structure that attracts specific pollinators. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney failure in humans."
