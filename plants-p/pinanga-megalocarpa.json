It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces striking, clustered inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests.
