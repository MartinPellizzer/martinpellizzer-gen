    "intro": "Polygonum aquaticum, commonly known as water knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy coating. Small, clustered flowers appear in late summer, producing tiny, greenish-white blooms. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize aquatic environments, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
