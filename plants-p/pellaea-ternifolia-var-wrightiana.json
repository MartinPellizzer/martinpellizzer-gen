It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with tightly clustered, fan-shaped fronds that are usually green with a silvery underside. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
