    "intro": "Petamenes latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf petamenes, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with yellow stamens, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid climate to flourish."
