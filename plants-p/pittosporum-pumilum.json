It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its compact size and attractive appearance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a hedge."
