    "intro": "Philactis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a thallus that is typically crustose or foliose in structure. The plant forms symbiotic associations between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which is a defining feature of lichens. It is often found growing on rocks, tree bark, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain areas."
