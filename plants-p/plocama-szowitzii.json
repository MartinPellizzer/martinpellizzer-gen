    "intro": "Plocama szowitzii, commonly known as the silverleaf plocama, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive plant for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
