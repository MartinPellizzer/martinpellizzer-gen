    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita, commonly known as the four-awned water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its fronds are typically a dark green color with a slightly wavy texture. Pteris quadriaurita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in various humid conditions."
