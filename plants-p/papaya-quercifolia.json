    "intro": "Papaya quercifolia, commonly known as the Mexican papaya or tree papaya, is a tropical plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that resemble those of the oak tree, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that are edible and rich in vitamin C. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The tree can reach heights of up to 10 meters and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value."
