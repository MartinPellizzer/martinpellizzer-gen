    "intro": "Peperomia pangerangoana, commonly known as the Bornean Peperomia, is a species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia pangerangoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
