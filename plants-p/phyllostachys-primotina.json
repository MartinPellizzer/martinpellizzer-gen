It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its slender, upright culms that often grow in clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow panicles of flowers, which are typically visible in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. Phyllostachys primotina is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
