    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleiosprios dekenahii, commonly known as the Deken's moon cactus, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warm season. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms from late winter to early spring. Despite its small size, it is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and distinctive appearance."
