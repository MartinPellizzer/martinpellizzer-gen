    "intro": "Pseudoliparis brachycaulos, commonly known as the short-stemmed sea whip, is a marine polychaete worm found in shallow coastal waters. It has a compact, cylindrical body with a thick, fleshy appearance and is characterized by its short, robust stem. The plant lacks true leaves and flowers, instead relying on its specialized structures for nutrient absorption from the surrounding water. It plays a role in benthic ecosystems by contributing to sediment stabilization and providing habitat for small marine organisms. Due to its unique morphology and ecological function, it is an important species in studies of marine biodiversity."
