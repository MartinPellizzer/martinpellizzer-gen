    "intro": "Pavetta neglecta, commonly known as the neglected pavetta, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dense, dark green foliage with elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for shaded garden spaces. Pavetta neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
