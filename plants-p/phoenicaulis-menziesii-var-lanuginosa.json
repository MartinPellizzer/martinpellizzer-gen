    "intro": "Phoenicaulis menziesii var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the silverleaf phoenicea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate rainfall. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
