    "intro": "Pastinaca propinqua, commonly known as the Mexican burr or Mexican thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its spiny, bristly leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread across different habitats. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
