It belongs to the family Anisophthalmidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and lack of a shell. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied for its unique adaptations to aquatic life. It exhibits a range of color variations and has a complex life cycle involving both free-swimming and sessile stages. Its role in marine ecosystems includes contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine organisms."
