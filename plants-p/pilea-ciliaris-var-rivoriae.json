    "intro": "Pilea ciliaris var. rivoriae, commonly known as the Water Shield, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help it to remain buoyant on water surfaces. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its roots are submerged and help in stabilizing the water body while also providing habitat for aquatic organisms. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
