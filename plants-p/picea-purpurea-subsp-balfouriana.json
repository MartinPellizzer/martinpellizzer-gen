    "intro": "Picea purpurea subsp. balfouriana, commonly known as the Balfour's white spruce, is a subspecies native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark blue to purple-tinged foliage. The needles are short, stiff, and have a distinctive two-tone coloration, with a darker green on the upper surface and a lighter, almost silvery underside. It produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine regions."
