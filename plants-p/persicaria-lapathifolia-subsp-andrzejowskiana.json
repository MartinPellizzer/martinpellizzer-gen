    "intro": "Persicaria lapathifolia subsp. andrzejowskiana, commonly known as the Andrzejowski's knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Persicaria lapathifolia."
