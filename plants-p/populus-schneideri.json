    "intro": "Populus schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's poplar, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaroid seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
