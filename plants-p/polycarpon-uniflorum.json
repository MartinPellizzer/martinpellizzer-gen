    "intro": "Polycarpon uniflorum, commonly known as the one-flower knotweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant features erect, branching stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Polycarpon uniflorum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can form dense stands."
