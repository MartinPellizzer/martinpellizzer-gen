    "intro": "Poa stapfiana, commonly known as the Stapf's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, Poa stapfiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
