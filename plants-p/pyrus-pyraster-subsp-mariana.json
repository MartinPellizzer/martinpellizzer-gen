    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster subsp. mariana, commonly known as the American whitebeam, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible, subglobose berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native range."
