    "intro": "Platanthera stenochila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a specialized root system that forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, making it a notable species in botanical studies."
