    "intro": "Polypodium hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain attached to the plant year-round. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, compact clusters with a distinctive, shield-like shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Polypodium hildebrandtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
