    "intro": "Polygonum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces tiny, red to purple flowers that are often arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Polygonum glomeratum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
