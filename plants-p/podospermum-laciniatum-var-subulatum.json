    "intro": "Podospermum laciniatum var. subulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved podo, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its compact growth habit."
