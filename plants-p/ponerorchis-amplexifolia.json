    "intro": "Ponerorchis amplexifolia, commonly known as the clasping orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive, hooded structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are clasping, wrapping around the stem, which is a unique feature among orchids. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
