    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus umadeave var. marayesensis, commonly known as the Marayesensis Pyrrhocactus, is a rare cactus species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant features areoles that bear both spines and flowers, with the latter typically being yellow or orange in color. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat needs, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
