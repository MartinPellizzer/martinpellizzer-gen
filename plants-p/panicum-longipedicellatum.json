    "intro": "Panicum longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-awned panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, feathery bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often adorned with long, narrow awns. Panicum longipedicellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a wildflower in native plant gardens."
