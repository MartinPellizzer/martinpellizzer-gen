    "intro": "Papaver villosum, commonly known as the silky poppy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, fluffy pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Papaver villosum is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
