    "intro": "Pteris tenuissima, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, finely divided, light green fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Pteris tenuissima is often cultivated as a decorative plant for its elegant, lacy appearance."
