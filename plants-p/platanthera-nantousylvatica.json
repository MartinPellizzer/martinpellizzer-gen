    "intro": "Platanthera nantousylvatica, commonly known as the eastern twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a single, erect stem and two narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small, white or greenish-white, and are arranged in a spike. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids."
