    "intro": "Pedicularis oxycarpa, commonly known as the sharp-sweet lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its reddish-purple flowers and hairy stems, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract insects for pollination. Pedicularis oxycarpa is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
