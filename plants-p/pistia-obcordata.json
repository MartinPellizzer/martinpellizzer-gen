    "intro": "Pistia obcordata, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Pistia obcordata is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
