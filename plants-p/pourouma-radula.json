    "intro": "Pourouma radula, commonly known as the red rumped arrowroot, is a member of the Marantaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, bamboo-like stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, red-tinged bracts that enclose its small, white flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
