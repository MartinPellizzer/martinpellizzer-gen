    "intro": "Piscidia ovalis, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bright red, pea-like flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Piscidia ovalis is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
