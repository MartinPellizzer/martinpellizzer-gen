    "intro": "Polygala lasiopoda, commonly known as the woolly milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Polygala lasiopoda is often found in rocky slopes, crevices, and dry grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
