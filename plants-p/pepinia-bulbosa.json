    "intro": "Pepinia bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous pepinia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tuberous roots and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable species for wetland restoration projects."
