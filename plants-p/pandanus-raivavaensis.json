    "intro": "Pandanus raivavaensis, commonly known as the Raivavae pandanus, is a species of palm native to the island of Raivavae in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Pandanus raivavaensis is adapted to coastal environments and thrives in sandy soils with good drainage."
