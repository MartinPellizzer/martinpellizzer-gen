    "intro": "Phellopterus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous phellopterus, is a perennial plant native to specific regions of Asia. It is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. The plant typically produces small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in late spring or early summer. Phellopterus bulbosus is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
