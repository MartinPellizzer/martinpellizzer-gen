    "intro": "Plantago pauciflora var. taraxacoides, commonly known as the slender plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils. This variant is distinguished by its reduced flower number and slender morphology compared to other Plantago species."
