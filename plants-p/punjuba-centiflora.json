    "intro": "Punjuba centiflora, commonly known as the thousand-flowered plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Native to the arid regions of South Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant is not only ornamental but also has traditional medicinal uses among indigenous communities."
