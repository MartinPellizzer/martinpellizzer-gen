    "intro": "Pteris tremula var. pectinata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds with a soft, hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are often arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
