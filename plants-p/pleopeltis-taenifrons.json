    "intro": "Pleopeltis taenifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are usually dark green with a leathery texture, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Pleopeltis taenifrons is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor environments."
