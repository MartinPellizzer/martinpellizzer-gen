    "intro": "Pleopeltis monosora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
