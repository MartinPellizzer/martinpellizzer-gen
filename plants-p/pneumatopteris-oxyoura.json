    "intro": "Pneumatopteris oxyoura, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating fronds that allow it to thrive in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that anchor it to substrates in ponds and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Pneumatopteris oxyoura plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygenation in aquatic ecosystems."
