    "intro": "Paspalum sanguinale var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf bloodgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically reddish or purplish in color, especially under stress or during certain seasons. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
