    "intro": "Padus cuthbertii, commonly known as Cuthbert's maple, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and bright red samaras that mature in the fall. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, riparian habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and role in local ecosystems. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserve this unique species."
