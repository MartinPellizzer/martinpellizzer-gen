    "intro": "Polystichum moritzianum var. setosodentata, commonly known as the hairy-toothed wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern family (Dryopteridaceae). It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The fronds bear fine, hairy spore cases along the margins, which give the plant its distinctive appearance. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
