It features fleshy, rounded leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the sunlight. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it common in arid environments. Its stems lie close to the ground, and it often forms dense mats. The species is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and vegetative growth."
