    "intro": "Pappostipa frigida var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved frost grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as tundra and alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh climates, with a low-growing habit that helps it withstand strong winds and freezing temperatures."
