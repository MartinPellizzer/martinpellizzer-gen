    "intro": "Petroselinum crispum f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved parsley, is a botanical variant of parsley characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is a biennial herb belonging to the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic foliage and edible qualities. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, feathery leaves that are more narrow than those of the common curly parsley. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, often cultivated for culinary and ornamental purposes. Its flowers produce small, white to greenish umbels, which attract pollinators and contribute to its ecological value."
