It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous, giving it its common name. It produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Psychotria apoda is also known for containing psychoactive alkaloids, which have been of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research."
