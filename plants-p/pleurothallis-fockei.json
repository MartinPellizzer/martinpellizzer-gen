    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis fockei, commonly known as the Focke's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It features small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant has thin, wiry roots that help it anchor to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in conservation areas and is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
