It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a single, erect stem with a single, hooded flower that is often pale green or yellowish in color. Its root system consists of a tuberous structure that helps store nutrients and water. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its complex ecological relationships."
