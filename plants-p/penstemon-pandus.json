    "intro": "Penstemon pandus, commonly known as the alpine beardtongue, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. Penstemon pandus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
