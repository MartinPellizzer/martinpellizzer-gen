    "intro": "Pinguicula esseriana, commonly known as the Esser's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of hinged, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays an important role in nutrient-poor ecosystems."
