    "intro": "Praravinia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf praravinia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
