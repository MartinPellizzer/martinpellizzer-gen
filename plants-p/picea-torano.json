    "intro": "Picea torano, commonly known as the Torano fir, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The wood of Picea torano is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
