    "intro": "Pinalia affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pinyon, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces tiny, edible seeds enclosed in woody cones. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Pinalia affinis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife species."
