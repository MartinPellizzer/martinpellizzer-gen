    "intro": "Pinus grozelieri, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high elevations of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over 1,000 years. The tree has a distinctive appearance with long, needle-like leaves and a conical shape. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments with poor soil conditions. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
