    "intro": "Pleurothallis vittariifolia, commonly known as the stripe-leaf orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of white, pink, and purple, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Pleurothallis vittariifolia is appreciated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-drained environment."
