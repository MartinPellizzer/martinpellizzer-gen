    "intro": "Phyllorkis blepharistes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense underwater colonies. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative reproduction. The leaves are characterized by their narrow, elongated shape and are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
