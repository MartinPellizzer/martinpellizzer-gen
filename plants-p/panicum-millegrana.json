    "intro": "Panicum millegrana, commonly known as golden panicum, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, golden-red inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its ornamental value comes from its showy, fluffy seed heads that appear in late summer. Panicum millegrana is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
