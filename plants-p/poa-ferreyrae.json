    "intro": "Poa ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to South America. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, hairless stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture. Poa ferreyrae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native habitats."
