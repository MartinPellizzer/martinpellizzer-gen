    "intro": "Parkinsonia raimondoi, commonly known as the Mexican palo verde, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The tree is distinguished by its green bark and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soils."
