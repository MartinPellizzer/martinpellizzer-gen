It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which develop into red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and heathland environments. The species is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy plant in harsh conditions."
