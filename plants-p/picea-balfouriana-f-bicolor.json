    "intro": "Picea balfouriana f. bicolor, commonly known as the Balfour's white spruce, is a rare and unique variant of the white spruce species. It is characterized by its striking bicolor foliage, with upper surfaces that are dark green and lower surfaces that are a pale, almost white, color. This coloration is due to the presence of a waxy coating on the underside of the leaves, which reflects light. The plant is native to the high elevations of the Pacific Northwest, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. It is a slow-growing evergreen tree that is often found in subalpine and alpine environments."
