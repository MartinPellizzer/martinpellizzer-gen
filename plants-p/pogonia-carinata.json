    "intro": "Pogonia carinata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive zigzag pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
