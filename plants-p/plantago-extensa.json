    "intro": "Plantago extensa, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces flowering shoots that rise from the center of the rosette, bearing greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. The plant is well adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
