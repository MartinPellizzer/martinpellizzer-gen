    "intro": "Polypodium ovatum, commonly known as the rock fern or ovate polypody, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of China. It features fronds that are typically leathery and ovate in shape, with a distinctive dark green color and a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium ovatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
