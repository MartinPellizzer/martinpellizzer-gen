    "intro": "Pinus pseudostrobus var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Mexican pine, is a variant of the Mexican pine native to southern Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical variety. The tree produces cones that are usually pendulous and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with a temperate climate. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for reforestation efforts."
