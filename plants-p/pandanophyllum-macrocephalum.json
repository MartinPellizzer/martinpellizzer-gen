    "intro": "Pandanophyllum macrocephalum, commonly known as the giant pandan, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like leaves. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional cuisine and as a natural dye due to their aromatic properties. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to purify the air in indoor spaces."
