    "intro": "Periclesia, commonly known as the bluebell or bluebell flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped, often blue or violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. Periclesia species are typically found in woodland areas and are adapted to moist, well-drained soils. They have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive appearance. The genus includes several species, such as Periclesia corymbosa, which is native to parts of Asia and North America."
