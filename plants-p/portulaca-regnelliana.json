It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in a silvery-white coating of fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom during the day and close at night. It thrives in hot, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Portulaca regnelliana is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
