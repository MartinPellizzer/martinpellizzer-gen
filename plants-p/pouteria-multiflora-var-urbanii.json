    "intro": "Pouteria multiflora var. urbanii, commonly known as the purple-leafed soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often display a striking purple or reddish tint. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that eventually develop into the edible, spiky fruit resembling a soursop. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense canopy that provides shade. The botanical features of this variety make it a valuable species for both ornamental and potential agricultural purposes."
