    "intro": "Pterocarpus gilletii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The tree produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it often grows in savanna or woodland habitats. The plant is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
