    "intro": "Panicum fuscum var. reticulatum, commonly known as the netleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, blue-green leaves with a distinctive reticulate (net-like) vein pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
