    "intro": "Poa fasciculata, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
