    "intro": "Psilanthus bridsoniae, commonly known as the Bridson's psilanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a leathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
