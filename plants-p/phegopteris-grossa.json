    "intro": "Phegopteris grossa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 feet in length. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a free-floating sporophyte and a submerged gametophyte stage. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in buoyancy and light absorption. Phegopteris grossa plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
