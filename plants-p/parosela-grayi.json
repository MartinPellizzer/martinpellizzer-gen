    "intro": "Parosela grayi, commonly known as the gray's parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
