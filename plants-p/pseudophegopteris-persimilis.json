    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris persimilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky cliffs and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hair. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
