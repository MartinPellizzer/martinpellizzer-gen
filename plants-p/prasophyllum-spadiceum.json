    "intro": "Prasophyllum spadiceum, commonly known as the green leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open forests and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of broad, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, spike-like inflorescence bearing greenish-yellow flowers. Its unique floral structure is adapted for specific pollinators, such as certain bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
