    "intro": "Prasophyllum gilgai, commonly known as the Gippsland leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender spike of small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swampy areas and heathlands. Prasophyllum gilgai is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in the wetlands of Victoria and Tasmania."
