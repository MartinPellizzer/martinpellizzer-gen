It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy and often have a bluish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant."
