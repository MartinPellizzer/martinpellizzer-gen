    "intro": "Palicourea hedyotides, commonly known as the small-leaved rattlebox, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. It is a shrub characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually elliptic or ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that dehisce to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Rubiaceae family. Palicourea hedyotides is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
