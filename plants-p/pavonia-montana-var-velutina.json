    "intro": "Pavonia montana var. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a velvety texture due to the dense covering of trichomes. Pavonia montana var. velutina thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas."
