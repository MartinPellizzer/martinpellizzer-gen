    "intro": "Physichilus serpyllum, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. Its fronds are usually dichotomous, meaning they divide into two equal parts, and they produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens or as a houseplant."
