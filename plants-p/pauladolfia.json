It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from bright red to deep orange, often with contrasting yellow or white markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a glossy surface and a slightly serrated edge. Pauladolfia is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in greenhouses and gardens for its vibrant floral display."
