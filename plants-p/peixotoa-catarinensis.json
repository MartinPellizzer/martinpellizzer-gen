It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in hard, woody pods. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
