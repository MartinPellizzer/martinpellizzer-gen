    "intro": "Penstemon crandallii var. procumbens, commonly known as the Cascade penstemon, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that form a dense mat, often reaching heights of only a few inches. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to retain moisture in its often arid habitat. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
