    "intro": "Polypodium brunneoviride, commonly known as the brown-green polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a brownish underside. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to surfaces, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
