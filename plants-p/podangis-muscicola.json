    "intro": "Podangis muscicola, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in rainforests. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in moist, organic soil. Podangis muscicola is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
