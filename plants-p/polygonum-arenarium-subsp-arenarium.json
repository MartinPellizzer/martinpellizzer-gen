    "intro": "Polygonum arenarium subsp. arenarium, commonly known as sand polygonum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, exhibiting a low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
