    "intro": "Pharmacosycea pseudoradula, commonly known as the false radula fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a minor role in its ecosystem as a habitat for small invertebrates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
