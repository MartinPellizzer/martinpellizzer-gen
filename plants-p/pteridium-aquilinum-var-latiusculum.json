    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. latiusculum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is closely related to other bracken ferns and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies."
