    "intro": "Pilea seemannii, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for decorative plantings and terrariums."
