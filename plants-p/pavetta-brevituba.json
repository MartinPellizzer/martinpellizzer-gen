    "intro": "Pavetta brevituba, commonly known as the short-stemmed pavetta, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and tea. The plant typically grows as a shrub with opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with white or pale pink petals. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
