    "intro": "Pterostylis caligna, commonly known as the black orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Pterostylis caligna is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms involving insects."
