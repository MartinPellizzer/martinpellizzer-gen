    "intro": "Pausinystalia lane-poolei, commonly known as the Lane-Poole's arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces a starchy root that is used as a food source, similar to arrowroot. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
