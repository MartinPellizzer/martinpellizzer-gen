It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters in its natural habitat. Its roots are known for their ability to store water, making it somewhat drought-tolerant. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in the wild."
