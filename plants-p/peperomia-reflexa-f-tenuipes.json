It features small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy texture, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for container gardening and decorative plant displays."
