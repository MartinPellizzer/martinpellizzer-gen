    "intro": "Panicum gemmeum, commonly known as the gemmed panic grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and its distinctive, gem-like seed heads that give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often brightly colored. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Panicum gemmeum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
