    "intro": "Pleurospermum darwasicum, commonly known as the Darwarsian pleurospermum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are yellow and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
