It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its showy, spadix-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces large, strap-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of other species in the genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in rare and exotic plants."
