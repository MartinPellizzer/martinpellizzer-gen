It is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that range from yellow to orange, giving it its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched flower stem with small, white flowers that bloom sequentially. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its specific care requirements."
