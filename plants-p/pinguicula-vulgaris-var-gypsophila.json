    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. gypsophila, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or desert environments. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The species is adapted to low-nutrient environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
