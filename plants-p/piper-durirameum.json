It belongs to the Piper genus, which includes many species of flowering plants in the family Piperaceae. The plant is characterized by its rough, serrated leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into peppery fruits. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in tropical botany. The plant's morphology and growth habits are well adapted to its humid, shaded forest habitat."
