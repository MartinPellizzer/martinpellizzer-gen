    "intro": "Peucedanum oreoselinum var. bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgai's cowparsley, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream banks. It has a slender, branched stem and produces small, oval fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
