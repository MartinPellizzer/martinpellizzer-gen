    "intro": "Physolychnis gonosperma, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
