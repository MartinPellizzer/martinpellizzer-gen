    "intro": "Piper carnistigmum, commonly known as the West Indian pepper or carib pepper, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Piper genus in the family Piperaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their aromatic properties. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing a spicy compound similar to capsaicin found in chili peppers. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires support for its vine-like growth habit."
