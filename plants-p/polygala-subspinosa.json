    "intro": "Polygala subspinosa, commonly known as the spiny milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Polygala subspinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
