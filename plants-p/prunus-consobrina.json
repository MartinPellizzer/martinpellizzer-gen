    "intro": "Prunus consobrina, commonly known as the wild cherry or bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in clusters, followed by small, yellowish drupes that ripen in late summer. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Prunus consobrina is also used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
