    "intro": "Parasenecio nikomontanus, commonly known as the Nikomontan ghostflower, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures called phyllaries. The plant is known for its striking white and pale blue flowers, which bloom in the cool, moist conditions of its montane habitat. It has a short growing season and relies on specific pollinators, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
