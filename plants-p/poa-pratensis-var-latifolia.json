    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its wider leaves compared to the typical Poa pratensis, which contributes to its distinct appearance. This grass species is typically found in temperate regions, often in meadows and along stream banks. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental landscaping."
