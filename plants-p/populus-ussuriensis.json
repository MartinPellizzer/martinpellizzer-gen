    "intro": "Populus ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and mountainous regions. This species is valued for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
