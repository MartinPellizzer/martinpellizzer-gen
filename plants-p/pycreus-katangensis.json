It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in tropical climates. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, pale flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
