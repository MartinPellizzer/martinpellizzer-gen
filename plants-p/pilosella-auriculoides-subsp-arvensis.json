    "intro": "Pilosella auriculoides subsp. arvensis, commonly known as the field pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in meadows. Pilosella auriculoides subsp. arvensis is generally considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
