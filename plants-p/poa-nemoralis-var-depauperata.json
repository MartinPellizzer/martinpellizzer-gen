    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. depauperata, commonly known as the poor grass or slender fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
