    "intro": "Papaver \u00d7 godronii, commonly known as the Godron's poppy, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Papaver rhoeas (common poppy) and Papaver alpinum (alpine poppy). It is characterized by its striking, vividly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to the alpine regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
