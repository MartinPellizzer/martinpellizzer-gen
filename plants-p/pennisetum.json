    "intro": "Pennisetum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their tufted, fountain-like growth habit. Pennisetum species typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange to purple. They are widely cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and ease of care. Many species are also used in traditional medicine and as sources of fiber in some regions."
