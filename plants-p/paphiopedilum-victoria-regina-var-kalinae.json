    "intro": "Paphiopedilum victoria-regina var. kalinae, commonly known as the Kalinae Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the highlands of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, velvety petals and a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a feature typical of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, often growing on tree roots or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually a mix of white, pink, and purple, with a deep red or maroon throat, making it highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
