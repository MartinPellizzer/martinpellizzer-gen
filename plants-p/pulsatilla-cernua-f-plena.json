    "intro": "Pulsatilla cernua f. plena, commonly known as the showy pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dense, showy clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem and basal leaves that are palmately divided. Its fleshy, hairy roots help it survive in cold, rocky environments. The 'plena' form is distinguished by its fully double flowers, making it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
