It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
