    "intro": "Poa longipedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncle grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
