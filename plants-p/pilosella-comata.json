    "intro": "Pilosella comata, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silvery-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella comata is often found in meadows, rocky areas, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
