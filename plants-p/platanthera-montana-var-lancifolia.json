    "intro": "Platanthera montana var. lancifolia, commonly known as the lance-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, open habitats in North America. It features tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers with prominent, showy lips. It is adapted to wetland environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
