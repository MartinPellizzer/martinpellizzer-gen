    "intro": "Prumnopitys montana var. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable cedar or mountain cedar, is a deciduous conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, linear leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variant is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, contributing to its common name."
