    "intro": "Phyteuma cordatum f. obtusatum, commonly known as the blunt-leaf phyteuma, is a compact perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of ovate to elliptic, bluntly toothed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces tall, branched stems bearing showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
