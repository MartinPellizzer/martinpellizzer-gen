    "intro": "Paeonia peregrina proles paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical traveler peony, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant belongs to the\u828d\u836f\u79d1 (Papaveraceae) family and is characterized by its striking, large, and often fragrant flowers. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy petals in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to ensure proper flowering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
