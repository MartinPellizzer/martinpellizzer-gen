    "intro": "Pilosella cymosoides, commonly known as the clustered pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pilosella cymosoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
