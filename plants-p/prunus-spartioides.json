    "intro": "Prunus spartioides, commonly known as the rock almond or spartioid cherry, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, often clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, almond-like fruits that are typically edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Prunus spartioides is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
