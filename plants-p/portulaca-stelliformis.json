    "intro": "Portulaca stelliformis, commonly known as the star moss or star flower, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to dry environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
