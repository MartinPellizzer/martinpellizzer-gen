    "intro": "Persicaria fluitans, commonly known as water pepper, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Persicaria fluitans is adapted to thrive in moist soils and can tolerate partial submersion, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
