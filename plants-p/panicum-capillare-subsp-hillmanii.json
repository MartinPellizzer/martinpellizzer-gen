    "intro": "Panicum capillare subsp. hillmanii, commonly known as hillman's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, pale green to brown spikelets. It is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
