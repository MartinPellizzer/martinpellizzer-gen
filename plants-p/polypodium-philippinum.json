    "intro": "Polypodium philippinum, commonly known as the Philippine holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking ornamental plant."
