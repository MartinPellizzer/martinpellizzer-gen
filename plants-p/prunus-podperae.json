    "intro": "Prunus podperae, commonly known as the Canary Island cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red or orange fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
