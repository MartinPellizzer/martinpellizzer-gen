    "intro": "Panicum insulicola, commonly known as the island panicgrass, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It is typically found in disturbed soils and coastal areas, thriving in environments with high salinity and sandy substrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
