It is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa, characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Peristrophe transvaalensis is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
