    "intro": "Pedicularis densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
