    "intro": "Paepalanthus paramensis, commonly known as the Paramense Bursera, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its bark contains aromatic resins, which have been used traditionally in some indigenous communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
