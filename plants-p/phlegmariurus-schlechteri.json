    "intro": "Phlegmariurus schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's clubmoss, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to substrates such as bark or rock. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green or brown coloration, often with distinct, irregular patterns on its surface. It is typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on shaded, moist surfaces. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized lichen species."
