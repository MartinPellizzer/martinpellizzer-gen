    "intro": "Peperomia fragrantissima, commonly known as the sweet pepper plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It features compact, upright growth with glossy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling tiny peppers. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Peperomia fragrantissima is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, spicy scent when touched."
