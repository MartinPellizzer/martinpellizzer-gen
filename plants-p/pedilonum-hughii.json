    "intro": "Pedilonum hughii, commonly known as the Hugh's pedilonum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a slightly serrated edge, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedilonum hughii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
