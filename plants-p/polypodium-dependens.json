    "intro": "Polypodium dependens, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense, hanging structure. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium dependens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
