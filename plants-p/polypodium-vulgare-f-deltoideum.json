    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. deltoideum, commonly known as the delta fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, deltoid-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The fronds are usually green, with a slightly glossy surface, and produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves."
