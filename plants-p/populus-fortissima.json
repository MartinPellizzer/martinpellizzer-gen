    "intro": "Populus fortissima, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Its bark is smooth and pale, often exuding a milky sap when injured. Populus fortissima is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
