    "intro": "Pitcairnia vallisoletana, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the rainforest canopy. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
