    "intro": "Parkia sylvatica, commonly known as the African sycamore or African sycamore tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and produces yellow-orange pods that contain edible seeds. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can grow in a variety of habitats, including forests and riverine areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it relies on insect pollination. The plant has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to windthrow but adaptable to disturbed environments."
