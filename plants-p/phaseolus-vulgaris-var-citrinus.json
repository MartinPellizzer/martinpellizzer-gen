    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. citrinus, commonly known as the golden bean or yellow kidney bean, is a variant of the common bean species. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow to orange pod and seeds, which are typically smaller than standard kidney beans. The plant is an annual legume that thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It produces trifoliate leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible seeds. This variety is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting subsequent crops."
