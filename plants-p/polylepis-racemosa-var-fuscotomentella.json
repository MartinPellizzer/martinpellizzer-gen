    "intro": "Polylepis racemosa var. fuscotomentella, commonly known as the Andean waxtree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and elongated, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in the arid conditions of its habitat. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various Andean species."
