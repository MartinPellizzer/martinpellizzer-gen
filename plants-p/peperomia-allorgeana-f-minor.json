It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green with a slightly textured surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
