    "intro": "Polypodium murudense, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in moist forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Polypodium murudense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
