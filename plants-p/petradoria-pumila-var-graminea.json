    "intro": "Petradoria pumila var. graminea, commonly known as the dwarf sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically thrives in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually white or pale blue, blooming in the summer months. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
