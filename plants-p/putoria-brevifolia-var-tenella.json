    "intro": "Putoria brevifolia var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved putoria, is a rare variant of the putoria genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a slightly aromatic scent, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
