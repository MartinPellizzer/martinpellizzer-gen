It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters during late spring, typically before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a glossy green upper surface. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
