    "intro": "Poinsettia geniculata, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers, surrounding a cluster of small, yellowish true flowers. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, also known as the spurge family, and is known for its ability to thrive in warm, sunny environments. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant, particularly during the holiday season. Poinsettia geniculata is also notable for its ability to adapt to various soil types, making it relatively easy to grow in both indoor and outdoor settings."
