    "intro": "Pilocereus colombianus, commonly known as the Colombian night bloomer, is a cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Colombia. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems and produces showy, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers open in the evening and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators like moths. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
