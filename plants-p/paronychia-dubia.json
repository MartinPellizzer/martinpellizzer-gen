    "intro": "Paronychia dubia, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are generally fleshy and can store water, which helps it survive in dry conditions. Paronychia dubia is a perennial species that produces white or pale pink flowers, often blooming in late spring or early summer."
