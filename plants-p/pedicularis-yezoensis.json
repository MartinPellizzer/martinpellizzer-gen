    "intro": "Pedicularis yezoensis, commonly known as the Yezo lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from red to purple, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Pedicularis yezoensis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
