    "intro": "Plectronia levinei, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can become invasive in certain environments. Plectronia levinei is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
