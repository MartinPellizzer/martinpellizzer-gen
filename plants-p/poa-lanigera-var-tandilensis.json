    "intro": "Poa lanigera var. tandilensis, commonly known as the Tandil hairgrass, is a grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
