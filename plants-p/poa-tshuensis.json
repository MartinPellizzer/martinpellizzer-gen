    "intro": "Poa tshuensis, commonly known as the Tshuensky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, Poa tshuensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
