    "intro": "Polystichum nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, unbranched fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum nudicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
