    "intro": "Potentilla hirta var. pedata, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided into five oval-shaped lobes, which are covered in fine hairs as well. This variety is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
