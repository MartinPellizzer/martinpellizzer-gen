    "intro": "Pilea obscura var. pharangii, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial with a unique rosette-shaped growth pattern. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a fine, powdery white coating, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Native to Southeast Asia, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
