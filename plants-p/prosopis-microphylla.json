    "intro": "Prosopis microphylla, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, bean-like pods and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deep underground. It produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The wood is hard and durable, making it useful for construction and fuel in some regions."
