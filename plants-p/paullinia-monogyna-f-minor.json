    "intro": "Paullinia monogyna f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf paullinia, is a compact shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
