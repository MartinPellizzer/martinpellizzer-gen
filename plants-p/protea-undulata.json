    "intro": "Protea undulata, commonly known as the undulating protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous petal-like bracts that form a spherical or conical shape. The plant typically grows in fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained soils and Mediterranean climates. Its flowers come in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a distinctive undulating pattern on the bracts. Protea undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
