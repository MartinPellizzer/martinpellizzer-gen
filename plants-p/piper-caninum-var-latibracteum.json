    "intro": "Piper caninum var. latibracteum, commonly known as the broad-bract pepper plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, opposite leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by oval, woody fruits that contain aromatic seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The varietal name \"latibracteum\" refers to the broad, fleshy bracts that surround its flowers, distinguishing it from other Piper species."
