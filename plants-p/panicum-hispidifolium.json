    "intro": "Panicum hispidifolium, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, rough-textured leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and disturbed areas. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
