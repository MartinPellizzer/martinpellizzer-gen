    "intro": "Pavonia virginica, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
