    "intro": "Punjuba racemiflora, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and often have a subtle fragrance. The plant has palmate leaves with a rough texture and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
