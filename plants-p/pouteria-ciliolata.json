    "intro": "Pouteria ciliolata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which contains the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are commercially valuable. Pouteria ciliolata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
