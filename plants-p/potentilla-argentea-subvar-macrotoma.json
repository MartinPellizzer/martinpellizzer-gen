    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subvar. macrotoma, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
