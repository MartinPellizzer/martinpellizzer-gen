    "intro": "Phillyrea latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features simple, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Phillyrea latifolia is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, resinous scent. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
