    "intro": "Pteris grevilleana, commonly known as the Greville's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface. The fronds are usually bioluminescent and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
