    "intro": "Pleurophora saccocarpa, commonly known as the sac-capsule pleurophora, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America, particularly found in the eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a unique, sac-like structure that splits open to release the seeds. The botanical features of Pleurophora saccocarpa make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
