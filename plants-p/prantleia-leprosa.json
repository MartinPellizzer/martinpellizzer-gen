    "intro": "Prantleia leprosa, commonly known as the leprous prantle, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with leprosy, though this connection is more mythological than medical. Due to habitat loss, Prantleia leprosa is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
