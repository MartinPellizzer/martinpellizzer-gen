    "intro": "Pinus sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color and arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that mature over two years, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. The Siberian pine is valued for its durability and is often used in construction and as a source of timber."
