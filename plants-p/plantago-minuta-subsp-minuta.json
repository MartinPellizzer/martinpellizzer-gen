It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
