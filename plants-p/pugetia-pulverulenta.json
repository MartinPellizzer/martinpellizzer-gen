    "intro": "Pugetia pulverulenta, commonly known as the Powdered Pugetia, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its finely textured, powdery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pugetia pulverulenta is considered a vulnerable species."
