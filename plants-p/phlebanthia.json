    "intro": "Phlebanthia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring long, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower that often resembles a ghostly figure. Native to the wetlands and bogs of Southeast Asia, Phlebanthia thrives in humid, shaded environments with nutrient-poor soil. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Phlebanthia is considered a threatened species in many regions."
