    "intro": "Polygonum oliganthum, commonly known as the Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some regions. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits."
