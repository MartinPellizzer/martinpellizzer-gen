    "intro": "Pseudolobivia toralapana, commonly known as the Toralapana cactus, is a unique species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, spiny growth habit. The plant typically features a short, thick stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom during the warmer months and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pseudolobivia toralapana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
