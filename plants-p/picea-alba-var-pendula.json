    "intro": "Picea alba var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce tree characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This cultivar exhibits a distinctive, elegant appearance with long, pendulous shoots that give it a flowing, weeping form. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in cooler, moist climates. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically a silvery-white to pale green color, adding to its ornamental value. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique visual appeal and hardiness."
