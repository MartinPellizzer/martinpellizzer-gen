    "intro": "Ptychocaryum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their woody stems and milky sap. Ptychocaryum species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Ptychocaryum africanum and Ptychocaryum zanzibarensis, which are often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations, Ptychocaryum plants are of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
