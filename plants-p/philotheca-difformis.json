    "intro": "Philotheca difformis, commonly known as the variable philotheca, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Philotheca difformis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understorey environments."
