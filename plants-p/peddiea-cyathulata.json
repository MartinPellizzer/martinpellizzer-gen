    "intro": "Peddiea cyathulata, commonly known as the golden cup-mud plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, cup-shaped inflorescence that resembles a small bowl, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
