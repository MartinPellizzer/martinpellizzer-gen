It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and short, twisted stems. The foliage consists of small, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variety is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
