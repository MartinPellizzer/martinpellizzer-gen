    "intro": "Plagiogyria rotundipinnata, commonly known as the round-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its floating fronds that are divided into rounded, pinnate lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to purify water."
