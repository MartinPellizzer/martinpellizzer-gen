    "intro": "Porophyllum leiocarpum, commonly known as the whiteleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Porophyllum leiocarpum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
