    "intro": "Passiflora glabra, commonly known as the silky passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often consumed raw or used in culinary applications. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its common name. Passiflora glabra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported calming effects."
