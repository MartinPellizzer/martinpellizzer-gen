    "intro": "Podochilus penicillatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in a compact, cylindrical spike. Its rhizomes are used as a starch source, similar to traditional arrowroot. The leaves are elongated and narrow, often with a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
