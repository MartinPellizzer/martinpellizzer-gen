    "intro": "Phedimus subcapitatum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its harsh environment. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Phedimus subcapitatum is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
