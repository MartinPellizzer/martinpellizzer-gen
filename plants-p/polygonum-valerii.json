    "intro": "Polygonum valerii, commonly known as heartleaf knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
