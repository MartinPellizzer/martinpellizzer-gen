    "intro": "Palicourea huampamiensis, commonly known as Huampami's palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
