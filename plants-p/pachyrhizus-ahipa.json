    "intro": "Pachyrhizus ahipa, commonly known as the Andean bean, is a leguminous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its stout, tuberous roots that store nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are compound, with elongated leaflets that help reduce water loss. Pachyrhizus ahipa is valued for its edible roots and seeds, which are used in traditional Andean cuisine."
