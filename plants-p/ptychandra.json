It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, Ptychandra thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
