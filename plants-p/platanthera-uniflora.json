    "intro": "Platanthera uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of North America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, grass-like appearance, featuring a single, showy flower that is usually white or pale green. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its photosynthetic stems for energy. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
