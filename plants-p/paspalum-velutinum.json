    "intro": "Paspalum velutinum, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
