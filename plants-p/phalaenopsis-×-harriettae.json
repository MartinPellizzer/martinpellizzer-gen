    "intro": "Phalaenopsis \u00d7 harriettae, commonly known as the Harrietta's Phalaenopsis, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from various Phalaenopsis species. It is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting blooms that typically appear in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern."
