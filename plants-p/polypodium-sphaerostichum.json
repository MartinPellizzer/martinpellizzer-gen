    "intro": "Polypodium sphaerostichum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like structure formed by tightly clustered fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, where it thrives in humid climates. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, spiny appearance. Polypodium sphaerostichum reproduces through spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of its fronds."
