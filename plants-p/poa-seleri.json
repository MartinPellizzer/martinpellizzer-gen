    "intro": "Poa seleri, commonly known as seler's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Poa seleri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
