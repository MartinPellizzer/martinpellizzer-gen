    "intro": "Phymosia anomala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has pinnate leaves composed of several narrow, linear leaflets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Phymosia anomala is often used in coastal and dryland landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
