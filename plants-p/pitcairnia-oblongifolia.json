    "intro": "Pitcairnia oblongifolia, commonly known as the \"Beware of the Dog\" plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears vibrant, long-lasting orange-red flowers. The plant's rosette of narrow, waxy leaves forms a water-holding cup, which supports a unique ecosystem for small organisms. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is a symbol of the biodiversity of the Brazilian rainforest."
