    "intro": "Potentilla isomera, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Potentilla isomera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or alpine settings."
