    "intro": "Primula nivalis macrophylla, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which provide protection against freezing temperatures and UV radiation. Primula nivalis macrophylla is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
