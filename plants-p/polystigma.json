    "intro": "Polystigma, commonly known as the \"white clover\" in some regions, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, spherical flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Polystigma species are often found in temperate climates and are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making them valuable in soil enrichment. These plants are also commonly used in forage and as cover crops due to their hardiness and rapid growth. Their botanical features make them important in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
