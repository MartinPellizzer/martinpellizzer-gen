    "intro": "Pteris gongalensis, commonly known as the Gongalens fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern."
