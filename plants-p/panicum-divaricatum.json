    "intro": "Panicum divaricatum, commonly known as dwarf dropseed, is a grass species native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale green to brown flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for native plant gardens. Panicum divaricatum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in natural landscapes."
