    "intro": "Peperomia corcovadensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are broader than typical peperomia varieties, often with a glossy surface and prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in both home and office settings."
