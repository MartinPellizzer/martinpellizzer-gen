    "intro": "Pleiospermium, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often silver- or gray-green colored leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which is a defining feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Pleiospermium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and have ornamental value due to their unique foliage."
