    "intro": "Pharus virescens, commonly known as the green pharus, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are a deep green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, which bloom during the wet season. Pharus virescens thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
