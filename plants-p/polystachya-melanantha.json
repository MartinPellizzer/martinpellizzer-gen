It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that are often dark green or black in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces clustered inflorescences of small, greenish or yellowish flowers, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystachya melanantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
