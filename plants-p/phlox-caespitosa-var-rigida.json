    "intro": "Phlox caespitosa var. rigida, commonly known as rigid marsh phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features upright, clump-forming stems that bear whorled clusters of fragrant, pink to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate water conditions."
