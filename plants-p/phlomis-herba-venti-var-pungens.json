    "intro": "Phlomis herba-venti var. pungens, commonly known as the spiked phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, spiky flower clusters in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
