    "intro": "Pellaea spiculata, commonly known as the spiny pellaea, is a perennial fern native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a modified leaf called an indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Pellaea spiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
