    "intro": "Polygala transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas and has a slender, erect stem with opposite leaves. Its flowers are clustered in spicate inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that release seeds through a mechanism similar to a catapult. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
