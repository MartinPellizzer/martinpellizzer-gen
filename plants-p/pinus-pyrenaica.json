    "intro": "Pinus pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree produces cones that are usually 5 to 8 centimeters in length, containing winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. This species plays an important ecological role in mountainous ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to forest structure."
