    "intro": "Portulaca coralloides, commonly known as coral bead purslane, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that resemble coral beads, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are small, thick, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Portulaca coralloides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
