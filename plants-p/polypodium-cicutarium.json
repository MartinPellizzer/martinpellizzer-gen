    "intro": "Polypodium cicutarium, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and ability to grow without soil make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
