    "intro": "Palma major, commonly known as the giant fan palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant has a robust trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and can grow up to 20 meters tall. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in moist, well-drained soils. Palma major is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
