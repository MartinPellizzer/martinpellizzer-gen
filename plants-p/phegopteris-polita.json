    "intro": "Phegopteris polita, commonly known as the silky cliffbrake, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a soft, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Phegopteris polita plays a role in stabilizing soil on steep terrain and supports local biodiversity."
