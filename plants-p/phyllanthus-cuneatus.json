    "intro": "Phyllanthus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing shrub or herb with small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Phyllanthus cuneatus is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
