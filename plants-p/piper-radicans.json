It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as black pepper. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into three-chambered berries containing a single seed. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a mildly spicy scent when crushed. Piper radicans is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
