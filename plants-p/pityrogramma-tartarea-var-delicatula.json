    "intro": "Pityrogramma tartarea var. delicatula, commonly known as the delicate water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical regions. It is a small, aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and sometimes have a bluish tinge. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
