It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal environments, such as sandy shores and dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Pukateria littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native insects."
