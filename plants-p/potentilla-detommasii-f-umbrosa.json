    "intro": "Potentilla detommasii f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant collections. This variety is particularly noted for its adaptability to cooler, humid climates."
