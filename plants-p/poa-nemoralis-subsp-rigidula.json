    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. rigidula, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are often slightly drooping. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
