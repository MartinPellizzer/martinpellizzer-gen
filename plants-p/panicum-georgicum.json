    "intro": "Panicum georgicum, commonly known as Georgia dropseed, is a native grass species of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of pale to golden brown flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
