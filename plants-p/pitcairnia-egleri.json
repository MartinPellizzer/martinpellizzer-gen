    "intro": "Pitcairnia egleri, commonly known as the velvet leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety green leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a compact and visually appealing structure. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear clusters of showy, tubular red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
