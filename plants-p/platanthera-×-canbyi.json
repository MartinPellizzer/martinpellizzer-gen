    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 canbyi, commonly known as the Canby's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, erect stem and a single, small, greenish-white flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in many parts of its range."
