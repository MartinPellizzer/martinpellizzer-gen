It features small, glossy, dark green leaves with a silvery underside, giving it a striking visual contrast. The plant produces tiny, pale green flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in moderate light conditions. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in both gardens and indoor spaces."
