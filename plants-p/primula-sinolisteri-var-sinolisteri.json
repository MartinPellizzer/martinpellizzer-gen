It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
