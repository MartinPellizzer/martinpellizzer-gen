    "intro": "Pentropis, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plants are native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in mountainous environments. Pentropis species are often found in moist, well-drained soils and can grow in both full sun and partial shade. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
