    "intro": "Pterostylis banksii, commonly known as the Banks' helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped flower that resembles a small helmet, typically green with a brownish cap. The plant grows from a rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a single flower at the apex. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. The orchid is pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, which are attracted to its unique floral structure."
