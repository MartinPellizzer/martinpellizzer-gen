    "intro": "Pelargonium lobatum, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often lobed or notched. The plant produces clusters of bright pink or red flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
