    "intro": "Polypodium purpusii, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that typically measure between 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and serve as the primary means of vegetative propagation. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in rows along the veins."
