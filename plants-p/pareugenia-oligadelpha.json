    "intro": "Pareugenia oligadelpha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
