    "intro": "Pleurothallis vieirae, commonly known as the Vieira's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a subtle pinkish tinge. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for efficient water absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
