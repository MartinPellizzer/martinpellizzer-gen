    "intro": "Phacelia austromontana, commonly known as the Sierra phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Phacelia austromontana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological value."
