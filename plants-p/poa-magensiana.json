    "intro": "Poa magensiana, commonly known as the Magens Island grass, is a species of grass native to the remote Magens Island in the South Pacific. It is a low-growing, tufted perennial that thrives in moist, coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils, making it resilient to harsh coastal conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
