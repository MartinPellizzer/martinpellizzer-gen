    "intro": "Polypodium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
