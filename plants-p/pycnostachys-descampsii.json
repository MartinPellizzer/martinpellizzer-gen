It features vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, with intricate patterns resembling stars. The plant has a compact growth habit, with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
