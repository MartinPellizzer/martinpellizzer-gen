    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. inclinata, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
