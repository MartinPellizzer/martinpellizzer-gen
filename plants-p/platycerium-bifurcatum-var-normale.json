    "intro": "Platycerium bifurcatum var. normale, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the plant's rhizome, giving it a striking, tree-like appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its unusual morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
