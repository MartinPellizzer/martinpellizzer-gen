    "intro": "Pedicularis hamata, commonly known as the spiked monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. It typically blooms in late summer and is appreciated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
