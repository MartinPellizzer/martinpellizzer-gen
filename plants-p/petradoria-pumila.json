    "intro": "Petradoria pumila, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a basal rosette structure, allowing it to store water efficiently in its leaves and stems. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Petradoria pumila is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices."
