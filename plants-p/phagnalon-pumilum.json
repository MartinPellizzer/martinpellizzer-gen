    "intro": "Phagnalon pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf phagnalon, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
