    "intro": "Pyrus pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Pannonian Basin in Central Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by pear-shaped fruits that ripen in late summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for its edible fruit in some regions."
