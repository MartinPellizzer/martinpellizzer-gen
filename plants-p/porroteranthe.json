    "intro": "Porroteranthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and striking, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique epiphyte. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Porroteranthe is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
