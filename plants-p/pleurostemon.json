    "intro": "Pleurostemon, commonly known as the narrowleaf styrax, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Styracaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves, which are usually glossy and dark green. They produce small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
