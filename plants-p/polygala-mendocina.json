    "intro": "Polygala mendocina, commonly known as Mendocino milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
