    "intro": "Pedicularis gracilis subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
