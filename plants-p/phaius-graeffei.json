    "intro": "Phaius graeffei, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal climates. The flowers bloom in summer, adding vibrant color to gardens and natural habitats."
