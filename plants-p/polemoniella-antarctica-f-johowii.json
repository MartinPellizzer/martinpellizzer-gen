    "intro": "Polemoniella antarctica f. johowii, commonly known as the Antarctic polemonium, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to the high-altitude regions of Antarctica. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in the brief summer months. The plant exhibits a low-growing, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve heat and moisture in its extreme environment. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing additional insulation against the harsh climate. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to survive in one of the most extreme environments on Earth."
