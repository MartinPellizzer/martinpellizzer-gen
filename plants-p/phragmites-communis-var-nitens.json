    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. nitens, commonly known as the nitens reed, is a variant of the common reed that is native to wetland environments in North America. It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in dense stands along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
