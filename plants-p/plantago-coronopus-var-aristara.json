    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. aristara, commonly known as the spiked plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces upright flowering stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, bracted inflorescence, which gives it its common name."
