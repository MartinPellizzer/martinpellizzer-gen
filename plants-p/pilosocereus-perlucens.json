    "intro": "Pilosocereus perlucens, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often brightly colored upper stem, which is actually a graft of a different cactus species. The lower part of the plant, known as the rootstock, is typically a pale, almost white color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The plant is also noted for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments."
