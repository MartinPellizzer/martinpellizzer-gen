    "intro": "Pimpinella turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkestan cow-wheat, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has pinnately divided leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the genus Pimpinella."
