    "intro": "Polypodium solidum var. bolanicum, commonly known as the Bolan fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that form a compact rosette, with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
