    "intro": "Passerina ammodendron, commonly known as the desert sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by local wildlife. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Passerina ammodendron plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
