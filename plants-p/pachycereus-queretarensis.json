    "intro": "Pachycereus queretarensis, commonly known as the Quer\u00e9taro prickly pear, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features a tall, unbranched stem with a ribbed structure that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a \"tuna,\" is edible and has a sweet, fleshy pulp. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
