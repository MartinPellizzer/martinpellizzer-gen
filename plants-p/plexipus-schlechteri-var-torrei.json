    "intro": "Plexipus schlechteri var. torrei, commonly known as the Torre's plexipus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by ornamental, fleshy fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
