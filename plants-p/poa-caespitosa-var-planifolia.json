    "intro": "Poa caespitosa var. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and flat, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous, with florets that are pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its low-growing nature and ability to form dense mats, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
