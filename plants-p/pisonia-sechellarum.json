    "intro": "Pisonia sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in soft, white hairs. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Pisonia sechellarum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
