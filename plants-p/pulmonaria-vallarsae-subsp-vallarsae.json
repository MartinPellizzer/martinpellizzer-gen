    "intro": "Pulmonaria vallarsae subsp. vallarsae, commonly known as the Alpine lungwort, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
