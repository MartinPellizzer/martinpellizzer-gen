    "intro": "Polygonum lapathifolium var. punctatum, commonly known as spotted knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive purple veins and red-tinged stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
