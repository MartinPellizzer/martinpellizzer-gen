    "intro": "Pleurothallis sanctae-rosae, commonly known as the Santa Rosa pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered rare and is often found in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions."
