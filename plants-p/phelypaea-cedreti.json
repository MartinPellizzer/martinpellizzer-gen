    "intro": "Phelypaea cedreti, commonly known as the cedrela fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Phelypaea cedreti is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to add a lush, green element to shaded gardens."
