    "intro": "Phlebiophragmus, commonly known as the false coral fungus, is a type of basidiomycete fungus belonging to the family Phlebiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, coral-like fruiting bodies that often grow on decaying wood. The genus Phlebiophragmus is distinguished by its unique structure, featuring a network of delicate, branching hyphae that form a gelatinous matrix. These fungi play an important ecological role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems. They are typically found in temperate regions and are often associated with hardwood trees."
