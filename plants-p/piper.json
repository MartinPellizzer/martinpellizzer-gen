    "intro": "Piper, commonly known as pepper, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Piperaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their distinctive, often aromatic leaves. Many species within the genus produce small, berry-like fruits that are used as spices, with Piper nigrum being the source of black pepper. The plants typically have opposite leaves and produce small, green flowers that develop into the familiar pepper fruits. Piper species are widely cultivated for their culinary and medicinal uses."
