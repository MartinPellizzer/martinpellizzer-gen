    "intro": "Paronychia capensis, commonly known as the Cape sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and linear, succulent leaves. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting features such as reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Paronychia capensis is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to coastal and inland regions with limited rainfall."
