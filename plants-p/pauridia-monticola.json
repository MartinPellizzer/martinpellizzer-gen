It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Pauridia monticola is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
