    "intro": "Psilocaulon longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed coralroot, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which provide the necessary nutrients for its survival. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Psilocaulon longipes is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
