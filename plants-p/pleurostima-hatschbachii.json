    "intro": "Pleurostima hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's pleurostima, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and small, clustered inflorescences that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
