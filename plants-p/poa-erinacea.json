    "intro": "Poa erinacea, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Poa erinacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various ecological settings."
