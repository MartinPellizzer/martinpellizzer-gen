    "intro": "Prunus padus f. purdomii, commonly known as the white-flowered bird cherry, is a rare and distinctive variant of the bird cherry species. It is characterized by its white blossoms, which contrast strikingly with its dark, peeling bark. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the fruit is a small, yellowish drupe. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
