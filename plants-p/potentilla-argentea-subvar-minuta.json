    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subvar. minuta, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
