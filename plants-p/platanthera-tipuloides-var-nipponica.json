It features a tall, slender stem with a dense inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs that store nutrients. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance."
