    "intro": "Picea mariana f. ericoides, commonly known as the Ericoid Form of the Black Spruce, is a variant of the black spruce native to northern regions of North America. This form is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that resemble those of ericaceous plants. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forest ecosystems. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
