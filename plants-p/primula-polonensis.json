    "intro": "Primula polonensis, commonly known as the Polish primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Primula polonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
