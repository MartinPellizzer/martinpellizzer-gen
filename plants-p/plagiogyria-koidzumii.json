    "intro": "Plagiogyria koidzumii, commonly known as the Koidzumi's plagiogyria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
