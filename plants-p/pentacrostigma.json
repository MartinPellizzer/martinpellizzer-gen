    "intro": "Pentacrostigma, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, compound leaves, and small, often yellow or white flowers. They are valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, many species are threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
