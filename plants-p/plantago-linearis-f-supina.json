    "intro": "Plantago linearis f. supina, commonly known as the prostrate plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes that emerge from the base of the leaves. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
