    "intro": "Pandaca ciliata var. sambiranensis, commonly known as the Sambiranensis pandaca, is a rare and unique variant of the pandaca species. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves with fine, ciliate margins, which give it its scientific name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
