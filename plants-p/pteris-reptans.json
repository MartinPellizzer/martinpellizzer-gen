It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive blackish vein pattern on the underside. Pteris reptans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
