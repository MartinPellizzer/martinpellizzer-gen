    "intro": "Psorothamnus arborescens var. californicus, commonly known as the California greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in poor, well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for desert wildlife."
