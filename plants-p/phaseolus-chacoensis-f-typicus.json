    "intro": "Phaseolus chacoensis f. typicus, commonly known as the Chaco bean, is a wild legume native to South America, particularly found in Paraguay and northern Argentina. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with small, pale green to yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, narrow pods containing small, yellowish seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving bean crops."
