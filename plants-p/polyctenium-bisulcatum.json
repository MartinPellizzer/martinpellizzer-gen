    "intro": "Polyctenium bisulcatum, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
