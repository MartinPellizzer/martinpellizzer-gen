It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, feathery inflorescence that resembles a ghostly silhouette. The plant is highly adapted to drought conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
