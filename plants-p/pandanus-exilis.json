    "intro": "Pandanus exilis, commonly known as the bottlebrush palm, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, brush-like crown. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which resemble bottle brushes, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a fibrous, spiky structure that contains edible seeds. Pandanus exilis is often used in traditional crafts and for its ornamental value in landscaping."
