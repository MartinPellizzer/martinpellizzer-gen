    "intro": "Potentilla sericata, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Potentilla sericata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
