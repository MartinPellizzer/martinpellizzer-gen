It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds.
