    "intro": "Polygonum sclerophloeum, commonly known as the hard-shelled knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
