    "intro": "Pernettya obovata, commonly known as the oval cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in early summer, followed by edible, dark red berries that are popular among birds and small mammals. Its leaves are oval-shaped, leathery, and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. Pernettya obovata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes."
