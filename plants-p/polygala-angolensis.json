    "intro": "Polygala angolensis, commonly known as the Angola milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers, which can be yellow, white, or pink, are pollinated by insects and produce small, dry fruits containing seeds."
