    "intro": "Parnassia longipetala var. brevipetala, commonly known as the short-petalled parnassia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers with prominent yellow markings, which are often mistaken for orchids due to their elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest understories, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a smooth margin, and the plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The species is noted for its delicate structure and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
