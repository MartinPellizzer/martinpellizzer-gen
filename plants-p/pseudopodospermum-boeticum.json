    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum boeticum, commonly known as the Canary Island date palm, is a flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits resembling dates. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
