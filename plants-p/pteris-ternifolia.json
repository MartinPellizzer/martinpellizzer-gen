    "intro": "Pteris ternifolia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are divided into pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in wetlands and gardens. Pteris ternifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
