    "intro": "Pinanga leonardcoi, commonly known as the Leonard's bamboo, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. It produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are enclosed within a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, Pinanga leonardcoi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
