    "intro": "Polypodium schumannianum, commonly known as the Schumann's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself securely to its host. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves."
