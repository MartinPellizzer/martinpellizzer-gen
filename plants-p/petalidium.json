It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of the pomegranate. Their leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the fruits are usually small, round, and covered in a fleshy, sometimes spiny exterior. Petalidium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in various cultures."
