It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
