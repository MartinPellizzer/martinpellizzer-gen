    "intro": "Picea pungens var. glauca, commonly known as the Colorado blue spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which results from a dense layer of wax on the needles. The plant has a conical shape with a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its cones are typically cylindrical and contain two winged seeds, typical of the coniferous family. The tree is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
