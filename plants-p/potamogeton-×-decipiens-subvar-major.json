    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 decipiens subvar. major, commonly known as the greater pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length and 1\u20132 cm wide. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
