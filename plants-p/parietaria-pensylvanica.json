    "intro": "Parietaria pensylvanica, commonly known as the common ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features heart-shaped, slightly hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it a common weed in gardens and lawns. Botanically, it is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively, and its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
