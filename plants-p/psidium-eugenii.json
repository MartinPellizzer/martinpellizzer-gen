    "intro": "Psidium eugenii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe, with a sweet and aromatic flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Psidium genus."
