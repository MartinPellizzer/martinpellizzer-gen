    "intro": "Phleum stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping barleygrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
