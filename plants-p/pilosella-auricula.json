    "intro": "Pilosella auricula, commonly known as the auricled mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and finely divided leaves. The plant features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage with hairy surfaces, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in summer and are followed by small, oval-shaped achenes. Pilosella auricula thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
