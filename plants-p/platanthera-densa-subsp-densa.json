    "intro": "Platanthera densa subsp. densa, commonly known as the dense orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often near streams or in damp soil. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many areas."
