    "intro": "Potentilla fallacina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
