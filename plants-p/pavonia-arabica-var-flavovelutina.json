    "intro": "Pavonia arabica var. flavovelutina, commonly known as the golden velvet pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its showy, bright yellow to orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. The leaves are usually covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving the plant its common name."
