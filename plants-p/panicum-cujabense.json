    "intro": "Panicum cujabense, commonly known as the Cujabense grass, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open areas and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage crop."
