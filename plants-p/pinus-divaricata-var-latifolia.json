    "intro": "Pinus divaricata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lodgepole pine, is a variant of the lodgepole pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broader, more flattened needles compared to the typical lodgepole pine, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows in high-elevation forests and is adapted to cold, dry environments. Its cones are often serotinous, meaning they remain closed until heated by fire, ensuring seed dispersal after forest fires. This variety plays an important ecological role in mountainous ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
