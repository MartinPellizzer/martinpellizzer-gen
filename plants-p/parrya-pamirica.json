    "intro": "Parrya pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Parrya pamirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
