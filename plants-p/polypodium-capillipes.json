    "intro": "Polypodium capillipes, commonly known as the slender hart's-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which give it its scientific name. Polypodium capillipes is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
