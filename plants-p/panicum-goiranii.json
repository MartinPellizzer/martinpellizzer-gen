    "intro": "Panicum goiranii, commonly known as the Goiran grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Panicum goiranii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in open grasslands and disturbed soils."
