    "intro": "Polylepis brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved polylepis, is a species of tree found in the Andean highlands. It is characterized by its dense, broad leaves and can grow up to 20 meters in height. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. It plays a vital role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
