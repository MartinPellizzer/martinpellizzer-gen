    "intro": "Plantago humilis subsp. sarda, commonly known as the Sardinian plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a resilient plant in arid conditions."
