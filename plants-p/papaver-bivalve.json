    "intro": "Papaver bivalve, commonly known as the two-valved poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically have two lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces capsule fruits that split open to release its seeds, a feature typical of many poppy species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant's botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant."
