    "intro": "Protea coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant typically grows in fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun exposure. Its unique floral structure makes it a popular choice for cut flower arrangements. Protea coarctata is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and birds."
