It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its clustered, heart-shaped leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
