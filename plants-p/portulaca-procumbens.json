    "intro": "Portulaca procumbens, commonly known as the moss rose or carpet flower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that forms dense mats of foliage, with fleshy, thick leaves that store water. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, opposite leaves, and a preference for well-drained soil. Portulaca procumbens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and vibrant floral display."
