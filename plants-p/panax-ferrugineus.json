    "intro": "Panax ferrugineus, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red panax, is a rare and endangered plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its medicinal properties have made it highly sought after, leading to overharvesting and habitat loss. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
