    "intro": "Pyrus montana, commonly known as the mountain ash or whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers in spring. The tree produces small, edible fruits known as rowans, which are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have serrated edges, turning yellow or red in autumn. Pyrus montana is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
