    "intro": "Polygala erioptera, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
