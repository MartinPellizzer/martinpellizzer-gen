    "intro": "Pastinaca aspera, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are cylindrical and often have a strong, spicy odor, similar to that of parsnips. Wild parsnip is known for its phototoxic sap, which can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
