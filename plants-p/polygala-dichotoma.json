    "intro": "Polygala dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala dichotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
