    "intro": "Psychotria porphyroclada, commonly known as the red-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking dark red to almost black leaves, which contrast with its small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
