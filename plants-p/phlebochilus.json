    "intro": "Phlebochilus, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The flowers are typically blue or purple, with three petals and three sepals, giving them a distinctive appearance. Phlebochilus species are often found in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. They play an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
