    "intro": "Phleum arenarium f. majus, commonly known as the greater silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky texture and pale blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Phleum arenarium f. majus is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in low-nutrient environments."
