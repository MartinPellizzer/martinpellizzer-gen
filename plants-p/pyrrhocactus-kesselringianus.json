    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus kesselringianus, commonly known as the Kesselringian fire cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright red or orange spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
