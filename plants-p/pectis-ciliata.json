    "intro": "Pectis ciliata, commonly known as the fringed pectis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, yellow flowers arranged in a flat, disc-like structure, typical of the family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or fuzzy appearance, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Pectis ciliata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
