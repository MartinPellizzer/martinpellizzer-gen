The tree produces cones that are usually reddish-brown and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. This hybrid species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly planted in gardens and parks."
