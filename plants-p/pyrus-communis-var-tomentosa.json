    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly apple or tomentosa pear, is a variety of the common pear that is characterized by its dense, white pubescence covering the stems and leaves. This pubescence, or tomentum, gives the plant a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are usually oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruit. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique texture, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes."
