    "intro": "Polystichum nervosum, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with prominent, visible veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or forested substrates. Polystichum nervosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, decorative foliage."
