    "intro": "Picea asperata var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden spruce, is a rare variant of the silver fir native to the mountainous regions of China. This variety is distinguished by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical dark green of the species. The leaves are short, stiff, and covered in a fine layer of wax, giving them a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. It is a slow-growing tree that thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
