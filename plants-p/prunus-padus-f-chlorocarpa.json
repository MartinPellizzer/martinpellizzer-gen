    "intro": "Prunus padus f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-leafed bird cherry, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a hybrid form of Prunus padus, characterized by its distinctive green foliage rather than the typical reddish or yellowish leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that matures in late summer. This variety is often found in moist, shady woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance."
