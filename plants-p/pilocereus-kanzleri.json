    "intro": "Pilocereus kanzleri, commonly known as the Kanzler's night bloomer, is a cactus native to Brazil. It is a low-growing, sprawling plant with thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert environments. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers that are usually white or pale pink, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid climates."
