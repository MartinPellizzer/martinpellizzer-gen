    "intro": "Pilosocereus gruberi, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rapid water absorption. Pilosocereus gruberi is a slow-growing plant with a long lifespan, often reaching several meters in height."
