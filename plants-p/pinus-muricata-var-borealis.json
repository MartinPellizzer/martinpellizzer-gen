    "intro": "Pinus muricata var. borealis, commonly known as the Alaska white pine, is a variant of the white pine species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The tree produces cones that are elongated and often have a resinous scent, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. It thrives in cooler climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils, often found in mountainous or coastal regions. This variant is valued for its timber and is also an important species for wildlife habitat and forest biodiversity."
