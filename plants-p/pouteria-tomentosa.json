    "intro": "Pouteria tomentosa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces large, woody fruits that contain a single, large seed, which is the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. The plant has a dense, fibrous bark and is often found in humid, lowland rainforests. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its ornamental and economic significance."
