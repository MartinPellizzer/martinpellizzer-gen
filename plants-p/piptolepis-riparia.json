    "intro": "Piptolepis riparia, commonly known as the riverbank thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wetlands and riverbanks of southern Africa. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil along water edges. Piptolepis riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
