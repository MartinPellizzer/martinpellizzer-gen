    "intro": "Potentilla ctenophora, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are alternate, with five to seven leaflets, and the stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. Potentilla ctenophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and bright floral display."
