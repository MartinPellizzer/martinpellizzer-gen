    "intro": "Physalis latecorollata, commonly known as the late corolla physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflated calyx that encloses the fruit, which resembles a small, yellow-orange lantern. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is native to regions of North America. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with five petals that open late in the day. The fruit, which matures in late summer to early fall, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor."
