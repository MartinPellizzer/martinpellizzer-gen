    "intro": "Pennisetum asperifolium, commonly known as blue oat grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It features slender, upright stems that produce panicles of blue-gray flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive silver-blue hue on their upper surface. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This plant is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for beneficial insects."
