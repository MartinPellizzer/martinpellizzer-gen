    "intro": "Pitcairnia aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and can vary in color depending on light exposure. Pitcairnia aequatorialis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in its native habitat."
