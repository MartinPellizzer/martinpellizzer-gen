It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. The golden potentilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
