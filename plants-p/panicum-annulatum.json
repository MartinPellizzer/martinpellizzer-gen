    "intro": "Panicum annulatum, commonly known as the ringgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
