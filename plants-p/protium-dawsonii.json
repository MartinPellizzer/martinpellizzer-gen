    "intro": "Protium dawsonii, commonly known as Dawson's sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Hispaniola, and is known for its distinctive, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by round, smooth fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and flaky, and the tree can grow up to 20 meters tall. Protium dawsonii plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
