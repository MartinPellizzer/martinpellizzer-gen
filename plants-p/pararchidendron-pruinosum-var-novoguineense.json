    "intro": "Pararchidendron pruinosum var. novoguineense, commonly known as the Guinean velvetwood, is a tropical tree species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, bark-like texture on its trunk. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface that gives it a distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in humid, lowland forest environments."
