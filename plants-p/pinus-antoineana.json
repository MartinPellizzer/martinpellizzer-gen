    "intro": "Pinus antoineana, commonly known as the Antoine pine, is a species of pine native to the mountainous regions of eastern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially yellowish-green but mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
