    "intro": "Polycarpon polycarpoides var. colomense, commonly known as the Colom\u00e9's polycarp, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, pinkish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
