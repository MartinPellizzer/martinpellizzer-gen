    "intro": "Pilgerina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. The plant's roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter. Pilgerina belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its striking appearance and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
