    "intro": "Pimpinella parishiana, commonly known as the Parish's cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with a taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
