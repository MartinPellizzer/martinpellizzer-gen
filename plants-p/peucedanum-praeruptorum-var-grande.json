It is native to China and is known for its tall, branched stems that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded units upon maturity. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a delicate appearance. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
