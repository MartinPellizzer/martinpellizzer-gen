    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia subsp. indica, commonly known as the Indian wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It features broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive, waxy appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more elongated flowers compared to the typical form of Pyrola rotundifolia."
