It is characterized by its distinctive horn-like structures on its fruiting bodies, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The species is notable for its unique morphological adaptations that enhance its survival in specific ecological niches."
