    "intro": "Physospermopsis muliensis, commonly known as the Muli physosperm, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Physostomataceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a specialized perianth that aids in pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are elongated and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Physospermopsis muliensis is considered a critically endangered species."
