    "intro": "Piper liesneri, commonly known as the red-veined pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into peppery, edible berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and mild peppery flavor, it is cultivated both for gardens and culinary use."
