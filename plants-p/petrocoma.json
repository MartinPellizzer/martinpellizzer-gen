    "intro": "Petrocoma, commonly known as the rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and often spiny leaves. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Petrocoma species produce small, yellow or white flowers that are often clustered in racemes. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
