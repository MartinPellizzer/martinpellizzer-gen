    "intro": "Plantago humilis subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island plantain, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to certain island regions. It typically features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
