It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant's leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that sets it apart from other ferns. Phenax edentatus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
