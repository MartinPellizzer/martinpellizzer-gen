    "intro": "Pagiantha subglobosa, commonly known as the globular pagiantha, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, subglobular shape, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
