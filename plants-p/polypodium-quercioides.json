    "intro": "Polypodium quercioides, commonly known as the oak fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a serrated, oak-like leaf shape, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium quercioides plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small organisms."
