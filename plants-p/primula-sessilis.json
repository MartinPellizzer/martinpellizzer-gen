It features basal leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often with a distinctive yellow throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch of color to the landscape."
