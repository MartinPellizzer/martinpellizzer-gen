    "intro": "Pistacia \u00d7 saportae, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant is notable for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some regions."
