    "intro": "Pteris websteri, commonly known as the webster's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Pteris websteri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
