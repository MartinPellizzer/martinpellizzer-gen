It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and attractive floral display."
