    "intro": "Polypodium tectum, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in forest understories. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are pinnately compound and often have a leathery texture. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Polypodium tectum is adapted to moist, humid conditions and is found in various regions across Asia, Africa, and the Americas."
