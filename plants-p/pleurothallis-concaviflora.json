    "intro": "Pleurothallis concaviflora, commonly known as the concave-flowered pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its preference for shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate petal structures. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
