    "intro": "Perymenium buphthalmoides var. tenellum, commonly known as the small-eyed perymenium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and distinctive yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions."
