    "intro": "Panicum bulbosum var. avenaceum, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is characterized by its bulbous base, which helps it survive in flooded conditions by storing nutrients and water."
