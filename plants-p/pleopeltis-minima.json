    "intro": "Pleopeltis minima, commonly known as the small pleopeltis, is a small epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Pleopeltis minima is prized in horticulture for its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
