    "intro": "Pilosella prussica subsp. scharlokiana, commonly known as the Prussian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting native plant communities."
