    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. nigra, commonly known as the black spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and conical shape, which helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and its needles are typically short and dark green. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forests and swampy areas. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
