    "intro": "Piper scabriseptum var. reductum, commonly known as the red-tailed pepper plant, is a variant of the scabrous seven-leaf pepper. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red, velvety calyces that enclose the small, peppercorn-like fruits. Its foliage consists of ovate to lanceolate leaves with a glossy surface and a strong, pungent aroma. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine and as a spice."
