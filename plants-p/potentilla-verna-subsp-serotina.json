    "intro": "Potentilla verna subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late flowering cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant features compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. It blooms later in the season compared to the typical P. verna, usually from June to August. The subspecies is distinguished by its delayed flowering and slightly different leaf morphology."
