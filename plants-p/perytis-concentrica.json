    "intro": "Perytis concentrica, commonly known as the concentric perytis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenia plants. The plant is characterized by its unique concentric patterns on its leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
