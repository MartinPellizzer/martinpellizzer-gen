    "intro": "Potentilla tommasiniana var. acclinis, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
