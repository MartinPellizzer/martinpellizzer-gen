    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia lusus trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf lady's tresses, is an orchid species native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rich, organic soils and thrives in woodland areas with high humidity. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
