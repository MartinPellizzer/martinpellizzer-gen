    "intro": "Peperomia rotundata var. anomala, commonly known as the Round-leaf Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
