    "intro": "Pandanus clandestinus, commonly known as the hidden pandanus, is a rare and elusive species of the Pandanus genus. It is characterized by its unique, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in coastal or forested areas. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are usually hidden among the foliage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
