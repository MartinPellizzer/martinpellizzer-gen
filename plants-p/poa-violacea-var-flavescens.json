It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that can turn yellowish under certain conditions. This variety is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native ecosystems."
