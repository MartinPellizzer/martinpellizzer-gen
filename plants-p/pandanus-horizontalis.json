    "intro": "Pandanus horizontalis, commonly known as the flat-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that grow horizontally along the stem, forming a dense, fan-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often used in traditional crafts. Its roots and leaves are sometimes utilized in local cuisines and medicinal practices. Pandanus horizontalis thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near water bodies."
