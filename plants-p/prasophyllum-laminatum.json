It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Prasophyllum laminatum is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in native landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
