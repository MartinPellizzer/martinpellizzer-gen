    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria divaricata subsp. attenuatiglumis, commonly known as the slender glume bluegrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, awnless glumes, which are distinctive features of the subspecies. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among grasses. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
