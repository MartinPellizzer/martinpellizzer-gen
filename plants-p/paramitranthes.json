    "intro": "Paramitranthes, commonly known as the Hawaiian puaiohi, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and stream banks. Paramitranthes has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
