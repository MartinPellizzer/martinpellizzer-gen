It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often vibrant flowers. The plant is characterized by its solitary, showy inflorescence that typically blooms in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pentameris uniflora is considered an endangered species."
