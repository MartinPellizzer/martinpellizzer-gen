    "intro": "Potentilla alba f. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf white cinquefoil, is a botanical variant of the white cinquefoil species. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that differ from the typical narrow leaves of the species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
