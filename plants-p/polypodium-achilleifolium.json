    "intro": "Polypodium achilleifolium, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology. The plant's ability to adapt to various substrates makes it a resilient and widely distributed species."
