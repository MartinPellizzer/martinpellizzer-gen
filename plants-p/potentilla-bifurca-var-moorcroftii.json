    "intro": "Potentilla bifurca var. moorcroftii, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its compact form and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate, with a serrated margin and a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine soils."
