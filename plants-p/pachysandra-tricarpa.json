    "intro": "Pachysandra tricarpa, commonly known as the three-lobed pachysandra, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with distinctive three-lobed leaves that provide a lush, ground-covering effect. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Pachysandra tricarpa is valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its low maintenance requirements in woodland gardens."
