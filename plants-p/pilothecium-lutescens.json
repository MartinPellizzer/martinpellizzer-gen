    "intro": "Pilothecium lutescens, commonly known as the yellow pilothecium, is a unique member of the Pilothecium genus, characterized by its distinctive yellowish to orange-colored sporocarps. It is a saprophytic plant, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant produces spores within its sporocarps, which are small, cup-shaped structures that aid in spore dispersal. Its morphology includes a basal stalk and a cup-like structure with a smooth, waxy surface. Pilothecium lutescens plays a minor role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem due to its decomposer activity."
