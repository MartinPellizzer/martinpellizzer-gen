It is characterized by its compact, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, which are essential for its reproduction. Its leaves are small and narrow, typically measuring less than 10 centimeters in length. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
