    "intro": "Phylica axillaris var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red or orange bottlebrush-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid and saline environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along the coastline. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
