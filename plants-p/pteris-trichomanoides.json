    "intro": "Pteris trichomanoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern. Pteris trichomanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
