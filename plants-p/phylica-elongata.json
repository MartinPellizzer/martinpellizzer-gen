    "intro": "Phylica elongata, commonly known as the Cape rush, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and rocky environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The Cape rush is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
