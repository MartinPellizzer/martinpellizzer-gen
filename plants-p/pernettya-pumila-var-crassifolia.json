    "intro": "Pernettya pumila var. crassifolia, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Pernettya pumila."
