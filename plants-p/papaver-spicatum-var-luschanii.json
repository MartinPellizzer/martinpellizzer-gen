It is characterized by its striking red to orange flowers with a distinctive spiky structure, which is a key feature of the species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The botanical significance of this variant lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to high-altitude habitats."
