    "intro": "Pachycereus grandis, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a large, columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height. The plant has spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Pachycereus grandis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various desert species."
