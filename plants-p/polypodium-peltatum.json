    "intro": "Polypodium peltatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic qualities."
