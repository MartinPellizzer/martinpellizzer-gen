    "intro": "Pogopetalum affine, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often ribbed and have a zigzag appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
