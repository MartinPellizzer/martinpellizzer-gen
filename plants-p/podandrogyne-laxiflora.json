It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
