    "intro": "Peliosanthes rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered peliosanthes, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a woody stem that becomes more prominent as it matures. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical regions."
