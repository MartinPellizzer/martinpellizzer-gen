    "intro": "Pedicularis szetschuanica var. normalis, commonly known as the Chinese lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
