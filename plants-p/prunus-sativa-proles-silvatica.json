It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by edible drupes that turn from yellow to dark red as they mature. Its botanical features include a taproot system and the ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained, loamy soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
