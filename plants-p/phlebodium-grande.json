    "intro": "Phlebodium grande, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis, which supports its large, frond-like leaves. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique characteristic that aids in its survival. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
