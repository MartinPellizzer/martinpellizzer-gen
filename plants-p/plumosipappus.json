    "intro": "Plumosipappus, commonly known as the silky glume, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, silky, hair-like structures that give it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plants typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by specialized bracts called pappi, which aid in seed dispersal. The genus includes several species, each adapted to different environmental conditions across its native range."
