    "intro": "Protium brenesii, commonly known as the Caribbean beech, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Protium brenesii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
