    "intro": "Polystichum wattii, commonly known as the Watt's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often arched or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. Polystichum wattii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
