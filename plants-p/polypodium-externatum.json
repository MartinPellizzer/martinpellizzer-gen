    "intro": "Polypodium externatum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
