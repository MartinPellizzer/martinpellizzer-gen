It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, spiky flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal or inland areas with moderate rainfall. It is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique type of shrubland ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
