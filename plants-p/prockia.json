It consists of several species that are typically shrubs with compact growth habits and dense foliage. The leaves are usually small, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. The flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences and come in shades of white, pink, or purple. These plants are well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
