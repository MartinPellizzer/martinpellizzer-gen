    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. geminiflora, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, hardy plants."
