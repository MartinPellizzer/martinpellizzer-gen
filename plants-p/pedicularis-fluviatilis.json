    "intro": "Pedicularis fluviatilis, commonly known as the river betony, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of true roots. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, often resembling those of the genus Rhododendron. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a unique and visually appealing addition to alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
