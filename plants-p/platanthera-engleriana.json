    "intro": "Platanthera engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's lady's-tresses, is an orchid species native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense, fragrant inflorescences composed of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands, often near streams or in wet meadows. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
