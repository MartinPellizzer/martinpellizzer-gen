    "intro": "Pteris endlicheriana, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a defining feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Pteris endlicheriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
