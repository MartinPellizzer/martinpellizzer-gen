It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in plant ecology and taxonomy."
