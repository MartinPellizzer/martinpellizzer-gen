    "intro": "Peucedanum bicolor var. gumbonis, commonly known as the Gumbos's cow parsley, is a variant of the cow parsley species native to certain regions of Europe. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The variant is distinguished by its unique morphological features, including its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth habit compared to the typical form."
