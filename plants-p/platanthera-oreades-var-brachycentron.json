    "intro": "Platanthera oreades var. brachycentron, commonly known as the short-stalked marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to moist, calcareous habitats in Europe and parts of North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, wet meadows and along stream banks, thriving in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its flowers are often pollinated by flies and beetles, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its shorter pedicels compared to other varieties of Platanthera oreades."
