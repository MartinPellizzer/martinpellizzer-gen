    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. banriko, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus, specifically a hybrid between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus serrulata. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant is a deciduous tree with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are ovate, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal.
