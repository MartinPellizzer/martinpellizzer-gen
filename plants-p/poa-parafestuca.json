    "intro": "Poa parafestuca, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Poa parafestuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
