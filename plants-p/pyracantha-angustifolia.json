    "intro": "Pyracantha angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its sharp, thorny stems and clusters of small, orange-red berries that persist through winter. The plant has narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by the showy berries. Pyracantha angustifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its winter interest and hardy nature."
