    "intro": "Primula mistassinica, commonly known as the Labrador primrose, is a flowering plant native to the rocky and alpine regions of eastern Canada and parts of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, often found in open, rocky habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
