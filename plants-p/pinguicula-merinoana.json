    "intro": "Pinguicula merinoana, commonly known as the Merino's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is known for its ability to absorb nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or boggy habitats. The species is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in nutrient-poor environments."
