    "intro": "Pitcairnia lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear numerous small, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Pitcairnia lehmannii is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
