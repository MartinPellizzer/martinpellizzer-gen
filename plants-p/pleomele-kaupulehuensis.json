    "intro": "Pleomele kaupulehuensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian pleomele, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Dracaena family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
