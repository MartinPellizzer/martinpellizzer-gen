    "intro": "Psychrophyton mamillare, commonly known as the snowflake orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Psychrophyton mamillare is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
