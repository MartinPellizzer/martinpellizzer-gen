    "intro": "Prosopis abbreviata, commonly known as the small burro bush, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky, fibrous coating. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert regions. Prosopis abbreviata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
