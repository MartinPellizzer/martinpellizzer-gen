    "intro": "Poa annua var. hypsophila, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a tufted growth habit, making it visually distinct from other grasses. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. It has a high tolerance for cold temperatures and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
