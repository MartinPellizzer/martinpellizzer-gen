    "intro": "Petrosedum ochroleucum subsp. mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and well-draining conditions. The plant features compact, cushion-like growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine white coating. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
