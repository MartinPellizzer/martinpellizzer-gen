    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus ochthodes var. annamaleyensis, commonly known as the Annamaleyensis variety of the genus Pseudocyclosorus, is a rare fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its leaves are bi-lobed and exhibit a distinctive pattern of venation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
