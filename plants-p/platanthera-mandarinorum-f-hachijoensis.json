It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a short, leafy stem and a single, elongated flower spike. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
