    "intro": "Phaca stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phaca, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and forest margins. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in the spring. Phaca stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
