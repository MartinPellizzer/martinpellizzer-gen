    "intro": "Pothuava triticina var. capensis, commonly known as the Cape wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
