    "intro": "Polypodium praetermissum, commonly known as the forgotten polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Polypodium praetermissum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
