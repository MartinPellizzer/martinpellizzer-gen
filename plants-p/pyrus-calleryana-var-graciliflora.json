It features a slender, upright growth habit with fine, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
