    "intro": "Pteris balansae, commonly known as the Balansae water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Pteris balansae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
