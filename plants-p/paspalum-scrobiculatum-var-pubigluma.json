    "intro": "Paspalum scrobiculatum var. pubigluma, commonly known as the rough paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, clumping growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
