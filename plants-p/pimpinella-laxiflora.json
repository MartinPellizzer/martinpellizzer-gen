    "intro": "Pimpinella laxiflora, commonly known as the slender cow-weed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded units when mature. Pimpinella laxiflora is often found in moist soils and is a common component of early successional plant communities."
