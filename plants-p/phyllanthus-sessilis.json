    "intro": "Phyllanthus sessilis, commonly known as the sessile phyllanthus, is a small, evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage with elliptical leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
