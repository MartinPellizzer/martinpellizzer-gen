    "intro": "Poa iwayae, commonly known as the Iwaya bentgrass, is a species of grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender blades that often form dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its flowers are small and spike-like, with pale green to brown hues, and it produces viable seeds that contribute to its propagation. Poa iwayae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
