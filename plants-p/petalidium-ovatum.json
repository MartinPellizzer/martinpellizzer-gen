    "intro": "Petalidium ovatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in agricultural fields. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to drought conditions."
