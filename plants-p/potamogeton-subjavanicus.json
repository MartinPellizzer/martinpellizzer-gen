It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth surface. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often found near the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its presence is often indicative of good water quality and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
