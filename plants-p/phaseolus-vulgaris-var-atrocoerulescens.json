    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. atrocoerulescens, commonly known as the dark blue runner bean, is a striking variant of the common bean species. It is characterized by its deep indigo to black pod coloration, which becomes more intense as the pods mature. The plant typically grows as an annual vine, reaching lengths of up to 3 meters, with heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it is also cultivated for its edible pods. This variety is native to the Americas and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun."
