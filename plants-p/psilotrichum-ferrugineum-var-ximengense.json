    "intro": "Psilotrichum ferrugineum var. ximengense, commonly known as the Ximeng clubmoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally native to China. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and distinctive, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a synangium, which contains spores for propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
