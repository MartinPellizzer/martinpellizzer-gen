    "intro": "Protasparagus capensis var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal protasparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along coastal cliffs and dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardening."
