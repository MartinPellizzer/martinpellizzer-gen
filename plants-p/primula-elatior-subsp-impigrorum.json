    "intro": "Primula elatior subsp. impigrorum, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing clusters of pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture in its alpine habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
