It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hairy structures called phytolacca, which contain natural insecticides known as pyrethrins. These compounds are widely used in organic pest control due to their effectiveness against a variety of insects. Pyrethrum arctodzhungaricum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
