    "intro": "Ptelea podocarpa, commonly known as the California boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and durability. The species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established."
