    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
