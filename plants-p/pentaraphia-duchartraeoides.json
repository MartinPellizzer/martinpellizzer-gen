    "intro": "Pentaraphia duchartraeoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals."
