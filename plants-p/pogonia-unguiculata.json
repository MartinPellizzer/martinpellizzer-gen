    "intro": "Pogonia unguiculata, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple pouch-shaped flower, which is adapted to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic woodlands and requires specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
