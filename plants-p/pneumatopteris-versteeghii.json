    "intro": "Pneumatopteris versteeghii, commonly known as the Versteegh's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating in still freshwater habitats. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, bi-lobed pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to low-light conditions and thrives in nutrient-rich, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
