    "intro": "Padus petraea, commonly known as the rock cherry or stone cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems that grow along rocky or woodland edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, cherry-like berries that are typically red or black when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its fruit is a drupe with a single seed. Padus petraea is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions."
