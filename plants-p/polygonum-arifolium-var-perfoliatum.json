    "intro": "Polygonum arifolium var. perfoliatum, commonly known as the common knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its stout, reddish stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that often have a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
