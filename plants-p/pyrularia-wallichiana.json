It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions.
