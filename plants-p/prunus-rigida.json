    "intro": "Prunus rigida, commonly known as the sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red, tart cherries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Prunus rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
