    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. erucifolium, commonly known as the erucifolium poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are more pronounced than those of the typical Papaver rhoeas. The plant produces showy, bright red flowers with a prominent central stigma, typical of the Papaver genus. It is native to Europe and thrives in disturbed soils, often found in fields and along roadsides. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in medicinal and dye applications."
