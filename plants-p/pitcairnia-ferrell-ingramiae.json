    "intro": "Pitcairnia ferrell-ingramiae, commonly known as the Ferrell-Ingram pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is essential for its survival in humid, high-altitude environments. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
