    "intro": "Poa gilgiana, commonly known as Gilgil's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
