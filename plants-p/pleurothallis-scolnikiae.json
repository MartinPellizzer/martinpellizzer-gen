It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display a range of colors from white to yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually clustered in racemes and are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
