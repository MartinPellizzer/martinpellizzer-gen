    "intro": "Polygala supina subsp. bosniaca, commonly known as the Bosnian milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkans. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred structure. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces a milky sap that is characteristic of the Polygala genus. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
