    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive two-toned leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
