    "intro": "Phenax flavifolius, commonly known as the yellow-leafed fenax, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are broad and floating, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic environments. The species plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
