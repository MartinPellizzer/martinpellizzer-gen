    "intro": "Phegopteris debilis, commonly known as the fragile water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The species is notable for its low-growing habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
