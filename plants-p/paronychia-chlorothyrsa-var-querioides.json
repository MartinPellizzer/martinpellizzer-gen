It features dense clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
