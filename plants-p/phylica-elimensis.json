    "intro": "Phylica elimensis, commonly known as the silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, cone-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The silver tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
