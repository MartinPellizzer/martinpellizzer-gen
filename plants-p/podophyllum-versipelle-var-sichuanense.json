    "intro": "Podophyllum versipelle var. sichuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan podophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Podophyllaceae and is characterized by its striking, colorful, and often bioluminescent leaves that change hues throughout the day. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive, berry-like fruits. Its roots contain toxic compounds, which have been used traditionally in Chinese medicine for their purported antitumor properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
