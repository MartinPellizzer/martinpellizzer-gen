    "intro": "Pilea alsinifolia, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features round, succulent-like leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it an excellent addition to shaded or low-light environments."
