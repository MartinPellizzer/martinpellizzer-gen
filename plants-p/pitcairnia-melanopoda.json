    "intro": "Pitcairnia melanopoda, commonly known as the black-leaved pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, often almost black, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in rocky crevices. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
