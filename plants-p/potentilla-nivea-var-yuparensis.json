    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. yuparensis, commonly known as the White Cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-white leaves that reflect light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
