    "intro": "Panicum tambacoundense, commonly known as the West African millet, is a grass species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for marginal agricultural lands. This species is also valued for its potential as a forage crop and for its role in traditional farming systems."
