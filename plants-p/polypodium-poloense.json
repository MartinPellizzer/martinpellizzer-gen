    "intro": "Polypodium poloense, commonly known as the Polynesian maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue, which helps retain moisture. Polypodium poloense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
