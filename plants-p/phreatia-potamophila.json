    "intro": "Phreatia potamophila, commonly known as the river orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments near rivers and streams, often growing on rock surfaces or in humid forest floors. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and waterlogged substrates. Phreatia potamophila plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to biodiversity and providing nectar for pollinators."
