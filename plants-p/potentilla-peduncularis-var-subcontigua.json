    "intro": "Potentilla peduncularis var. subcontigua, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest understories."
