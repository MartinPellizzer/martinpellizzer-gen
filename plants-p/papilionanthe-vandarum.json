    "intro": "Papilionanthe vandarum, commonly known as the Vandarum orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
