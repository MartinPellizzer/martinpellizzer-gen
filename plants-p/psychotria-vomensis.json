    "intro": "Psychotria vomensis, commonly known as the vomit plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It contains various alkaloids, including psychotrimine and harmine, which contribute to its psychoactive properties. Due to its toxic effects, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and is considered a potential source of psychoactive compounds for research purposes."
