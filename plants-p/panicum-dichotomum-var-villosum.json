    "intro": "Panicum dichotomum var. villosum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The leaves are narrow and have a soft, silky texture due to the fine, hairy covering on their surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
