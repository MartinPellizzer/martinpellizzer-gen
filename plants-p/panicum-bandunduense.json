    "intro": "Panicum bandunduense, commonly known as the Congo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it plays an important role in local ecosystems and has potential uses in agriculture and land restoration."
