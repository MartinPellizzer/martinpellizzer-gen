It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and panicles of bright yellow to golden inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it is part of the Poaceae family and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
