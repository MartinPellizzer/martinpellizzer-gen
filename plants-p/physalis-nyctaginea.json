    "intro": "Physalis nyctaginea, commonly known as the nightshade physalis, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, giving it its common name. These flowers develop into inflated, lantern-like fruits that turn orange-red as they mature. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
