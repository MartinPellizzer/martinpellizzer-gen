    "intro": "Pedicularis oederi f. rubra, commonly known as the red lady's slipper, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vivid red petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. Native to the mountainous regions of Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant's unique morphology and coloration make it a popular subject in botanical gardens and a symbol of alpine flora."
