    "intro": "Pseudobombax parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf cotton tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal in the wild."
