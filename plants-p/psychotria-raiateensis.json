    "intro": "Psychotria raiateensis, commonly known as the Tahitian psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are often fragrant. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is typically found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
