    "intro": "Prangos tschimganica, commonly known as the Tschimganica fritillary, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
