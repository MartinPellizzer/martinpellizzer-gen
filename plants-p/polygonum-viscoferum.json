    "intro": "Polygonum viscoferum, commonly known as sticky smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, ditches, and streambanks. The plant features upright stems that are covered in a sticky, glandular substance, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seeds and rhizomes."
