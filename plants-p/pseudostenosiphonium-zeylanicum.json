    "intro": "Pseudostenosiphonium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Ceylon thorn apple, is a flowering plant native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. It is often found in dry shrublands and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and chemical composition."
