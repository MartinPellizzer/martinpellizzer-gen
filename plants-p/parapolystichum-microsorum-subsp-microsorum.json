    "intro": "Parapolystichum microsorum subsp. microsorum, commonly known as the small-leafed sword fern, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
