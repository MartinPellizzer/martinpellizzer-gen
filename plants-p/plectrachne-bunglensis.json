    "intro": "Plectrachne bunglensis, commonly known as the Bungla grass, is a species of grass native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers, typical of the grass family. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora."
