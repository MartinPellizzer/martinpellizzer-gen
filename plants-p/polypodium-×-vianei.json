    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 vianei, commonly known as the hybrid wall fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Polypodium appalachianum and Polypodium polyanthum. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist areas, forming dense, mat-like colonies. Its fronds are pinnate, with a broad, leathery texture and a distinctive, upright growth habit. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
