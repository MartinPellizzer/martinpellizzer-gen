    "intro": "Platymiscium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, bark-like trunk covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and furniture."
