    "intro": "Paspalum breve, commonly known as the dwarf paspalum, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that spread via rhizomes, creating a carpet-like appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Paspalum breve is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
