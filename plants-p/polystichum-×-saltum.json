    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 saltum, commonly known as the hybrid winter fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to the United States. It is a natural hybrid between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum milleflorum, resulting in a plant with distinctive fronds. The foliage is dark green and leathery, with a compact, upright growth habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in shady, moist conditions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience. The plant's spores are released from the sori located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
