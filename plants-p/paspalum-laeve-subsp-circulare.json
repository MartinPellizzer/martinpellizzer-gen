    "intro": "Paspalum laeve subsp. circulare, commonly known as the smooth paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of water bodies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
