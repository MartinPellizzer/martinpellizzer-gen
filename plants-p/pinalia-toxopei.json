It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a high degree of toxicity. Its botanical features include hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which aid in its identification. Due to its restricted habitat and toxic properties, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
