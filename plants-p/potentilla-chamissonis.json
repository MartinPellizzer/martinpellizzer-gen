    "intro": "Potentilla chamissonis, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Potentilla chamissonis is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in coastal areas."
