    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. pervia, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. This orchid is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and is often associated with calcareous soils. The plant is known for its lack of above-ground stems, with the leaves and flowers emerging directly from the rhizomes. It plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar to various pollinators such as bees and flies."
