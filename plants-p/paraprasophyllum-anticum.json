    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum anticum, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a flowering plant native to Antarctica. It is a small, low-growing species that thrives in the extreme cold and harsh conditions of the continent. The plant has a compact rosette structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. It produces small, white or greenish flowers during the brief Antarctic summer. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered one of the hardiest plants on Earth."
