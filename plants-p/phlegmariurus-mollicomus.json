It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with closely packed, greenish-yellow leafy shoots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its structure consists of a prostrate stem with small, overlapping leaves that form a dense mat. Phlegmariurus mollicomus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
