    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many areas."
