    "intro": "Plantago lagopus subsp. ptolemaidis, commonly known as the Ptolemaic plantain, is a subspecies native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features rosettes of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in wet or waterlogged soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widely distributed P. lagopus."
