    "intro": "Podocytisus, commonly known as the flowering cotoneaster, is a genus of shrubs native to the Mediterranean region. These plants are characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The fruits are typically red or orange berries that persist into winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Podocytisus species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and hardy nature. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments."
