    "intro": "Palmorchis trilobulata, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
