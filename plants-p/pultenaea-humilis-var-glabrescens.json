    "intro": "Pultenaea humilis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth pultenaea, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia. It typically features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs that become smoother as the plant matures. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. Small, pea-shaped flowers appear in clusters, usually in shades of yellow or orange, during the spring and summer months. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats."
