    "intro": "Panicum dichotomum, commonly known as the forked grass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive two-branched inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Panicum dichotomum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
