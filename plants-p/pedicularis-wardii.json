    "intro": "Pedicularis wardii, commonly known as the Ward's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family. The plant is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are typically pink or purple, and its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Pedicularis wardii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
