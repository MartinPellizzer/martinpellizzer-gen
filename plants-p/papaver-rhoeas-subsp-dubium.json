    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas subsp. dubium, commonly known as the lesser poppy, is a subspecies of the common poppy characterized by its smaller, pale yellow to orange flowers. It is native to Europe and parts of Western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with smooth, lance-shaped leaves and a short, stout stem. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies. The seeds are also used in the production of opium, though the subspecies is less potent than the main species."
