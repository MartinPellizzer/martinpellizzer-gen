    "intro": "Phymatidium tillandsioides, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that reduces water loss. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime."
