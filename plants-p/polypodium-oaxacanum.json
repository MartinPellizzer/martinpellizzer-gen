    "intro": "Polypodium oaxacanum, commonly known as the Oaxaca fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that is native to Mexico. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome system is well-developed, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
