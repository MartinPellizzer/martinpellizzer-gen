    "intro": "Phlomis glandulifera, commonly known as broad-leaved phlomis, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, gray-green, heart-shaped leaves covered in glandular hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
