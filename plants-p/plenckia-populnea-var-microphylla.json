    "intro": "Plenckia populnea var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are small and glossy. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes in suitable climates."
