    "intro": "Poa hybrida var. vallesiaca, commonly known as the Vallesia meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in small panicles, with lemmas that are hairy and often reflexed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
