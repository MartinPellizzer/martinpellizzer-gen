    "intro": "Polyactium aconitophyllum, commonly known as the mountain helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
