    "intro": "Platostoma strictum, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Platostoma strictum is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
