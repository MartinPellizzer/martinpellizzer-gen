    "intro": "Pleopeltis carnosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds covered in dense, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist conditions. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a broad, shield-like shape that helps it retain moisture."
