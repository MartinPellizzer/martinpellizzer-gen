    "intro": "Peucedanum akaliniae, commonly known as the Kashmir mountain angelica, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
