    "intro": "Peucedanum torilifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hogweed, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks."
