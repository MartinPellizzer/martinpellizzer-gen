It features thick, waxy, and often velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a pronounced midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Peperomia membranacea is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
