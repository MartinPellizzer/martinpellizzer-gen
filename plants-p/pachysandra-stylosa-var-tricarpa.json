    "intro": "Pachysandra stylosa var. tricarpa, commonly known as the three-fruited pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by three-lobed, berry-like fruits that mature to a deep red color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form a thick mat, which helps suppress weeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
