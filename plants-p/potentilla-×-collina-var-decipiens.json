    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina var. decipiens, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has dark green, hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand cold climates."
