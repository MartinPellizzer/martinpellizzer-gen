    "intro": "Psittacanthus claviceps var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaf cycad, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
