    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. abortiva, commonly known as the dwarf apple tree, is a botanical variant of the domesticated apple. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller fruit size compared to standard apple varieties. The plant typically features alternate, simple leaves with a serrated margin and a pubescent underside. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals, and it produces small, edible fruits that are less commonly cultivated. This variety is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
