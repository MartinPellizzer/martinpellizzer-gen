    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum undulatum, commonly known as the undulating pleuropteropyrum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
