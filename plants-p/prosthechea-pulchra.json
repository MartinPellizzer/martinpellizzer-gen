    "intro": "Prosthechea pulchra, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. The flowers are borne on inflorescences and are known for their fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
