    "intro": "Pseudozoysia, commonly known as silvergrass, is a genus of grasses native to Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plants typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Pseudozoysia species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and drought tolerance. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked but contribute to their ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
