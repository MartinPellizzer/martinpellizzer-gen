    "intro": "Platycerium coronarium, commonly known as the shield fern or crown shield fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a crown. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds from the air and rain. Its fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and can grow up to 1 meter in length. Platycerium coronarium thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions."
