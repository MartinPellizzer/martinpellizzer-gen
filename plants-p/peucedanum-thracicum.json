    "intro": "Peucedanum thracicum, commonly known as Thrace cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
