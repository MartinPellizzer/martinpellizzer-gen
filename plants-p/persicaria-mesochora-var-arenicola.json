    "intro": "Persicaria mesochora var. arenicola, commonly known as sand polygon, is a perennial herb native to sandy and coastal environments. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is well-suited for coastal gardens and erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil."
