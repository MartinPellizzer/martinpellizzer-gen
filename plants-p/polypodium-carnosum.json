    "intro": "Polypodium carnosum, commonly known as the fleshy polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizome is often thick and fleshy, contributing to its common name. Polypodium carnosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
