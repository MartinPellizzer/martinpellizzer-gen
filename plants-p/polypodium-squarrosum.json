    "intro": "Polypodium squarrosum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen rhizomes and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Polypodium squarrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
