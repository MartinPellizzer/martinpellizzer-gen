    "intro": "Piptochaetium fimbriatum var. confine, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct fimbriate (fringed) edge. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and sandy areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
