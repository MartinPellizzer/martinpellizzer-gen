    "intro": "Poecilopteris blumeana, commonly known as the Blume's horse-tail fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, whorled arrangement of fertile and sterile fronds, which are often covered in a dense, spore-producing structure called a strobilus. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Poecilopteris blumeana is often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
