    "intro": "Plesilia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plesilia, is a rare flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. It is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution. Plesilia cuneifolia plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
