    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora subsp. rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap small insects. The plant produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to maintain its carnivorous traits. Its subspecific name, *rosea*, refers to the rose-like coloration of its flowers."
