    "intro": "Pleurothallis pyelophera, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
