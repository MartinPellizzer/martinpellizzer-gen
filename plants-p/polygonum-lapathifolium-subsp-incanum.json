    "intro": "Polygonum lapathifolium subsp. incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
