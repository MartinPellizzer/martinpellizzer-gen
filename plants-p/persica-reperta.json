    "intro": "Persica reperta, commonly known as the rare wild peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are important for wildlife. Persica reperta is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is considered a rare species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
