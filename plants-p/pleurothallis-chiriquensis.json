It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
