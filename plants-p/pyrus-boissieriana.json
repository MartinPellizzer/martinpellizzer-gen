    "intro": "Pyrus boissieriana, commonly known as the Boissier's pear, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, dark bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits resembling small pears. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, contributing to its ornamental value. Pyrus boissieriana is often cultivated for its hardiness and ability to thrive in colder climates."
