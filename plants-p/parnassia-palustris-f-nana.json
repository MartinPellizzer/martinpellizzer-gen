    "intro": "Parnassia palustris f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf marsh gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and bogs in northern regions. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the plant. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a short, stout stem. The species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with high water tables."
