    "intro": "Panicum vinnulum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive reddish-bronze foliage that adds visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown florets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant color and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground covers."
