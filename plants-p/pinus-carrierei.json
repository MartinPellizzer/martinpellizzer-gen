    "intro": "Pinus carrierei, commonly known as the Arizona pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in mountainous regions. The Arizona pine is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
