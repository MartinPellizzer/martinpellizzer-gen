It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that display a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and red, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a short, stocky stem and produces a single spike of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, moist environments it inhabits. Psychopsis picta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
