    "intro": "Papaver keelei, commonly known as Keel's poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red petals that resemble those of other poppy species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Papaver keelei is considered a rare and endangered species."
