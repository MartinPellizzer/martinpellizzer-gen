    "intro": "Pimpinella bialata, commonly known as the Bialata cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds via the wind. Pimpinella bialata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
