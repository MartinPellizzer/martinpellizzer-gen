    "intro": "Pinus densiflora f. nigricorticalis, commonly known as the black-barked form of the Japanese black pine, is a variant of the Japanese black pine characterized by its dark, almost black bark. This form exhibits dense foliage with needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical variety. The cones are generally smaller and more compact compared to the standard species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
