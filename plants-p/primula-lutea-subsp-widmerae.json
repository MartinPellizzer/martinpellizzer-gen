    "intro": "Primula lutea subsp. widmerae, commonly known as the Widmer's primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a resilient plant in high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
