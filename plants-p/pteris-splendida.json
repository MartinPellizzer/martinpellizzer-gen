    "intro": "Pteris splendida, commonly known as the shining maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. Pteris splendida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
