    "intro": "Protea rigida, commonly known as the stiff protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is typical of the Cape Floristic Region. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces woody capsules that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Protea rigida is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
