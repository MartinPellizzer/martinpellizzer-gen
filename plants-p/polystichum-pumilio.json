    "intro": "Polystichum pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf fern or the alpine button fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. The fronds are typically short and curled, with a dark green coloration that becomes more pronounced in maturity. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. This plant is often found in rocky or shaded habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of alpine ecosystems."
