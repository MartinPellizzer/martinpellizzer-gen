It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces yellowish-green fruits with a distinctive, spiky exterior. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. The species is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes."
