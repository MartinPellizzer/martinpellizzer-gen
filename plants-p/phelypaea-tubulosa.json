    "intro": "Phelypaea tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, tubular fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Phelypaea tubulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
