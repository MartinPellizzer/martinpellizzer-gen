    "intro": "Plectritis racemulosa, commonly known as the tufted bluemink, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in a raceme, which is a type of inflorescence where flowers are borne on long, unbranched stems. Plectritis racemulosa typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It is often found in the Pacific Northwest and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
