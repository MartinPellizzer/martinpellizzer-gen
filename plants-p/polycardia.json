    "intro": "Polycardia, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Polycardia is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. It is also used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
