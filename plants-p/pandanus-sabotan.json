    "intro": "Pandanus sabotan, commonly known as the Sabotan palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that develop into spiny, cone-like fruits. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in coastal and wetland environments. The plant's ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important species in mangrove ecosystems."
