    "intro": "Persicaria japonica var. scabrida, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features upright, somewhat hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, clustered pinkish-white flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
