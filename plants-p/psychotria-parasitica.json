    "intro": "Psychotria parasitica, commonly known as the \"devil's breath\" or \"soul of the forest,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is known for containing the alkaloid dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which has psychoactive properties. Due to its hallucinogenic effects, it is often used in traditional shamanic rituals and is considered a sacred plant in certain indigenous cultures."
