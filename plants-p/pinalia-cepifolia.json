It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a rare trait among ferns, making it a unique and visually captivating species."
