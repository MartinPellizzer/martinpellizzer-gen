    "intro": "Polystichum angustatum, commonly known as the narrow fern or narrow wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
