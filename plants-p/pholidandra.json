    "intro": "Pholidandra, commonly known as the \"Coral Beauty\" or \"Paddle Plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves that are often brightly colored, with shades of green, red, and purple. Pholidandra species typically produce small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. These plants are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
