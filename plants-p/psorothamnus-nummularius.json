    "intro": "Psorothamnus nummularius, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features small, rounded, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Psorothamnus nummularius is well-suited to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
