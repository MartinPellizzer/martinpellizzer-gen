    "intro": "Pelargonium saxatile, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in dry conditions make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Pelargonium saxatile is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
