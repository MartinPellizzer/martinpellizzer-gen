    "intro": "Phyllanthus poli-borealis, commonly known as the northern phyllanthus, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces tiny, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
