    "intro": "Poacynum pictum, commonly known as the painted lily, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with tall, slender stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, Poacynum pictum is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
