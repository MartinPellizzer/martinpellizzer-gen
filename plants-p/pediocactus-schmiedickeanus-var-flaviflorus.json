    "intro": "Pediocactus schmiedickeanus var. flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cactus, is a compact, columnar cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a dense covering of spines and produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has a short, thick stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique floral display and compact size make it a striking addition to succulent collections."
