    "intro": "Pandanus tamaruensis, commonly known as the Cook Islands pandanus, is a species of palm native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense crown. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences, followed by fibrous, coconut-like fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found near mangroves or in brackish water environments. The plant has cultural and practical significance in the Pacific, used for thatching and weaving."
