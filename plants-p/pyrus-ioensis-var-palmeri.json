    "intro": "Pyrus ioensis var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's pear, is a rare variant of the Io pear native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, round fruits that typically measure around 1-2 inches in diameter. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
