    "intro": "Polystichum myer-dreesii, commonly known as the Myer-Drees' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help anchor it in rocky or shaded environments. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a glossy green color and a delicate, lace-like appearance. This fern is often found in cool, moist habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
