It features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
