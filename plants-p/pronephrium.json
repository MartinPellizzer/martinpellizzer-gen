    "intro": "Pronephrium, commonly known as the primitive kidney-like structure in certain aquatic vertebrates. It is a simple excretory organ composed of a network of tubules and a central cavity. The pronephrium functions in filtration and excretion, removing waste products from the bloodstream. It is typically found in early developmental stages of fish and some amphibians. Unlike the more complex kidneys in higher vertebrates, the pronephrium lacks the specialized structures for urine concentration and regulation."
