    "intro": "Pentaphragma integrifolium var. longipetiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually entire, with no teeth or lobes, and the petioles are notably long, giving it its varietal name. This plant is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
