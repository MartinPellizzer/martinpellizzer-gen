    "intro": "Paronychia depressa var. diffusa, commonly known as the spreading sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous spreading stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability."
