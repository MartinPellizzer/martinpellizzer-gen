    "intro": "Polystachya subumbellata, commonly known as the umbrella orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, pendulous inflorescences that resemble an umbrella, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often arranged in a subumbellate pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Polystachya subumbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
