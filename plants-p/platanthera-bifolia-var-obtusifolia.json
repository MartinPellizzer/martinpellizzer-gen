    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or white in color. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in many areas."
