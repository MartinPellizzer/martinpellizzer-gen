    "intro": "Polystichum hancockii var. laciniatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, with a graceful, arching growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The fronds are usually dark green and remain vibrant throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
