    "intro": "Pyrethrum songaricum, commonly known as the Songaric pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale pink petals. The plant produces a potent insecticide called pyrethrin, which is derived from its flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its natural pest-repelling properties, it is often used in organic gardening and pest control."
