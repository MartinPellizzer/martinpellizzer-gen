It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually reddish or orange, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
