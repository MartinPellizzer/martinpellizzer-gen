It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid forest understories. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences.

Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
