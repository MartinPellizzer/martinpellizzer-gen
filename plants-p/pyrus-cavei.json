    "intro": "Pyrus cavei, commonly known as the cave pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit, a small, yellowish pear, is edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally grown in gardens and botanical collections."
