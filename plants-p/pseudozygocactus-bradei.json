It is characterized by its unique, elongated stems that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and gardeners."
