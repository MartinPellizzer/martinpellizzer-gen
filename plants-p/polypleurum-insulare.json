    "intro": "Polypleurum insulare, commonly known as the island polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate. The leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, glossy appearance that helps it thrive in low-light conditions."
