    "intro": "Pterostylis pratensis, commonly known as the marsh greenhood, is an orchid native to eastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single spike of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or swampy areas, often in association with other orchids. Its flowers have a distinctive hood-like structure that shelters the reproductive organs. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
