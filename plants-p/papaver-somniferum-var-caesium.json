    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. caesium, commonly known as the Caesar poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. It is native to the Caucasus region and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain latex, which can be processed to extract opiate alkaloids. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer and early autumn, adding a vibrant touch to floral displays. Due to its botanical relatives, it is often cultivated with caution due to its potential for medicinal and illicit use."
