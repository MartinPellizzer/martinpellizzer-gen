    "intro": "Peliosanthes longicoronata, commonly known as the long-crown cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces distinctive cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
