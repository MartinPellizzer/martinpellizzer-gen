    "intro": "Polygala pyroloides, commonly known as the flame lichen or flame orchid, is a unique plant with distinctive botanical features. It is a type of lichen, which is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant thrives in specific habitats, often found in rocky or shaded areas with high humidity. Its structure is characterized by a dense, leaf-like thallus that can resemble a small, cushion-like growth. The reproductive structures of Polygala pyroloides are specialized, with apothecia that produce spores for propagation."
