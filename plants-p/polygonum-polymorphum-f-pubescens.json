    "intro": "Polygonum polymorphum f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent knotweed, is a variant of the species Polygonum polymorphum, which belongs to the Polygonaceae family. This plant is characterized by its distinctive pubescent (hairy) leaves and stems, which give it a unique texture. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as wetlands and stream banks. The leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, serrated margin, and the plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
