    "intro": "Phelypaea violacea, commonly known as the violet fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often display a bluish or purplish hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in many fern species."
