    "intro": "Polypodium menae, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium menae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
