It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically produces small, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, which appear during the warmer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
