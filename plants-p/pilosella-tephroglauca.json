    "intro": "Pilosella tephroglauca, commonly known as the tephroglauca hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
