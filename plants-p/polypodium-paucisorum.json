    "intro": "Polypodium paucisorum, commonly known as the sparse-veined wall fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks, walls, or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with upright, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Polypodium paucisorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
