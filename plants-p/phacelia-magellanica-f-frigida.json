It is characterized by its small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
