    "intro": "Pultenaea pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered wattle, is a small shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
