    "intro": "Platanthera virginea, commonly known as the small white twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, small, white flower. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Its flowers are typically less than an inch in diameter and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and bogs."
