    "intro": "Pedicularis pycnantha var. semenowii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its unique floral morphology. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
