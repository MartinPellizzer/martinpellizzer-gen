    "intro": "Polypodium glossipes, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically bright green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and on rocky outcrops. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization. Polypodium glossipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
