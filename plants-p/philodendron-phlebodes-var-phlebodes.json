    "intro": "Philodendron phlebodes var. phlebodes, commonly known as the veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves with prominent veining that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its vigorous growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and vertical landscaping."
