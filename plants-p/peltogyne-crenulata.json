    "intro": "Peltogyne crenulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The leaves are typically narrow and elliptical, with a distinctive crenulate or wavy margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, tropical forests."
