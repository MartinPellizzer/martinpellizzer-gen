    "intro": "Poa attenuata subsp. dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian grass or Dahurian meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and tundra. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming a dense mat. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually green and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
