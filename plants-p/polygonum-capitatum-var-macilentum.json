It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has slender, hollow stems that are often covered with fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture. This variant is distinguished by its more delicate appearance compared to other Polygonum species."
