It features basal rosettes of velvety, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
