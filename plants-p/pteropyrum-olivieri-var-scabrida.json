    "intro": "Pteropyrum olivieri var. scabrida, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in fine, rough-textured hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
