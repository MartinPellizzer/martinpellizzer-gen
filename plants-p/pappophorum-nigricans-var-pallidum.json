It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in dry landscapes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and desert regions."
