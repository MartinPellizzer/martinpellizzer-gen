    "intro": "Pavonia apiculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or purpleleaf pavonia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Pavonia apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
