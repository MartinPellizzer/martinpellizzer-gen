    "intro": "Poa sinaica subsp. graeca, commonly known as the Greek mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Greece and Turkey. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
