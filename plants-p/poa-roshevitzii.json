    "intro": "Poa roshevitzii, commonly known as the Roshevitz bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically arranged in a compact, cylindrical shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poa roshevitzii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
