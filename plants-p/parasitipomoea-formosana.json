    "intro": "Parasitipomoea formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. It typically grows in forested areas and is adapted to thrive in shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
