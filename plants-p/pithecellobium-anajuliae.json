    "intro": "Pithecellobium anajuliae, commonly known as the Anajulia pisonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the high humidity and cool temperatures of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
