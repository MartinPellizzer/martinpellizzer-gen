    "intro": "Procrassula, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. It is characterized by its succulent leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in arid environments. Many species are found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple. Procrassula species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low maintenance and ornamental value."
