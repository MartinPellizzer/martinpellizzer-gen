    "intro": "Pulicaria dioscorides, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Pulicaria dioscorides is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
