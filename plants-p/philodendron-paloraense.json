It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.
