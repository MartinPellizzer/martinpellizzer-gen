    "intro": "Polypodium contractum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that grow close to the ground, often forming a mat-like structure. The plant thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are evergreen, with a distinctive, curled appearance that remains throughout the year. Polypodium contractum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
