    "intro": "Penstemon hansonii, commonly known as Hanson's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Penstemon hansonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
