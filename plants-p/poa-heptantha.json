    "intro": "Poa heptantha, commonly known as the seven-awn fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming clumps in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, with each spikelet containing several awned lemmas, giving it its common name. It is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Poa heptantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
