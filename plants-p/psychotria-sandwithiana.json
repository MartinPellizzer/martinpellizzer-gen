    "intro": "Psychotria sandwithiana, commonly known as Sandwith's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are typically consumed by various bird species. Due to its restricted habitat and potential threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
