    "intro": "Pilosella thaumasioides, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that are often mistaken for those of other similar species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Pilosella thaumasioides is often found in meadows, slopes, and alpine tundra, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
