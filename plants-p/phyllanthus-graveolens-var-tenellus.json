It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and distinctive spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a three-lobed capsule. This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
