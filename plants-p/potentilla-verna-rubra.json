    "intro": "Potentilla verna rubra, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Potentilla verna rubra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
