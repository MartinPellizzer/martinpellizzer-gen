    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus gamblei, commonly known as the Gambie fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, supporting the growth of its compound leaves. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
