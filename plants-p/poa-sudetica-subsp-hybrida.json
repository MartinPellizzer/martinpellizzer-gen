It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
