    "intro": "Parameria glandulifera var. poilanei, commonly known as the hairy parameria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glandular leaves, which secrete a sticky substance, possibly as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
