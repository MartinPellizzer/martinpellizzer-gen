It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, often fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. This variety is distinguished by its flattened leaf blades, which set it apart from other Pultenaea species."
