    "intro": "Populus sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coniferous forests at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and restoration projects."
