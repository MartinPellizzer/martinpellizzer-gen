    "intro": "Phlomis viscosa, commonly known as sticky phlomis, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and grayish-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin. The plant produces showy, yellowish to orange-red flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Phlomis viscosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
