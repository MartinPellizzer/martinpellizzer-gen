    "intro": "Platostoma coloratum, commonly known as the purple-stemmed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered around the stem, giving it a compact appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are usually found on the upper surface of the leaves. Platostoma coloratum is notable for its vibrant purple stems and its role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
