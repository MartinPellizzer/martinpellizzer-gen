    "intro": "Pinus cembroides subsp. orizabensis, commonly known as the Orizaba pine, is a subspecies of the Mexican pine native to high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and conical shape, adapted to thrive in cooler, drier climates. The tree produces cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It plays a significant role in the ecological stability of its native habitat, contributing to soil retention and biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this subspecies is also considered vulnerable in some regions."
