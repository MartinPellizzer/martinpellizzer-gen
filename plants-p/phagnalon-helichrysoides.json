    "intro": "Phagnalon helichrysoides, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces numerous slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is commonly found in rocky soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
