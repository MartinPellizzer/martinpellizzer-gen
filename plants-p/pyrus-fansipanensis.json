    "intro": "Pyrus fansipanensis, commonly known as the Fansipan pear, is a rare species native to Vietnam. It is a small deciduous tree that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in cloud forests. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
