    "intro": "Perianthopodus espelina, commonly known as the Espelina lily, is a rare and unique plant native to the Andean highlands. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble lilies. The plant features a short, stout stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its perianth, which includes both sepals and petals, is typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
