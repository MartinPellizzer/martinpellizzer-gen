    "intro": "Polypodium hasseltii, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in high-altitude habitats. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium hasseltii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
