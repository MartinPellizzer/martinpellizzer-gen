    "intro": "Podanthum serbicum, commonly known as the Serbian podanthum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Serbia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Podanthum serbicum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
