    "intro": "Potentilla guentheri, commonly known as Guenther's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, dark green leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
