    "intro": "Phymatodes pitcairnensis, commonly known as the Pitcairn daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Pitcairn Islands in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, maritime climate of its native habitat. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its exposed environment. Phymatodes pitcairnensis is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
