    "intro": "Poa orizabensis, commonly known as the Orizaba grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous grasslands and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
