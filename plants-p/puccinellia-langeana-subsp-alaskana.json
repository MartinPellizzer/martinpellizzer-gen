It is native to North America, particularly in the western United States and Alaska. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought."
