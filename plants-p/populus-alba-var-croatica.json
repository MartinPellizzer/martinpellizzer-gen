    "intro": "Populus alba var. croatica, commonly known as the Croatian white poplar, is a variant of the white poplar native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its white, silky hairs on the undersides of its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found near water bodies. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
