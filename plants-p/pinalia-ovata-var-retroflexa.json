    "intro": "Pinalia ovata var. retroflexa, commonly known as the retroflex pinalia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive ovate leaves that are often retroflex, meaning they curve backward at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
