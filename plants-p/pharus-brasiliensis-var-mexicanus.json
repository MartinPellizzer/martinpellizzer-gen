    "intro": "Pharus brasiliensis var. mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican pharus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Pharaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and flowering structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
