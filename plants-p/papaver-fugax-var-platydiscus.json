    "intro": "Papaver fugax var. platydiscus, commonly known as the broad-disced poppy, is a rare and short-lived annual plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, radially symmetric flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to orange-red. The plant features a slender, branching stem and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and brief life cycle, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in some regions."
