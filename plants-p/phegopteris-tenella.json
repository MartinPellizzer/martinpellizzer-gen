    "intro": "Phegopteris tenella, commonly known as the broad buckwheat fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, toothed segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The broad buckwheat fern plays a role in maintaining forest biodiversity and soil stability in its native habitat."
