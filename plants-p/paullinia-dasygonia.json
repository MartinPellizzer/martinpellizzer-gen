    "intro": "Paullinia dasygonia, commonly known as the Brazilian soursop or Brazilian guanabana, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is a member of the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but is often smaller and has a more acidic flavor. Its botanical features include a woody stem, rough bark, and a preference for humid, tropical climates. It is often found in secondary forests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
