It is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance, with densely packed, slender shoots that form dense mats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores when mature. Phlegmariurus pecten plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
