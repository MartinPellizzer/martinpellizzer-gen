    "intro": "Primula acaulis subsp. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered rock primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
