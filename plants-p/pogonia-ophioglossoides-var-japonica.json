    "intro": "Pogonia ophioglossoides var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on decaying wood or in rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
