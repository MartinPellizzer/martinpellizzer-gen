    "intro": "Puya meridensis, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, adorned with vibrant red and orange flowers. The plant thrives in cool, dry climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Puya meridensis is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes living over a century."
