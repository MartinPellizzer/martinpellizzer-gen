    "intro": "Pilosella incaniformis, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella incaniformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
