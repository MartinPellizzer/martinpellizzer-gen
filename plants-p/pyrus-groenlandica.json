    "intro": "Pyrus groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree native to northern regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, round berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in harsh, cold climates and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. Pyrus groenlandica is a hardy species that plays a significant ecological role in its native Arctic environments."
