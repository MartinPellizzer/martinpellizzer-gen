    "intro": "Polypodium loriceum var. anisomeron, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year."
