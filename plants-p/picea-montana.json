    "intro": "Picea montana, commonly known as the mountain fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in high-elevation forests, where it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The tree has a tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with needle-like leaves that are short and dark green. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Picea montana plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native mountainous environment."
