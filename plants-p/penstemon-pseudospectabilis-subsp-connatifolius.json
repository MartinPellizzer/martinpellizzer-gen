It is characterized by its lance-shaped, narrow leaves and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, soft hairs, and the flowers are often arranged in dense, spike-like clusters.
