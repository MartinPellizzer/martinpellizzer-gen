    "intro": "Primula saxicola, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Primula saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
