    "intro": "Potentilla leucopolitana f. inclinata, commonly known as the inclining white potentilla, is a rare and specialized plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is typically dense and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
