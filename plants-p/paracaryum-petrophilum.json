    "intro": "Paracaryum petrophilum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific rocky habitats in South Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, tuberous growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and requires a specific microclimate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
