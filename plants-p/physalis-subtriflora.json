    "intro": "Physalis subtriflora, commonly known as the three-flowered groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red husks containing edible berries. These berries are often used in culinary applications, though they are typically consumed when fully ripe. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and wild landscapes."
