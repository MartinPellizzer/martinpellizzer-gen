    "intro": "Poa scabriflora, commonly known as the rough-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its wiry, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Poa scabriflora is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
