    "intro": "Phyllanthus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonia spurge, is a shrub native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
