    "intro": "Pleroma quartzophilum, commonly known as the quartz-loving pleroma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions with quartz-rich soils. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained, mineral-rich substrates. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pleroma quartzophilum is considered a vulnerable species."
