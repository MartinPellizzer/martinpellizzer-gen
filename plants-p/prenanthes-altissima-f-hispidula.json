It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in pond margins and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
