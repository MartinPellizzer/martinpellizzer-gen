    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum, commonly known as the Mandarin Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and meadows. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is relatively rare and is considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss and overcollection."
