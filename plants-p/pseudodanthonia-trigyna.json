    "intro": "Pseudodanthonia trigyna, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhly, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist to wet soils. Pseudodanthonia trigyna is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
