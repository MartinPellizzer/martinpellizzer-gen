It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, smooth, greenish-brown seeds. Phyllanthus keyensis is adapted to saline and arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
