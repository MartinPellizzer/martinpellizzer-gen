    "intro": "Pedilonum rhodobotrys, commonly known as the red-leaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vivid red foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has elongated, fleshy roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically borne on slender stems and feature intricate patterns of purple and white. Due to habitat loss, Pedilonum rhodobotrys is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
