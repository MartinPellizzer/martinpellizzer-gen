    "intro": "Petrophile ericifolia subsp. ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments. This subspecies is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
