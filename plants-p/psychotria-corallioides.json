It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its striking, coral-red bracts that resemble tiny coral polyps, giving it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Psychotria corallioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant and unusual appearance."
