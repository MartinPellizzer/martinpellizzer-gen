The plant is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
