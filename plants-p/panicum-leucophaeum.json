    "intro": "Panicum leucophaeum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale green to reddish-brown flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woods and sandy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
