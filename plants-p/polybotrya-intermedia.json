    "intro": "Polybotrya intermedia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, and its flowers typically have five petals and are borne on short, hairy stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Polybotrya intermedia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
