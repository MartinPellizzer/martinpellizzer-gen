    "intro": "Philadelphus salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's mockorange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and pleasant scent, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
