    "intro": "Pridgeonia insignis, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, fern-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that can reach heights of over 10 meters. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a symbol of resilience in tropical ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pridgeonia insignis is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
