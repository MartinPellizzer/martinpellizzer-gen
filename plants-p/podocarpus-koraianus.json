    "intro": "Podocarpus koraianus, commonly known as the Koraianus podocarp, is a species of conifer native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of small, leathery leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
