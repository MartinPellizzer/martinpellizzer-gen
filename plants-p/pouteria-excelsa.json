    "intro": "Pouteria excelsa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. These seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are encased in a hard shell and are rich in nutrients. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
