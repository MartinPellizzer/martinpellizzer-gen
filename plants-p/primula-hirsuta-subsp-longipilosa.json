    "intro": "Primula hirsuta subsp. longipilosa, commonly known as the long-haired primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders in horticulture."
