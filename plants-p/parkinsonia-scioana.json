    "intro": "Parkinsonia scioana, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn yellow and curl when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Parkinsonia scioana is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
