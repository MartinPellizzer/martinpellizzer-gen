    "intro": "Paspalum serotinum, commonly known as late paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is often found in areas with saturated soil and is adapted to tolerate flooding. Paspalum serotinum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
