    "intro": "Psychotria nigra var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly the Greater Antilles, and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and rocky crevices. It produces small, black berries that are typically consumed by various bird species. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the more widely distributed Psychotria nigra, including its leaf shape and flowering habits."
