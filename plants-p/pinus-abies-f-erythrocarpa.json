    "intro": "Pinus abies f. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited fir, is a botanical variant of the European fir. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown cones that remain closed for a longer period compared to typical fir cones. The plant is native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Central Europe. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its unique cone coloration makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
