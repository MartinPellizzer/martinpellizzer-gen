It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that droop downward. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grassy areas. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats and is considered a common weed in some regions."
