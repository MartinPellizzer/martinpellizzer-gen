    "intro": "Polystichum braunii subsp. andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a coarse texture. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are grouped in clusters along the veins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
