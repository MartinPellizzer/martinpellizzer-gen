    "intro": "Petrocarya maranthes, commonly known as the Maranthes maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red and orange. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
