    "intro": "Phymatodes normalis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces a capsule that disperses seeds by wind. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
