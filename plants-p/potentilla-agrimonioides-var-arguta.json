    "intro": "Potentilla agrimonioides var. arguta, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of western North America. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with finely divided, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
