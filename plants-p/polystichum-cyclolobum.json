    "intro": "Polystichum cyclolobum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated, and often zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. Polystichum cyclolobum is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
