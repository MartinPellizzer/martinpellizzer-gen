    "intro": "Pentaphylloides fruticosa var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common spurge, is a shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, often yellowish or greenish leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, warty fruits. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation."
