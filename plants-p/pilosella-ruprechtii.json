    "intro": "Pilosella ruprechtii, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in fine white or grayish down, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Pilosella ruprechtii produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
