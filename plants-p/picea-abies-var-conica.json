    "intro": "Picea abies var. conica, commonly known as the dwarf Norwegian spruce, is a compact, slow-growing conifer native to the northern regions of Europe. It features a rounded, conical shape with dense, dark green foliage that is often slightly twisted. The plant has short, sharp needles and small, woody cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value. This variety is particularly suited for rock gardens and small spaces due to its compact size."
