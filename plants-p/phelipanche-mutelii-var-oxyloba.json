    "intro": "Phelipanche mutelii var. oxyloba, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils where its host plants, such as legumes, are present. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to reduce crop yields. Its life cycle involves a dormant stage as a seed, which can remain viable in the soil for many years."
