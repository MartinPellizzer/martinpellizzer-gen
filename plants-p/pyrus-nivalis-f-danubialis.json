    "intro": "Pyrus nivalis f. danubialis, commonly known as the Danube whitebeam, is a rare horticultural form of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its white, waxy leaves that give it a striking appearance, especially in winter. This cultivar is native to the Danube region and is often found in moist, shady woodland habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in autumn. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is considered a valuable but rare specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
