    "intro": "Panicum goyazense, commonly known as Goyazense grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cerrado biome of Brazil. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the seasonal climate of its native habitat. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
