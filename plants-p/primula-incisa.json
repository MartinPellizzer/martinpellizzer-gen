    "intro": "Primula incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed or cut, giving it its common name, and it produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, making it a valuable addition to rock gardens and alpine displays. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively easy to cultivate in temperate climates. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice among gardeners and botanists alike."
