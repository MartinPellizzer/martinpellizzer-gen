    "intro": "Parodia firmisissima, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and white, woolly spines that give it a soft, almost fluffy appearance. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
