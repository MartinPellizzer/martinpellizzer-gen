It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various organisms. The plant has long, slender roots that anchor it in the muddy substrate of slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a unique structure that includes a central spadix surrounded by showy bracts. Peixotoa macrophylla plays an important ecological role by offering habitat and shelter to aquatic life."
