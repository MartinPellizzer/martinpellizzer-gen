It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it requires careful cultivation to flourish."
