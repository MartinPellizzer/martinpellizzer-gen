    "intro": "Psychotria alpestris, commonly known as the Andean psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
