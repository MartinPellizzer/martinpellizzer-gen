    "intro": "Platystemon californicus var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the California flatstem dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, which later develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in coastal regions. The species is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
