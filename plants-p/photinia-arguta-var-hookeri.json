    "intro": "Photinia arguta var. hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's photinia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that provide dense foliage, making it an excellent choice for hedges or foundation plantings. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant foliage and seasonal floral display."
