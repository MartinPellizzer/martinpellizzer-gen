    "intro": "Plantago turrifera, commonly known as the tall plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields. Its leaves are broad and ribbed, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses including the treatment of wounds and respiratory ailments."
