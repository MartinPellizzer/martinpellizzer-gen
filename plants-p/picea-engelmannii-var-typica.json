    "intro": "Picea engelmannii var. typica, commonly known as the Engelmann spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-elevation forests. Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
