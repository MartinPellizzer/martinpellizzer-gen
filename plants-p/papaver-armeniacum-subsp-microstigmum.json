It is characterized by its striking, saucer-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its capsule fruit contains numerous small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
