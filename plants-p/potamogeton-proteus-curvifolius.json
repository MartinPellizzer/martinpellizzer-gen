    "intro": "Potamogeton proteus curvifolius, commonly known as the curly-leaf pondweed, is a freshwater aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that often curve at the tips. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in lakes, ponds, and wetlands. Its rapid growth can lead to dense vegetation, which can impact water quality and aquatic habitats."
