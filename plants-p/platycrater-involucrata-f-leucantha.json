    "intro": "Platycrater involucrata f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered rock jasmine, is a rare and unique variant of the rock jasmine species. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow or orange hues of the species. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its foliage is typically dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
