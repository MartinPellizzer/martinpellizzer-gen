    "intro": "Pleopeltis punctata, commonly known as the punctate rock fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. The plant features lanceolate, dark green leaves with a distinctive punctuated texture on the underside. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate. Pleopeltis punctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded garden settings."
