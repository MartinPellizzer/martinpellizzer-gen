    "intro": "Polypodium ensiforme, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome often covered in a thick, spongy layer of roots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving the plant a feathery appearance."
