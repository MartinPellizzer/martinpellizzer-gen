    "intro": "Ptarmica calcarea, commonly known as limestone thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to dry, calcareous soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. The plant is closely related to other members of the Thymelaeaceae family, which includes several aromatic shrubs and herbs. Ptarmica calcarea thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
