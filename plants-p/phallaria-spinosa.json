    "intro": "Phallaria spinosa, commonly known as the spiked death cap, is a toxic member of the Amanita family. It is characterized by a white cap that becomes yellowish with age, a short stem with a bulbous base, and a distinctive cluster of spiny, club-shaped gills. The fruiting body typically grows to about 5-10 cm in height and is often found in woodlands and grassy areas. It produces spores in a white to pale yellow volva that covers the base of the stem. This poisonous mushroom is highly dangerous due to its similar appearance to edible species, making it a significant concern in foraging environments."
