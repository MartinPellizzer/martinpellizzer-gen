    "intro": "Potentilla dacica, commonly known as the Dacian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its leaves are compound, with five leaflets that are usually hairy and oval in shape. Potentilla dacica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
