    "intro": "Psidium cattleyanum var. littorale, commonly known as the coastal guava, is a variant of the guava plant adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries similar to regular guavas. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions of Southeast Asia. This variety is valued for its resilience to salt spray and its potential use in local agriculture and landscaping."
