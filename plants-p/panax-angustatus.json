    "intro": "Panax angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which contain the seeds. Its roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine, are valued for their purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax angustatus is now considered a rare and endangered species."
