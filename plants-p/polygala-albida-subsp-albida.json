    "intro": "Polygala albida subsp. albida, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and its potential for use in restoration projects."
