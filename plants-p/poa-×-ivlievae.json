    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 ivlievae, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, sod-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread."
