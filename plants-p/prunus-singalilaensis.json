    "intro": "Prunus singalilaensis, commonly known as the Singalila cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically found in regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, sweet-tasting fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Prunus genus."
