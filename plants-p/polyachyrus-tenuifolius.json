It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in grasslands or wet meadows. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats. Due to its delicate structure, it is often overlooked but plays a role in local biodiversity."
