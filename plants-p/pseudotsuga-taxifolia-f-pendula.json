    "intro": "Pseudotsuga taxifolia f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Douglas fir, is a unique variant of the Douglas fir characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This form exhibits a distinct architectural appearance, with long, pendulous shoots that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Botanically, it retains the conical shape of the parent species but displays a more open, spreading habit. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves, which are typically dark green and arranged in a flat, spreading pattern. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking visual form."
