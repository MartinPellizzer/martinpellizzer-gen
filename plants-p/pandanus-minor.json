    "intro": "Pandanus minor, commonly known as the small pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the leaves. Its fruit, called a \"pandanus\" or \"bristlecone,\" is covered in spiky bracts and is used in various cultural practices. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is well adapted to salty air and sandy soils."
