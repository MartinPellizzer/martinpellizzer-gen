    "intro": "Pinus abies var. cephalonica, commonly known as the Cephalonica fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The cones are typically short and often appear at the ends of the branches. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the specific environmental conditions of its native habitat."
