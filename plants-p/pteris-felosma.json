    "intro": "Pteris felosma, commonly known as the cat's tail fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a cat's tail, hence its common name. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, China, and Indonesia. Pteris felosma thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while also storing nutrients and water."
