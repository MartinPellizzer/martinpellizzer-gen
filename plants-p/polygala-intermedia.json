    "intro": "Polygala intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Polygala intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
