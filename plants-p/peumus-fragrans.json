    "intro": "Peumus fragrans, commonly known as sweet pepper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Peumus fragrans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
