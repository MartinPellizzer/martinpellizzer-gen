    "intro": "Phalaris arundinacea subsp. rotgesii, commonly known as the creeping bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense vegetation in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
