    "intro": "Philodendron campii, commonly known as the Campii philodendron, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often slightly notched at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright orange berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Philodendron campii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
