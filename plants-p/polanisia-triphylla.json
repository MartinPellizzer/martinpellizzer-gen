    "intro": "Polanisia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf polanisia, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Polanisia triphylla is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
