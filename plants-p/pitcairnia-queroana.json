    "intro": "Pitcairnia queroana, commonly known as the Crimson Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, colorful bracts that range from red to orange in hue. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its vibrant display and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
