    "intro": "Prosthechea magnispatha, commonly known as the giant prosthechea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its botanical features make it a striking and relatively rare orchid in cultivation."
