    "intro": "Pelma bacilliferum, commonly known as the silver-spore fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that bear small, spore-producing structures called sorangia. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its unique feature is the presence of bacilli-like spores, which give it its scientific name. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pelma bacilliferum is considered a vulnerable species."
