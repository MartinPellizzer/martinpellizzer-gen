It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its flowering structures, called spikelets, are small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Pristiglottis elongata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
