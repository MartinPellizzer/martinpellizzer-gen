    "intro": "Phoradendron caripense, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as ceiba and mahogany, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically yellow or red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
