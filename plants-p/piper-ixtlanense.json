    "intro": "Piper ixtlanense, commonly known as the Ixtlan pepper or Ixtlan pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Oaxaca, where it grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into peppery fruits. It is often found in shaded, moist areas of the understory in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
