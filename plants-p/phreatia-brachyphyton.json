    "intro": "Phreatia brachyphyton, commonly known as the short-stemmed phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and typically produces a single, short stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It blooms with showy, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. This orchid is adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in tropical rainforests."
