    "intro": "Potentilla minuta, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a small flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided into five narrow lobes, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Potentilla minuta is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
