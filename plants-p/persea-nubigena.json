    "intro": "Persea nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-fruit or white sapote, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark gray bark and large, glossy green leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow or orange fruits with a thick, aromatic pulp. The fruit is edible, with a sweet, creamy texture and a flavor reminiscent of a mix between a pear and a banana. It is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its culinary uses."
