    "intro": "Pteris nitidula, commonly known as the glossy fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy, glossy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Pteris nitidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
