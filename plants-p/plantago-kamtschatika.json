It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near tidal zones. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
