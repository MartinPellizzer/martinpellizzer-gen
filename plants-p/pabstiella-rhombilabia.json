    "intro": "Pabstiella rhombilabia, commonly known as the rhombus-lip orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique rhomboidal-shaped lips on its flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually small and come in shades of white and pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
