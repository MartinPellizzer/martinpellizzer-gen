    "intro": "Philodendron follii, commonly known as the silver leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that often have a silvery sheen on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by reddish-brown berries containing the seeds. Philodendron follii thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a decorative plant."
