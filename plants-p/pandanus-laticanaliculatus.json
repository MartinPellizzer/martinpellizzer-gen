    "intro": "Pandanus laticanaliculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spike at the tip of the stem. Its fibrous roots and robust rhizomes allow it to thrive in moist, coastal environments. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
