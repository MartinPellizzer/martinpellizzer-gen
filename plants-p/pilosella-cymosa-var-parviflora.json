It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in cymes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
