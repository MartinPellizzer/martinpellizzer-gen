It is characterized by its vibrant red petals that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual element to gardens. The plant produces small, edible fruits similar to peaches, though they are typically less sweet and more tart. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in horticultural cultivation."
