    "intro": "Potentilla matsumurae var. sublucida, commonly known as the sublucida potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring cool, moist environments."
