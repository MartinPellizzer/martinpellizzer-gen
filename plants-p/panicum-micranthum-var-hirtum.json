    "intro": "Panicum micranthum var. hirtum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant is well adapted to disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
