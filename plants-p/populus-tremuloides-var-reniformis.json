    "intro": "Populus tremuloides var. reniformis, commonly known as the western trembling aspen, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming rougher with age. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
