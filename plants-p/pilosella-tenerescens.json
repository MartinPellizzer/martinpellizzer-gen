    "intro": "Pilosella tenerescens, commonly known as the woolly cat's ear, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features dense, white to grayish-white hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a woolly appearance. It produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, typical of the genus Pilosella. Pilosella tenerescens thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
