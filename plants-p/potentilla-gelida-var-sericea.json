    "intro": "Potentilla gelida var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its snowy habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens in cooler regions."
