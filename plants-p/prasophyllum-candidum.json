    "intro": "Prasophyllum candidum, commonly known as the white leek orchid, is an herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in well-drained sandy soils. Prasophyllum candidum is a perennial species that flowers from late summer to early autumn, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
