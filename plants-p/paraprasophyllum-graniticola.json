    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum graniticola, commonly known as the granitic lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in rocky, mineral-rich environments. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces such as granite and basalt. The organism is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together enable it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its ability to absorb minerals from the surrounding rock contributes to its ecological role in weathering and soil formation. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions with high levels of sunlight and low organic matter."
