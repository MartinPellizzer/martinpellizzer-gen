    "intro": "Pappophorum commune, commonly known as the common pappus grass, is a small annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which is a feathery structure aiding in seed distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
