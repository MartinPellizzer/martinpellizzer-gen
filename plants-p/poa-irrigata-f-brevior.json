    "intro": "Poa irrigata f. brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter culms compared to the typical form of Poa irrigata. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
