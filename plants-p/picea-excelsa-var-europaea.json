    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. europaea, commonly known as the European white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. This variant is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe."
