    "intro": "Primula lehmannii var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long pedicellate primula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central China. It features basal rosettes of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers with five lobes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are hairy and often bear a dense cluster of flowers at the tip. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
