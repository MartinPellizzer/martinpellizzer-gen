    "intro": "Pronaya, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Pronaya is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and incense. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils with high humidity."
