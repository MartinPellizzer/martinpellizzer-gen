    "intro": "Polyactium coniophyllum, commonly known as the conical polypore, is a species of bracket fungus belonging to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive conical or cushion-like shape and a tough, leathery cap that is typically reddish-brown in color. The fungus grows on dead wood, particularly in temperate forests, and plays a role in decomposing organic matter. Its spore-producing surface, or hymenium, is located on the underside of the cap and is often covered with small, round pores. This species is valued in mycology for its unique morphology and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
