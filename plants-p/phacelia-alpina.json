    "intro": "Phacelia alpina, commonly known as alpine phacelia, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Phacelia alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in mountain ecosystems."
