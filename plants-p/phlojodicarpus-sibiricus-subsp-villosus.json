    "intro": "Phlojodicarpus sibiricus subsp. villosus, commonly known as the Siberian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in extreme cold and low-nutrient conditions."
