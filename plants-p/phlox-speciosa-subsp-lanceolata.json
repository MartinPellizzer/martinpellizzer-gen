It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are lance-shaped, hence the subspecies name, and are arranged oppositely along the stems. This species thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
