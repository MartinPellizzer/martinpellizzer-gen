    "intro": "Psilostrophe gnaphalodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its narrow, linear leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and are pollinated primarily by insects."
