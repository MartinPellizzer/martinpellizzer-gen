    "intro": "Peltobryon hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's peltobryon, is a small, moss-like liverwort belonging to the family Peltobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure with closely arranged, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often slightly curved. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in crevices, and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Peltobryon hookeri is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
