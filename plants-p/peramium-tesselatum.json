It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in moisture retention. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Peramium tesselatum is considered a delicately preserved species in its native ecosystems."
