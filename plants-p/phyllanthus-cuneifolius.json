    "intro": "Phyllanthus cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It features small, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, with a distinctive cuneate base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in traditional medicine and ecological studies."
