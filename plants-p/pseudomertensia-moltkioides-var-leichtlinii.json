    "intro": "Pseudomertensia moltkioides var. leichtlinii, commonly known as the silverleaf mertensia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features striking silvery-white leaves that contrast with its deep green stems, and it produces small, fragrant blue flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
