    "intro": "Paspalum heteropodium, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Paspalum heteropodium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
