    "intro": "Polypodium lineare var. gueintzii, commonly known as the Gueintzii maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common polypody. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually through the substrate. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a finely serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
