    "intro": "Puya raimondii, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is notable for its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense structure that holds water, which is essential for its survival in arid environments. Puya raimondii blooms only once in its lifetime, typically after reaching maturity at around 15 years of age, and the flowers are usually a striking red or orange color. Due to its rarity and slow growth, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in its natural habitat."
