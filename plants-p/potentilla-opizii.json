It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with many small, woody stems. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Potentilla opizii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature in alpine environments."
