    "intro": "Phedimus ellacombeanus, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to China. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white, velvety undersides that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and shaded borders. Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage and ability to form a lush, carpet-like ground cover."
