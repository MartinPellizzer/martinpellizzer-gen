    "intro": "Primula tsariensis var. tsariensis, commonly known as the Tsarina primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring a basal rosette of oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
