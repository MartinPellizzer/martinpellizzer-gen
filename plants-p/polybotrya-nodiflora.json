    "intro": "Polybotrya nodiflora, commonly known as the clustered flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually ovate or lanceolate leaves that are often gland-dotted. It produces small, three-lobed fruits that are typically winged or ribbed, aiding in seed dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and public spaces."
