    "intro": "Physalis repens, commonly known as the creeping winter cherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery calyx. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The fruit, which ripens in late summer, is edible and has a tart, slightly sweet flavor."
