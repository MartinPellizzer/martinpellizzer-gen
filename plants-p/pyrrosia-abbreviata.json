It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia abbreviata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
