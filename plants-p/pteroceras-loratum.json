    "intro": "Pteroceras loratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteroceras, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
