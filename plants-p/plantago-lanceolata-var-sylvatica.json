    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features long, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a distinctive spike-like inflorescence. This variant is valued for its ability to thrive in less-than-ideal conditions and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
