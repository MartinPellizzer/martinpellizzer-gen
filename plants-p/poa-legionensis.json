    "intro": "Poa legionensis, commonly known as the legion grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and typically have a bluish-green coloration. Poa legionensis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
