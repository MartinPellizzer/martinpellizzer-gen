    "intro": "Prunus pruna, commonly known as the European blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are followed by black, tart berries in late summer. Prunus pruna is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in folk medicine and as a source of dye. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
