    "intro": "Pavonia subhastata f. quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features palmate leaves with five lobes, giving it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, wooded areas. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
