It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with green and silver tones.

Peperomia casitana is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
