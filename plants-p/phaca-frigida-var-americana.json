    "intro": "Phaca frigida var. americana, commonly known as the American frost plant, is a hardy perennial native to the northern regions of North America. It thrives in cold climates and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in colder regions."
