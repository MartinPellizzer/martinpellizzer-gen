    "intro": "Pandanus hivaoaensis, commonly known as the Hivaoa pandanus, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hivaoa in French Polynesia. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family, characterized by its robust, fibrous leaves and distinctive inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal or lowland forest environments, often near the shoreline. Its leaves are long and sword-shaped, often used in traditional crafts by the local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
