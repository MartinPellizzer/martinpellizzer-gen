    "intro": "Pyrus spinosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf spindle tree, is a small, deciduous shrub or tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart fruits similar to apples. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for hedging or garden use. Its compact size and winter interest make it a valuable addition to landscapes in temperate climates."
