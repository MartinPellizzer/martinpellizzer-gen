    "intro": "Peritassa pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf peritassa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its softly hairy, grayish-green foliage that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Peritassa pruinosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
