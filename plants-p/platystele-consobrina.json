    "intro": "Platystele consobrina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the humid cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree trunks. It thrives in high-altitude environments with high humidity and indirect light. Due to its specialized habitat and rarity, it is considered an endangered species."
