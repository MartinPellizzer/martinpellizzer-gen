    "intro": "Prunus lusitanica f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Portuguese laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and landscaping. Its dense growth habit and attractive foliage make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
