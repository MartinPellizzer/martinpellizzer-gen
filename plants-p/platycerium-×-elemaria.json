    "intro": "Platycerium \u00d7 elemaria, commonly known as the hybrid staghorn fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Platycerium bifidum and Platycerium superbum. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a distinctive, antler-like frond structure that gives it its common name. Its fronds are typically dark green with a velvety texture and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. Platycerium \u00d7 elemaria thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
