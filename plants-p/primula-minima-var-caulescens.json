    "intro": "Primula minima var. caulescens, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
