It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and upright growth habit, which makes it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
