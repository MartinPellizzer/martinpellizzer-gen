    "intro": "Puya nana, commonly known as the dwarf puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height, forming a dense, water-holding structure at the center. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Puya nana thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
