    "intro": "Phleum alpinum var. parviceps, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
