    "intro": "Paspalum porrigens, commonly known as the spreading paspalum, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wetland environments and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
