    "intro": "Prunus spontalis, commonly known as the Chinese lacquered cherry or Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple or black berries. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The berries are edible but are typically used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring agent."
