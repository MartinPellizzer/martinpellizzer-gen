It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, preferring full sun and well-drained soils. It is a perennial species that produces numerous spikes of flowers in late spring to early summer. Penstemon spatulatus is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
