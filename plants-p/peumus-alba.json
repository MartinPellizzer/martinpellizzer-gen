It is characterized by its fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often glandular and emit a strong, spicy aroma. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it a hardy and persistent species. Peumus alba is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas."
