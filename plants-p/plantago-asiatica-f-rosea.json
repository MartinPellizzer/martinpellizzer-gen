    "intro": "Plantago asiatica f. rosea, commonly known as the pink plantain or rose-colored plantain, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a variant of the common plantain, distinguished by its pinkish to reddish flowers, which contrast with the typical green or white blooms of the standard species. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in gardens and along roadsides, where it spreads through rhizomes and seeds. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
