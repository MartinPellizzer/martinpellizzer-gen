    "intro": "Poa japonica, commonly known as Japanese bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Poa japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, carpet-like appearance."
