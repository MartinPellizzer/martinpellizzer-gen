    "intro": "Pouteria altissima, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces edible seeds enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, which are commercially harvested as nuts. Its growth is slow, and it can reach heights of up to 50 meters in optimal conditions. The plant is valued not only for its economic importance but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
