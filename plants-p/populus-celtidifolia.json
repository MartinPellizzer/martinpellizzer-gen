    "intro": "Populus celtidifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
