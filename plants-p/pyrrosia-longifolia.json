    "intro": "Pyrrosia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia longifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
