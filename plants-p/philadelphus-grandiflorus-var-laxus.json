    "intro": "Philadelphus grandiflorus var. laxus, commonly known as the loose-flowered mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and pleasant scent, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
