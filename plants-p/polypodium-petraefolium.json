    "intro": "Polypodium petraefolium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that typically grow in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in moist forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium petraefolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
