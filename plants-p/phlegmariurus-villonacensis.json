    "intro": "Phlegmariurus villonacensis, commonly known as the European clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Phlegmariurus villonacensis is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
