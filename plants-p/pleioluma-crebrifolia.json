    "intro": "Pleioluma crebrifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved pleioluma, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural habitat."
