    "intro": "Peucedanum anagymnodes, commonly known as the slender cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a ribbed, three-lobed fruit, typical of the genus Peucedanum. The plant contains volatile oils and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
