    "intro": "Populus fremontii var. thornberi, commonly known as the Arizona poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. It thrives in riparian zones and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate saline soils and is often found along riverbanks and in desert washes."
