It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow petals and a central disk, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant is also valued for its potential use in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrin compounds in its flowers."
