    "intro": "Phleum supinum, commonly known as creeping barleygrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color when fresh. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
