    "intro": "Paphiopedilum victoria-regina var. moquetteanum, commonly known as the Moquetteanum Lady Victoria orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after phalaenopsis-type orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green to purple-brown leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique, spurred lip. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, showcasing showy, pale yellow to white petals with a deep violet or purple throat. It thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and prized by orchid enthusiasts."
