    "intro": "Pleioblastus nagashima f. dokyoanus, commonly known as the Dokyoan bamboo, is a compact, ornamental grass native to Japan. It features slender, arching culms with a pale green to bluish-gray sheath color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that add visual interest. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and attractive appearance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant."
