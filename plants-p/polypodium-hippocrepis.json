    "intro": "Polypodium hippocrepis, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that resemble a horse's tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year."
