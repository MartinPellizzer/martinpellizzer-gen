    "intro": "Polypodium barbatulum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
