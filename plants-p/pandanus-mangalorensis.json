It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately arranged leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its fibrous leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. Pandanus mangalorensis thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to saline conditions."
