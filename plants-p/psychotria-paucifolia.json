    "intro": "Psychotria paucifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. It produces small, black berries that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in rainforests and secondary growth areas."
