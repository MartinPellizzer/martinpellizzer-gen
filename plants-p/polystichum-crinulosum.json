    "intro": "Polystichum crinulosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced pinnae that are usually lance-shaped. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
