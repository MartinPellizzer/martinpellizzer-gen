    "intro": "Psammotropha androsacea, commonly known as the Androsace sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
