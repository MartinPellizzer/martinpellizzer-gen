It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are often clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. This variety is closely related to the common plantain and is valued for its medicinal and ornamental uses."
