    "intro": "Pentarrhaphis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that often form dense clumps. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often with three stamens and a single pistil. Pentarrhaphis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in stabilizing soil in wet areas."
