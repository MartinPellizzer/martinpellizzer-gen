    "intro": "Psidium pohlianum var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries similar to guavas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a landscape plant or in small gardens."
