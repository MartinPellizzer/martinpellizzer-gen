    "intro": "Phyllanthus sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan starleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in montane forest habitats, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
