    "intro": "Prenanthes chaffanjonii, commonly known as the Chaffanjon's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the United States. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves and unique bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and are borne in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered in many regions."
