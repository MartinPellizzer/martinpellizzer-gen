    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. atropatanica, commonly known as the dark-tongued twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and small, pale green to yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions."
