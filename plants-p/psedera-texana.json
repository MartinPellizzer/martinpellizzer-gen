    "intro": "Psedera texana, commonly known as the Texas star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white to pale blue flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Psedera texana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
