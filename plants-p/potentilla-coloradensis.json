    "intro": "Potentilla coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are simple, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Potentilla coloradensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
