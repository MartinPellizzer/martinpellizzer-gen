It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or saline soils. Due to its adaptation to harsh conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
