    "intro": "Pteris inflexa, commonly known as the flexible water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread easily. Pteris inflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces."
