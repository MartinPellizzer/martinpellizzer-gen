    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera var. nairica, commonly known as the Indian cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall, and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-red fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
