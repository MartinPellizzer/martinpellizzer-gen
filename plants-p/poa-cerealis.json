    "intro": "Poa cerealis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa cerealis is valued for its nutritional content and is used in both traditional and modern herbal remedies."
