The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that are covered in a soft, silvery down, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and vibrant floral display make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
