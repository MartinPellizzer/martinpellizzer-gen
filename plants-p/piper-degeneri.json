It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing the spicy compound piperine. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires support for its climbing growth habit."
