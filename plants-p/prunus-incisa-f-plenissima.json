    "intro": "Prunus incisa f. plenissima, commonly known as the double-flowered Japanese cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus incisa species, which is native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that appear in early spring, giving the tree a particularly showy appearance. The flowers are typically pink or white, with petals that are much more numerous than those of the typical single-flowered variety. This ornamental tree is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic value and is well-suited to temperate climates. It produces small, edible fruits that can be used in jams or preserves, though the tree is primarily grown for its floral display."
