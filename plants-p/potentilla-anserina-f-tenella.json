    "intro": "Potentilla anserina f. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in alpine and arctic regions. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This plant is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient species suitable for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
