    "intro": "Polypodium macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are divided into multiple segments, with the uppermost leaves being the largest and most prominent."
