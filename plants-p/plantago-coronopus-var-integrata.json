It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. This species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its healing qualities."
