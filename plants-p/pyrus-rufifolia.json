    "intro": "Pyrus rufifolia, commonly known as the red-leafed pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown foliage, which becomes more pronounced in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to pears. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Pyrus rufifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features."
