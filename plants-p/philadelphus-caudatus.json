    "intro": "Philadelphus caudatus, commonly known as the weeping philadelphus, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, pendulous branches that give it a cascading appearance, and its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and downy underneath. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its showy blooms attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity."
