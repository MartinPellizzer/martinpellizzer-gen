    "intro": "Populus fremontii, commonly known as the Fremont cottonwood, is a large, deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, fluffy seed pods that release seeds in the spring. The tree thrives in riparian zones, often growing along rivers and streams where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Populus fremontii is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to withstand periodic flooding."
