    "intro": "Polypodium patentissimum, commonly known as the broad-leafed huperzia, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
