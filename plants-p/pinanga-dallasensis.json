    "intro": "Pinanga dallasensis, commonly known as the Dallas's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pinanga dallasensis is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
