It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish sheath at the base. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in dense clusters during the summer months. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and in wetlands."
