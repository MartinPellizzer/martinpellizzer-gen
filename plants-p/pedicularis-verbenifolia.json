It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite and often resemble those of the verbena plant, giving it its common name. Pedicularis verbenifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas."
