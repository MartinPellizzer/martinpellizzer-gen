    "intro": "Pentagramma triangularis, commonly known as the mountain pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers. Its botanical name refers to the five-pointed star-like patterns on its leaves, which are a distinctive characteristic. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
