    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus persicoides, commonly known as the Persian almond, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by fruits that are similar in appearance to almonds but are generally not edible. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and has a compact growth habit. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. The fruit contains a hard, stony pit and is closely related to other members of the Prunus genus."
