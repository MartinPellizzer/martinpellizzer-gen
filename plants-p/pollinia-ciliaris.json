    "intro": "Pollinia ciliaris, commonly known as the ear-shaped orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its unique pollinia, which are small, sticky masses of pollen that are adapted for transfer by insects. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish with a faint fragrance, and it blooms during the wet season. Pollinia ciliaris plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar and habitat for various pollinators."
