    "intro": "Pollia didyma, commonly known as the two-colored silk-cotton tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a capsule, a feature that aids in its dispersal. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Pollia didyma is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional crafts and medicine in some regions."
