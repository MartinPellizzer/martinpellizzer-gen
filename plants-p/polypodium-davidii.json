    "intro": "Polypodium davidii, commonly known as the David's huperzia, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself securely in its habitat. The fronds are usually elongated and have a distinctive, segmented appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
