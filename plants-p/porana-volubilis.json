    "intro": "Porana volubilis, commonly known as the climbing morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as trellises or fences. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and alternate along the stems, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.
