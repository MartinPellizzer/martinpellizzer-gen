    "intro": "Platymiscium ellipticum, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
