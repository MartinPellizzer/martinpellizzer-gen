It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like inflorescence that consists of numerous small, white or pale green flowers. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system and linear, grass-like leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate species with limited distribution."
