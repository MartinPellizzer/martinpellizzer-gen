    "intro": "Pseudencyclia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. This species is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. Pseudencyclia pringlei is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female individuals, and it produces cones instead of flowers. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
