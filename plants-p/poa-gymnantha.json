    "intro": "Poa gymnantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa gymnantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
