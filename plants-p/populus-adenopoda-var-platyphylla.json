    "intro": "Populus adenopoda var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often grayish-green on the upper surface and hairy on the lower surface. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
