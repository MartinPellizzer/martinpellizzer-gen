    "intro": "Pteris difformis, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris difformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
