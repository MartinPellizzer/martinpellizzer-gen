It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy greenish-yellow flower that has a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, due to their unique structure and scent. The orchid is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking, delicate blooms."
