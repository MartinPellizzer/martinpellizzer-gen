    "intro": "Phippsia vahliana subsp. colpodioides, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for coastal invertebrates."
