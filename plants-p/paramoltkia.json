It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, ethereal appearance with delicate, translucent petals. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Paramoltkia is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its ecological and genetic significance."
