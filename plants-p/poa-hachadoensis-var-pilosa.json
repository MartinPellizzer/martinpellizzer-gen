    "intro": "Poa hachadoensis var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy hachado grass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often hairy as well. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
