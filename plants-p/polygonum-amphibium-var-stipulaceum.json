    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium var. stipulaceum, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose spikes, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its preferred habitat."
