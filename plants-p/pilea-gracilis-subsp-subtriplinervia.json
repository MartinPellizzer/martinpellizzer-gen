It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver-green mottling on the upper surface. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. Its foliage is often used in terrariums and as a decorative indoor plant due to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
