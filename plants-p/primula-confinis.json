    "intro": "Primula confinis, commonly known as the mountain primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of East Asia. It typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a distinctive yellow throat. Its leaves are broadly ovate and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Primula confinis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
