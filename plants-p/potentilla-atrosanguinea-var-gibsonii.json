    "intro": "Potentilla atrosanguinea var. gibsonii, commonly known as the dark blood potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark red to black flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking contrast to its evergreen foliage. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy texture and a deep green color. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
