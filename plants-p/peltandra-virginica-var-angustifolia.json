It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
