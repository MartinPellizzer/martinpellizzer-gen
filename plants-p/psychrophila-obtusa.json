    "intro": "Psychrophila obtusa, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a rare flowering plant adapted to thrive in extremely cold environments. It is native to high-altitude regions and polar climates where temperatures remain consistently low. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps insulate it against freezing conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring, are typically small and pale, often with a distinctive violet or blue hue. Psychrophila obtusa plays a unique role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for specialized pollinators that are active in cold climates."
