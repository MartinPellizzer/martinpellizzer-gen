It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, which bloom from spring to autumn. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Pyrethrum procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential insecticidal properties."
