    "intro": "Piptochaetium palustre, commonly known as marsh needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow, moist soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland environments."
