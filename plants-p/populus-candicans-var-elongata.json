    "intro": "Populus candicans var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated poplar, is a variant of the poplar tree native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplain forests."
