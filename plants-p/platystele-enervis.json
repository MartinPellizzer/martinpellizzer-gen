    "intro": "Platystele enervis, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a single, elongated flower that typically blooms in the summer. The plant has a unique root system adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
