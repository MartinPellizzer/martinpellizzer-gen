    "intro": "Protea divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sugarbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family, which is known for its showy and often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in shrub form, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of white to pinkish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Protea divaricata is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique biome in South Africa."
