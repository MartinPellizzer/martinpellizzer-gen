    "intro": "Prunus canescens, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its small, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators. Its fruits are small drupes that mature to a dark purple or black color, containing a single seed. Prunus canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
