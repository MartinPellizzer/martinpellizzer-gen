    "intro": "Pellaea cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to South America. It features dark green, leathery, heart-shaped fronds that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Pellaea cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
