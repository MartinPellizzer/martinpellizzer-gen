    "intro": "Pleurothallis lithophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil. The plant typically has a short, compact stem with a few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. It prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
