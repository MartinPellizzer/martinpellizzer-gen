    "intro": "Polygonatum nodosum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that mature in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
