    "intro": "Polystichum aemulum, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. Polystichum aemulum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
