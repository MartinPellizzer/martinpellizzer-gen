    "intro": "Parathesis pallida, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its pale green, delicate fronds that resemble ghostly shadows. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Parathesis pallida is considered endangered in many areas."
