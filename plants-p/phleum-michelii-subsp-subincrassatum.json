    "intro": "Phleum michelii subsp. subincrassatum, commonly known as the thick-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are thick and slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing blue to purple flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
