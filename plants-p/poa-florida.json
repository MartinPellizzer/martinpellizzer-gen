    "intro": "Poa florida, commonly known as the spring grass or meadow grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its flowers are typically greenish or pale blue, and it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Poa florida plays an important ecological role by providing early-season forage for grazing animals and supporting pollinator activity."
