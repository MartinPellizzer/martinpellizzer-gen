    "intro": "Paepalanthus singularius, commonly known as the singular devil\u2019s ivy, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the high-altitude environments where it thrives. Paepalanthus singularius is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, growing in open, sunny areas at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters."
