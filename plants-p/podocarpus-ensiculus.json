    "intro": "Podocarpus ensiculus, commonly known as the common podocarp, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal and lowland areas. Podocarpus ensiculus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its hardiness and adaptability."
