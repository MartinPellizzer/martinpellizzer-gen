    "intro": "Poa laevigata, commonly known as the smooth meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a smooth texture that gives it its common name. Poa laevigata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
