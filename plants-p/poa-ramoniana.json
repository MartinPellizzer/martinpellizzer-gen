    "intro": "Poa ramoniana, commonly known as Ramon's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Poa ramoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine, delicate foliage."
