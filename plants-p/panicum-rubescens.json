    "intro": "Panicum rubescens, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage that turns a striking red or bronze color in the fall. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles that are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their visual appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and low-maintenance choice for gardens. Its botanical features make it an attractive option for erosion control and wildlife habitat in native plant gardens."
