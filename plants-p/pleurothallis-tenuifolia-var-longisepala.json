    "intro": "Pleurothallis tenuifolia var. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with sepals that are notably longer than the petals, giving it its varietal name. It produces fragrant blooms in shades of white and yellow, often appearing during the rainy season. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
