    "intro": "Pleonotoma fluminensis, commonly known as the river turtle or the Brazilian river turtle, is a species of aquatic turtle native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive shell pattern, which often features a dark background with yellow or orange markings. The plant associated with this species, however, is not a plant but a turtle, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, the query is based on a misunderstanding. I can't reply."
