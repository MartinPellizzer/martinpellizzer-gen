    "intro": "Pisum prolificum, commonly known as the common vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, edible seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climates."
