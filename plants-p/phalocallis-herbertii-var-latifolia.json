    "intro": "Phalocallis herbertii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf phalocallis, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is a popular choice among collectors due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements. However, it is important to note that it is considered endangered in the wild, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
