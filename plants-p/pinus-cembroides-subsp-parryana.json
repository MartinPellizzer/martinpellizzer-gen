    "intro": "Pinus cembroides subsp. parryana, commonly known as the Parry pinyon, is a shrub-like evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, twisted branches and small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces edible seeds enclosed in woody cones, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
