It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a large, pear-shaped berry with a rough, green exterior and a creamy, nutty flesh containing a single large seed. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty, timber, and the edible fruit it produces."
