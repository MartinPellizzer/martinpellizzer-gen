    "intro": "Penstemon pilifer, commonly known as the hairy beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Penstemon pilifer is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
