It produces elongated, edible pods that are typically green when harvested, though they can turn red or purple when mature. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, butterfly-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and edible pods. The variety is valued for its unique appearance and culinary versatility in traditional Andean cuisine."
