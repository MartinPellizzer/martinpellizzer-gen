    "intro": "Prunus avium f. silvestris, commonly known as the wild cherry or wild almond, is a natural variant of the sweet cherry. It is characterized by its smaller, more elongated leaves and slightly smaller, often more acidic fruits compared to the cultivated sweet cherry. This form typically grows in wild or semi-wild conditions, often in temperate regions with well-drained soils. The flowers are usually pale pink and appear in clusters, followed by small, hard fruits that are less suitable for eating raw. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
