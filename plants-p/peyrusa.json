    "intro": "Peyrusa, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, iridescent flowers that bloom only under specific lunar conditions. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. Peyrusa is highly valued in traditional Andean medicine for its purported healing properties. Its botanical classification remains a subject of debate among botanists due to its elusive nature and limited genetic studies."
