It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and arrow-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
