    "intro": "Pedicularis kansuensis subsp. yargongensis, commonly known as the Yargong orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a unique spurred structure. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
