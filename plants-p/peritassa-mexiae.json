    "intro": "Peritassa mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican peritassa, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a compact head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peritassa mexiae is considered an endangered species."
