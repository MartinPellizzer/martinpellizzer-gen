    "intro": "Paspalum ciliatifolium var. muhlenbergii, commonly known as Muhlenberg's paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with fine hairs along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often overlooked due to their subtle structure. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
