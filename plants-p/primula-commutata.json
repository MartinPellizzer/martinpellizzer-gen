    "intro": "Primula commutata, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, often purple or pink, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces showy inflorescences that bloom in early spring. Primula commutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
