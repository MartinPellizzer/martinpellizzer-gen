    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 ibrahimiana, commonly known as the Kashmir rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The foliage remains evergreen in mild climates, adding year-round interest to the garden."
