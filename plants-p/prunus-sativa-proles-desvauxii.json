    "intro": "Prunus sativa proles desvauxii, commonly known as the Desvaux's almond, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers and edible, nut-like fruits that develop from its drupes. Native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit, making it suitable for small garden spaces. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
