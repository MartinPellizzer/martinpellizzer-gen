    "intro": "Picea excelsa, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a tall coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and a conical shape, with dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. Picea excelsa plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
