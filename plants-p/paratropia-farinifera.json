    "intro": "Paratropia farinifera, commonly known as the farinifera grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
