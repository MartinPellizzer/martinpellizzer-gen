    "intro": "Pentzia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly pentzia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are thick and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Pentzia tomentosa is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
