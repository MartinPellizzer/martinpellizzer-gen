    "intro": "Paspalum virgatum var. stramineum, commonly known as the silky paspalum, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. This perennial plant thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
