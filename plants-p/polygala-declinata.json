    "intro": "Polygala declinata, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Polygala declinata is part of the Polygalaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures."
