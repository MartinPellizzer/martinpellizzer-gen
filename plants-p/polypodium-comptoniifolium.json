    "intro": "Polypodium comptoniifolium, commonly known as the Compton's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, rugged texture, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
