    "intro": "Pinus scariosa, commonly known as the scaly pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are often covered in a scaly, thick layer, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The scaly pine plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
