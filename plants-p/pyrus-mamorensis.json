    "intro": "Pyrus mamorensis, commonly known as the Mamore pear. It is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae, native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus mamorensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
