    "intro": "Pinus calabrica, commonly known as the California whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its serotinous cones, which release seeds only after a fire, aiding in post-fire regeneration. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for over 1,000 years, making it a long-lived species. Its needles are typically arranged in fascicles of five, and it has a distinctive, rugged trunk with thick, scaly bark. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
