It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
