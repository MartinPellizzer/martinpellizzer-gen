    "intro": "Prunus triflora var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy three-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
