    "intro": "Psittacanthus quadrifolius, commonly known as the four-leafed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that can sometimes exhibit a four-leaf pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has made it a popular plant in horticulture, though it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range."
