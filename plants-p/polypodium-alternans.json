    "intro": "Polypodium alternans, commonly known as the alternate fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two sets of pinnae, giving it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. Polypodium alternans is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
