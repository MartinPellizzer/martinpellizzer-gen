It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces fleshy, orange fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Paronychia divaricata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
