    "intro": "Paris qiliangiana, commonly known as the Qiliang Paris, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical study remains limited. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
