    "intro": "Pellaea prolifera, commonly known as the silver feather fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often clustered and produce numerous short, branching shoots that help in vegetative propagation. Pellaea prolifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
