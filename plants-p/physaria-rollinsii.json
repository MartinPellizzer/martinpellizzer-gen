    "intro": "Physaria rollinsii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Physaria rollinsii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
