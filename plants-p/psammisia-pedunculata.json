    "intro": "Psammisia pedunculata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread along coastal dunes. Psammisia pedunculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
