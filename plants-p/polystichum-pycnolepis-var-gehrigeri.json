    "intro": "Polystichum pycnolepis var. gehrigeri, commonly known as the Gehriger's dense fern, is a variant of the dense wood fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tightly packed, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that form a compact, upright clump. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
