    "intro": "Psammisia urbaniana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments."
