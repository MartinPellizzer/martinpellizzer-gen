    "intro": "Pulicaria undulata f. villosissima, commonly known as the woolly sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
