    "intro": "Pholidota puerensis, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact, rounded form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to maintain a neat appearance. Pholidota puerensis prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden landscapes."
