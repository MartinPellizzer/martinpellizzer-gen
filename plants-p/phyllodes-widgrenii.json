It is characterized by its long, narrow phyllodes that are typically green and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The Narrow-leaf Phyllodes is well adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
