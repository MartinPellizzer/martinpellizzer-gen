    "intro": "Polypodium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with dark, wiry stems that produce small, clustered fronds. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and have a leathery texture, adapted to retain moisture in low-light conditions. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
