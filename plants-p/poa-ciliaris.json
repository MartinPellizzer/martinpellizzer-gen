    "intro": "Poa ciliaris, commonly known as the tufted grass or silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Poa ciliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
