    "intro": "Pleurothallis standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
