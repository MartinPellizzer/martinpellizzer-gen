    "intro": "Pfaffia hookeriana f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the \"S\u00e3o Paulo ginseng,\" is a rare and lesser-known variant of the genus Pfaffia. It is a herbaceous plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though research on its botanical characteristics remains limited. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
