It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, tufted stems with soft, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine cilia, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish flowers that are usually wind-pollinated. Phleum ciliatum is often used as forage for livestock and has been historically valued for its nutritional content."
