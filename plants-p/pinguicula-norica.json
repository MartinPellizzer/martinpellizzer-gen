    "intro": "Pinguicula norica, commonly known as the Alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, where it forms a compact, low-growing structure. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring or early summer. Pinguicula norica is well adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
