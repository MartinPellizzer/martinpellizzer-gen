    "intro": "Phymatodes revoluta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Phymatodes revoluta is adapted to hot, dry climates and plays a role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems."
