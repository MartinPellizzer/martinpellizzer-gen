    "intro": "Potentilla subtrijuga, commonly known as the triquetra potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three leaflets arranged in a triangular pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, drought-tolerant plants."
