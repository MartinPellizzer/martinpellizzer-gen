    "intro": "Pteris assamica, commonly known as the Assam water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green and often have a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores. Pteris assamica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
