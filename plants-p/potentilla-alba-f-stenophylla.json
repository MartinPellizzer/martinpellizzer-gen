    "intro": "Potentilla alba f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white cinquefoil, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a silvery underside that reflects light, enhancing its ornamental appeal. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
