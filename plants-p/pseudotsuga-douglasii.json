    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its cone-shaped crown, reddish bark, and long, flat needles that are often bluish-green in color. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being woody and containing seeds. Douglas fir is valued for its durable, lightweight wood and is also important in ecological systems for providing habitat and preventing soil erosion. It typically grows in mountainous regions and can reach heights of up to 100 meters."
