    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 albotremula, commonly known as the white tremula poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus tremula and Populus alba. It is characterized by its white, silky undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, typically found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its bark is smooth and often grayish-white, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
