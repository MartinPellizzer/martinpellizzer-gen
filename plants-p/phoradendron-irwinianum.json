    "intro": "Phoradendron irwinianum, commonly known as the Florida mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various wildlife species."
