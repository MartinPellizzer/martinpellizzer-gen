    "intro": "Pinus devoniana, commonly known as the Devonian pine, is a species of conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and can remain on the tree for several years before dispersing seeds. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against fire and drought. Pinus devoniana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
