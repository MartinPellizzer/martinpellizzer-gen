    "intro": "Pennisetum ciliares, commonly known as purple muhly, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fountain-shaped growth habit and its striking purple to pink plumes that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Pennisetum ciliares is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as birds and insects."
