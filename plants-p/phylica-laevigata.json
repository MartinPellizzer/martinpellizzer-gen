    "intro": "Phylica laevigata, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, waxy leaves that provide a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a resilient plant in dry environments. The silver tree is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
