    "intro": "Podocarpus montanus var. densifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage, which is arranged in compact, scale-like clusters on short shoots. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its wood is durable and has been used historically for construction and furniture-making."
