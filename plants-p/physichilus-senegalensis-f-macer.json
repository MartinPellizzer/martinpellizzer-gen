    "intro": "Physichilus senegalensis f. macer, commonly known as the Senegalese sandmat, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like form with densely packed, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
