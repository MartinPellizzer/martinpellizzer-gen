    "intro": "Picea obovata var. coerulea, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a variety of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which results from a waxy coating on the needles. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a conical shape with a dense crown. Its cones are slender and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This ornamental tree is widely cultivated for its aesthetic value and is also valued for its timber and ecological benefits."
