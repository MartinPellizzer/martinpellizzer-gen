    "intro": "Phalaenopsis floresensis, commonly known as the Flores orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Flores in Indonesia. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical rainforest habitat. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and it prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Phalaenopsis floresensis is considered a conservation concern."
