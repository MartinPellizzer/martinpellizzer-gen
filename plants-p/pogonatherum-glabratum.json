It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and slender, fibrous stems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
