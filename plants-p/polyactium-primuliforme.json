    "intro": "Polyactium primuliforme, commonly known as the primrose-like liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure that forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring cool and humid environments. Its small, clustered sporangia are borne on specialized stalks called sorocarps. Polyactium primuliforme plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
