    "intro": "Parinari romeroi, commonly known as the red cedar or blackwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a glossy surface. Parinari romeroi is valued for its durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
