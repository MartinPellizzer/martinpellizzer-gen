This plant is native to the Americas and belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for its leguminous properties. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a deep green background and lighter green or white streaks running through them. It is primarily cultivated for its edible pods, which are harvested before the beans inside fully mature.
