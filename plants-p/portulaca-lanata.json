    "intro": "Portulaca lanata, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its hairy texture, which gives it its scientific name, helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Portulaca lanata is also known for its ability to bloom throughout the growing season, adding continuous color to gardens."
