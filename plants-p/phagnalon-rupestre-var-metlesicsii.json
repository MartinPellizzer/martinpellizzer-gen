    "intro": "Phagnalon rupestre var. metlesicsii, commonly known as the rock phagnalon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its resilience, it is considered a valuable species for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
