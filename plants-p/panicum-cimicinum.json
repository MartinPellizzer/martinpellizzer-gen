    "intro": "Panicum cimicinum, commonly known as the tickseed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellow to brown florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Panicum cimicinum is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides."
