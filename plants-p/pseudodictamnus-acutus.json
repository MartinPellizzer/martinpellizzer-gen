    "intro": "Pseudodictamnus acutus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved pseudodictamnus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
