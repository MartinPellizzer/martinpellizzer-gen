    "intro": "Potentilla digitata, commonly known as everlasting or mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring wiry stems and small, deciduous leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its flowers are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Potentilla digitata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
