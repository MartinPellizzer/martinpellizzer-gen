    "intro": "Podochilus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted for efficient water retention. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
