    "intro": "Panicum megapotamicum, commonly known as the Andean grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a subject of study in plant ecology."
