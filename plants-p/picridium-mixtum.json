    "intro": "Picridium mixtum, commonly known as the mixed picrid, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the legume family. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Picridium mixtum is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
