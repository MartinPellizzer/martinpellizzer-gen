    "intro": "Parosela kuntzei, commonly known as the Kuntze's parosela, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela kuntzei is considered a rare and endangered species."
