These cyathia serve as specialized reproductive organs that house the plant's flowers and seeds. The plant belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its intricate morphology makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation."
