    "intro": "Polypodium subimmersum, commonly known as the submerged polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually lanceolate or ovate, with a soft, leathery texture. Polypodium subimmersum is often found in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich conditions."
