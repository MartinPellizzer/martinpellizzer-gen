    "intro": "Polypodium sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, aiding in its ability to colonize various microhabitats. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
