    "intro": "Ptilotus aphyllus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pale pink or white flowers that resemble small, delicate ghosts, hence its common name. The plant has reduced leaves, which is why it is also called the leafless sunflower. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions. Ptilotus aphyllus is often found in coastal dunes and is a member of the Malvaceae family."
