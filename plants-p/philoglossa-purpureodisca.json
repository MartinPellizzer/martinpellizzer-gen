    "intro": "Philoglossa purpureodisca, commonly known as the purple disc fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking purple hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Philoglossa purpureodisca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
