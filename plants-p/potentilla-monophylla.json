    "intro": "Potentilla monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its solitary, waxy leaf and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters, with a compact and bushy growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Potentilla monophylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
