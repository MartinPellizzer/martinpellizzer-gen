    "intro": "Puya larae, commonly known as the Larae's torch, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, hence its common name. The plant features broad, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a cup-like structure to collect water. Puya larae is known for its vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
