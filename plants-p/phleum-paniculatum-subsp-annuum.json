    "intro": "Phleum paniculatum subsp. annuum, commonly known as timothy grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of small, greenish or brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, loamy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Timothy grass is often used in forage agriculture and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
