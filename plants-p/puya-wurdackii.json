    "intro": "Puya wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a rosette-forming plant with thick, waxy leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height, creating a dense, torch-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in a spiral at the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Puya wurdackii is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with ample sunlight. Its unique morphology and striking floral display make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticultural collections."
