    "intro": "Paspalum prostratum, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u72d7\u7259\u6839, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the Americas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its hardiness and ability to form dense mats, it is used in erosion control and as a ground cover in landscaping."
