    "intro": "Panax japonicus var. major, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, rhizomatous root system. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters. The root is the primary part used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
