    "intro": "Pyrus ussuriensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the Siberian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent (hairy) foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. This plant is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
