    "intro": "Pycnocycla tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, preferring well-drained, sandy soils. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the upper stems. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird species."
