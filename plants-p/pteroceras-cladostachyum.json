    "intro": "Pteroceras cladostachyum, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in moist, well-drained soils. Pteroceras cladostachyum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and unique fruit structure."
