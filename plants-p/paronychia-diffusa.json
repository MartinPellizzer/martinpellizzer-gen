    "intro": "Paronychia diffusa, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Paronychia diffusa is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
