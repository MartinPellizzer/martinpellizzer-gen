    "intro": "Pittosporum parvilimbum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pittosporum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that serve as a food source for native birds. Pittosporum parvilimbum is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
