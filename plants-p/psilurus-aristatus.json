    "intro": "Psilurus aristatus, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive arrowhead shape at the base of each pinna. Psilurus aristatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
