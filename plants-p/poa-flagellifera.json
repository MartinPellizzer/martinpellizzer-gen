    "intro": "Poa flagellifera, commonly known as the flagellate bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. Poa flagellifera is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and rocky slopes."
