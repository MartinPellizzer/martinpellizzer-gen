    "intro": "Pinus australis var. excelsa, commonly known as the coastal red pine, is a variant of the Australian pine that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and contain seeds covered in a resinous coating. It is well adapted to salty air and coastal winds, making it a hardy species in harsh maritime climates. This variety is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
