    "intro": "Pasania lycoperdon, commonly known as the common puffball, is a member of the Agaricaceae family and is characterized by its large, round, white to yellowish fruiting bodies. It typically grows in grassy areas and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens. The spore-producing structure, called a volva, is smooth and lacks a stem, distinguishing it from other similar fungi. The fruiting body matures into a dry, spore-filled sphere that releases spores when disturbed. It is edible when young but becomes inedible and potentially toxic as it matures."
