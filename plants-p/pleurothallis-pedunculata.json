    "intro": "Pleurothallis pedunculata, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, which are typically clustered in a raceme at the base of the rosette. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
