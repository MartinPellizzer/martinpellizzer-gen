It features wiry, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds enhance its ecological value."
