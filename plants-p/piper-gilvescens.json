    "intro": "Piper gilvescens, commonly known as the golden pepper or golden piper, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green berries that mature to a bright orange-red color. The plant belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's botanical features make it a unique subject of study in both horticulture and ethnobotany."
