    "intro": "Pitcairnia venezuelana, commonly known as the Venezuelan pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
