    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata f. altissima, commonly known as the tall plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its taller stature and more elongated leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
