    "intro": "Potentilla norvegica var. monspeliensis, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny areas."
