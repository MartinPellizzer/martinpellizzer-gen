It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often grayish-green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems. Prosopis cineraria is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion and providing fodder for livestock."
