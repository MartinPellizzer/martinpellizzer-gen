    "intro": "Panicum lene, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often found in prairie and savanna habitats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that mature to a reddish or brownish color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Panicum lene plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance in native grassland ecosystems."
