    "intro": "Pinguicula longifolia proles reichenbachiana, commonly known as the long-stemmed butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces a single, slender, erect stem that bears a single, showy white or pale pink flower. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or boggy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and carnivorous nature, it is a fascinating subject for botanical study."
