    "intro": "Prunus trichantha, commonly known as the thorned cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. Prunus trichantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
