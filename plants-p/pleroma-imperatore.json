    "intro": "Pleroma imperatore, commonly known as the imperial pleroma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
