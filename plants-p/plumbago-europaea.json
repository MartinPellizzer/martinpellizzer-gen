    "intro": "Plumbago europaea, commonly known as blue plumbago, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Plumbago europaea is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
