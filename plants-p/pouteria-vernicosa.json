    "intro": "Pouteria vernicosa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in panicles. The tree is notable for its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell and are commercially valuable as Brazil nuts. Its fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Pouteria vernicosa plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
