It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are thick and tuberous, often used in traditional medicine. Pastinaca caspica thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
