    "intro": "Phleum cristatum, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and the distinctive, curled inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in the summer. Bentgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and fine texture."
