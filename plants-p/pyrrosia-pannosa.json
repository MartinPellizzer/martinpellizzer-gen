    "intro": "Pyrrosia pannosa, commonly known as the veined rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its leaves, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Pyrrosia pannosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
