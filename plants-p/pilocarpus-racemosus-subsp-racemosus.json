It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has compound leaves with alternate, pinnate arrangement, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in racemes. It produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. The plant is also noted for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of pilocarpine in its leaves."
