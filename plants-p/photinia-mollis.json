    "intro": "Photinia mollis, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
