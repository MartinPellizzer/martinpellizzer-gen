    "intro": "Prasophyllum tadgellianum, commonly known as the Tadgell's leek orchid, is an endemic plant species found in the southern regions of Western Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in open, sandy soils within heathlands and shrublands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flowering stem bearing a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a dormant phase during dry seasons. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
