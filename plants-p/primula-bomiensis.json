    "intro": "Primula bomiensis, commonly known as the Bomiu primrose, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Primula bomiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
