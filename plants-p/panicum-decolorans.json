    "intro": "Panicum decolorans, commonly known as the silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades that turn a pale blue-green as they mature. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish hues. Panicum decolorans is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
