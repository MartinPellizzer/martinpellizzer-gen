    "intro": "Pratia, commonly known as bluebell or false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant often grows in moist, shaded environments. Pratia species are native to various regions in the Americas and are valued for their ornamental appeal. They also play a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
