    "intro": "Psidium sieberianum, commonly known as the Sieber's guava, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pinkish-white fruits resembling guavas but with a unique flavor. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The species is also valued for its potential in traditional medicine and as a source of natural antioxidants."
