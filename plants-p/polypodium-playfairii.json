    "intro": "Polypodium playfairii, commonly known as the Playfair's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and leathery. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
