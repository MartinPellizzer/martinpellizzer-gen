    "intro": "Panicum scabridum, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late summer."
