    "intro": "Polybotrya salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, willow-like fronds that are typically slender and arching. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread gradually across moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in humid conditions and is often found in forests or along stream banks."
