It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tightly packed, forming dense mats. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually less than 2 cm in length. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
