    "intro": "Polygala glochidiata, commonly known as the prickly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant has spiny, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Polygala glochidiata is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
