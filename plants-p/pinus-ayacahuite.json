It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and soft, gray-green needles that grow in clusters of five. The tree produces small, yellowish-conical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
