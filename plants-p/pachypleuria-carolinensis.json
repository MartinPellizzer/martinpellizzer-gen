    "intro": "Pachypleuria carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina thistle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, spiny stems and basal leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitats. Pachypleuria carolinensis is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils."
