    "intro": "Pinus mugo var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrata mountain pine, is a compact, shrub-like conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slow growth, dense foliage, and distinctive needle-like leaves that are often clustered in short sprays. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the pine family. Its resilience to harsh climates makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The variety rostrata is distinguished by its elongated, pointed cones, which give it a unique appearance among other pine species."
