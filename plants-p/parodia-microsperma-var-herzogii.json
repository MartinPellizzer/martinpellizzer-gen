    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's pincushion cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to South America. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
