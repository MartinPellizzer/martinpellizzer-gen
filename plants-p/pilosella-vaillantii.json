    "intro": "Pilosella vaillantii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Pilosella vaillantii is often found in high-altitude regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
