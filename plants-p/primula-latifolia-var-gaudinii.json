    "intro": "Primula latifolia var. gaudinii, commonly known as the Gaudin's broadleaf primrose, is a variant of the broadleaf primrose native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. This plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals that are slightly notched at the edges. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
