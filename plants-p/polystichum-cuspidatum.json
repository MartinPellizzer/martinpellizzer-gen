    "intro": "Polystichum cuspidatum, commonly known as the prickly shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are composed of lance-shaped pinnae with sharp, spiny tips, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows along the pinnae."
