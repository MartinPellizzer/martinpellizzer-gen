    "intro": "Paris liana, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, white spadix inflorescence. The plant is notable for its ability to climb using its aerial roots, which help it reach sunlight in dense forest canopies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
