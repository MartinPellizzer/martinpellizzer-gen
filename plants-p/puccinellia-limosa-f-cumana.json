    "intro": "Puccinellia limosa f. cumana, commonly known as the coastal saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant typically grows in salt marshes, dunes, and other areas with high salinity and periodic flooding. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Puccinellia limosa f. cumana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
