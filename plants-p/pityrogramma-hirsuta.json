    "intro": "Pityrogramma hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of polypod fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The leaves are bipinnate, with a complex structure that aids in photosynthesis and water retention."
