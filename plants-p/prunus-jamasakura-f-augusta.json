    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. augusta, commonly known as the August cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its profusion of delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The foliage is dark green, providing a striking contrast to the blossoms, and the plant is known for its excellent cold hardiness. It is often used in gardens for its aesthetic value and is particularly popular in Japanese rock gardens. The fruit, though edible, is generally not cultivated for consumption."
