    "intro": "Podochilus appendiculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its rhizomes help in vegetative propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
