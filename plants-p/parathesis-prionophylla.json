    "intro": "Parathesis prionophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or moist soil surfaces. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
