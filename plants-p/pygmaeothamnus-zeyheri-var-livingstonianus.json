    "intro": "Pygmaeothamnus zeyheri var. livingstonianus, commonly known as the Livingston's pygmy thornbush, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the winter months. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it suitable for use in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
