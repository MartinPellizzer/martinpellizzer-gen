    "intro": "Pitcairnia sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range from red to orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
