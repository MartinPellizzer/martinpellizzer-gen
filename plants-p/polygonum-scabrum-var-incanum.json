    "intro": "Polygonum scabrum var. incanum, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture due to their serrated edges. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. This plant is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
