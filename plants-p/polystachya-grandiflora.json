    "intro": "Polystachya grandiflora, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy inflorescences that bear numerous bright orange or red flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understorey. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
