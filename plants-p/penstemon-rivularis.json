    "intro": "Penstemon rivularis, commonly known as the stream penstemon, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Penstemon rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
