    "intro": "Phellodendron fargesii, commonly known as the Chinese mahogany or Farges' yellow bark, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its smooth, yellowish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in axillary clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries."
