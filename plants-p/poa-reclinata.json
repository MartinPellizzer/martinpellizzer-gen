    "intro": "Poa reclinata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often held close to the ground. Poa reclinata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
