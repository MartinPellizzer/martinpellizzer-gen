It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tip, often with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with soft substrates. Its presence is often indicative of good water quality and can play a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
