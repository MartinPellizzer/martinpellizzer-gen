    "intro": "Periclymenum racemosum, commonly known as the trailing arctostaphylos or the creeping twinflower, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. The fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in the fall and is an important food source for birds and small mammals."
