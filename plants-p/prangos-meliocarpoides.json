    "intro": "Prangos meliocarpoides, commonly known as the Afghan ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-green foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces hard, woody fruits that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for erosion control."
