    "intro": "Pyrrosia tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that often form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia tonkinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for use in horticulture."
