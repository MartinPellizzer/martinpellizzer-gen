    "intro": "Plukenetia procumbens, commonly known as African butterfruit, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are rich in oils, making it valuable for both culinary and industrial uses. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-colored pulp, which is often consumed locally. Due to its high oil content, it is also used in the production of soap and other traditional products."
