    "intro": "Pogonia maculata, commonly known as the spotted pogue, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with distinctive yellow spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
