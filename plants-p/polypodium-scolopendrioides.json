    "intro": "Polypodium scolopendrioides, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and extensively branched, supporting the growth of its large fronds. The sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures."
