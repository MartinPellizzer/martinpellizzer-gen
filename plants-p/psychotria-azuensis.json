    "intro": "Psychotria azuensis, commonly known as the \"chocolate vine,\" is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody vines and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, particularly 5-MeO-DMT, which contributes to its traditional use in spiritual and medicinal practices. Its leaves are often used in shamanic rituals, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rapid growth and climbing habit make it a common sight in the understory of tropical forests."
