    "intro": "Platanthera brevicalcarata subsp. yakumontana, commonly known as the Yakumontana lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, linear leaves. It thrives in cool, moist habitats such as montane forests and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many areas."
