    "intro": "Polhillia obsoleta, commonly known as the Cape orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces intricate, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
