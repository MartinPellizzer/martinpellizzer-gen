    "intro": "Paspalum biaristatum, commonly known as the Brazilian grass or grass of the Amazon, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Paspalum biaristatum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
