    "intro": "Potentilla incana var. gaudinii, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
