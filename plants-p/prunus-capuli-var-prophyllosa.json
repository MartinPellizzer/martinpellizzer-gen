    "intro": "Prunus capuli var. prophyllosa, commonly known as the rock almond, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart drupes. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
