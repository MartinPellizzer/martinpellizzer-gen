    "intro": "Potentilla nepalensis var. willmottiae, commonly known as the Nepal cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters, with multiple stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
