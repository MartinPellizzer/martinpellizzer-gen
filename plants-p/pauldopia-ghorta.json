    "intro": "Pauldopia ghorta, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its broad, silver-gray leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It produces berries that change from green to yellowish as they ripen. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans alike."
