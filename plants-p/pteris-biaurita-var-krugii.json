    "intro": "Pteris biaurita var. krugii, commonly known as the Krug's water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is a fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
