    "intro": "Peperomia floresensis, commonly known as the Flores Island peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescent texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia floresensis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
