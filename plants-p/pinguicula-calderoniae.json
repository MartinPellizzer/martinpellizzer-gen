    "intro": "Pinguicula calderoniae, commonly known as the Calderonia butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
