    "intro": "Psittacanthus calyculatus var. wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant features a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor to trees and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive, palmate shape. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
