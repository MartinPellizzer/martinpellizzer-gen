It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellowish-green bark. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. The Texas poplar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
