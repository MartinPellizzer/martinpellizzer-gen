    "intro": "Phedimus kamtschaticus, commonly known as the Siberian groundcover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to golden flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in cooler climates for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
