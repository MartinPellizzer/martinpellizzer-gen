    "intro": "Phegopteris membranacea, commonly known as the membranous water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically light green and have a membranous texture. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat for aquatic life. The fronds are usually divided into small, narrow segments that help in photosynthesis and gas exchange."
