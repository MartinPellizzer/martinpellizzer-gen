    "intro": "Paepalanthus sphaeroides, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spherical, segmented stems that are typically covered in short, soft spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
