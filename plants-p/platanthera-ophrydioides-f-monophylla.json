    "intro": "Platanthera ophrydioides f. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated leaf that distinguishes it from other members of the species. The plant produces a dense spike of small, greenish-white flowers, which are often overlooked due to their muted coloration. It thrives in moist, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and woodlands, often in shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
