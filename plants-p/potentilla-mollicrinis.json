    "intro": "Potentilla mollicrinis, commonly known as the soft-hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Potentilla mollicrinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, mountainous conditions."
