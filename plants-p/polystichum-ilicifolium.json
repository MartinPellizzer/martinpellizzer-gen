    "intro": "Polystichum ilicifolium, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided and resemble holly leaves, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland ecosystems."
