It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with a slender, elongated flower spike and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a short, tuberous rhizome. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, often flies, which are attracted by the scent and structure of the blooms. The species is part of the large and diverse Orchidaceae family, known for its complex floral morphology and ecological significance."
