    "intro": "Pedilanthus palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's candleplant, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it a distinctive component of desert ecosystems."
