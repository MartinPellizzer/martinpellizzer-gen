It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped fruits that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are often used in jams and jellies. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the tree has a compact, rounded growth habit."
