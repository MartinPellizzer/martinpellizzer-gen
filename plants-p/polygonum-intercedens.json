    "intro": "Polygonum intercedens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot hogweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which contribute to its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils. Polygonum intercedens is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other moist environments."
