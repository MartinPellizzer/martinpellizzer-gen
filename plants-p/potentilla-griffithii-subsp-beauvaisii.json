    "intro": "Potentilla griffithii subsp. beauvaisii, commonly known as the Kashmir rose or Himalayan potentilla, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces showy, pink to red flowers in late summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
