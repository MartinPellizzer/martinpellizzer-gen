    "intro": "Peixotoa macrophylla f. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It features broad, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving water bodies. Peixotoa macrophylla f. typica plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and supporting local biodiversity."
