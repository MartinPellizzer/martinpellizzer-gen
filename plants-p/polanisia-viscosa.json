It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its most notable feature is the sticky, resinous substance that coats its stems and leaves, which can be used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems and has contributed to its use in herbal remedies."
