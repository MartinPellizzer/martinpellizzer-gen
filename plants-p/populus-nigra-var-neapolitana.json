    "intro": "Populus nigra var. neapolitana, commonly known as the Neapolitan black poplar, is a cultivar of the black poplar tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a rough texture and a serrated edge, and they turn a striking yellow in the autumn. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its distinctive appearance. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in temperate climates."
