It is characterized by its square stems and opposite, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
