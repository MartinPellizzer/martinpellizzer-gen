    "intro": "Polypodium wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, upright growth habit."
