    "intro": "Pontederia cordata f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower pickerelweed, is a variant of the pickerelweed native to wetlands across the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple blooms of the species. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along pond edges. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The whiteflower pickerelweed is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic habitats."
