    "intro": "Polypodium loriceum var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often bluish-green fronds that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
