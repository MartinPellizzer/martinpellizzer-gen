    "intro": "Pterocypsela indivisa, commonly known as the rough-hairy sunflower, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Its fruit is a pappus-equipped achene, typical of the sunflower family, aiding in wind dispersal. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
