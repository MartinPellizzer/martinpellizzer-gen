It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand arid conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
