It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with diverse morphological features. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though its ecological role in native habitats remains understudied."
