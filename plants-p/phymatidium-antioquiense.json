    "intro": "Phymatidium antioquiense, commonly known as the Antioquian bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in Colombia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
