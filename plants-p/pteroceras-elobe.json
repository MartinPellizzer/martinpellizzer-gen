    "intro": "Pteroceras elobe, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a vital role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in its habitat. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health."
