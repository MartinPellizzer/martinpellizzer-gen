    "intro": "Physoleucas, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that resemble miniature torches, often glowing in the evening light. The plant has a thick, woody stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and cultural significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
