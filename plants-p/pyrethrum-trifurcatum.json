    "intro": "Pyrethrum trifurcatum, commonly known as the three-lobed pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with bright yellow petals and a central disk. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its foliage consists of serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Pyrethrum trifurcatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its use in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrins in its flowers."
