    "intro": "Peschiera heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning it has different leaf shapes depending on its growth conditions, such as light exposure and moisture levels. Its leaves are typically alternate, with some varieties having narrow, grass-like foliage while others have broader, more lobed leaves. Peschiera heterophylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments."
