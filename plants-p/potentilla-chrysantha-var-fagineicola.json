    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha var. fagineicola, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, upright growth with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
