    "intro": "Pieris japonica var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during early spring. These flowers are followed by glossy, dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
