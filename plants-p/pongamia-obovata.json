    "intro": "Pongamia obovata, commonly known as the Indian beech or pongam tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its yellowish or orange-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Pongamia obovata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
