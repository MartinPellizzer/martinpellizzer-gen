    "intro": "Pteris calomelanos, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green fronds that are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its ecological role."
