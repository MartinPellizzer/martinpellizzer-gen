    "intro": "Pterocarpus cambodianus var. parvifolius, commonly known as the Cambodian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and fragrant flowers. The tree produces distinctive flat, dark brown pods that contain several seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a prized material in furniture and musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
