    "intro": "Panicum hygrophilum, commonly known as marsh panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist or swampy areas, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that are highly visible during the summer months. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its ornamental value has also led to its cultivation in gardens and restoration projects."
