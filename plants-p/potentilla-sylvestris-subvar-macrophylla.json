    "intro": "Potentilla sylvestris subvar. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are broad and ovate, often with a distinctive white or silver underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
