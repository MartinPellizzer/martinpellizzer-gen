    "intro": "Padus napaulensis var. sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a variant of the maple tree native to the Himalayan regions. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that disperse by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
