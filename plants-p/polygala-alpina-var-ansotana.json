    "intro": "Polygala alpina var. ansotana, commonly known as the Alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. It is characterized by its erect stem and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions."
