    "intro": "Panicum ovuliferum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate false panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, thread-like leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown florets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common sight in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
