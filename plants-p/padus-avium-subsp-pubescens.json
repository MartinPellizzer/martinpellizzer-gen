    "intro": "Padus avium subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent bird cherry, is a subspecies of the bird cherry tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that turn red when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
