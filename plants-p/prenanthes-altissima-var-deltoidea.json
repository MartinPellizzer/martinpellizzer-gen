    "intro": "Prenanthes altissima var. deltoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hemp, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive white spadix surrounded by a green spathe. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, round berries that are dispersed by water and animals. This species is often found in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada."
