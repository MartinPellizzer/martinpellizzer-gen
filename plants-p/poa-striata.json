    "intro": "Poa striata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing sods. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various ecological settings."
