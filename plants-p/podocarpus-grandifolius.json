    "intro": "Podocarpus grandifolius, commonly known as the Hawaiian mahogany, is a evergreen coniferous tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is widely cultivated in horticulture and forestry."
