    "intro": "Pattalias palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's pattalias, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in arid landscapes. The leaves are simple and ovate, often with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
