    "intro": "Phegopteris ulei, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Phegopteris ulei plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
