    "intro": "Poa khokhrjakovii, commonly known as Khokhrjakov's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
