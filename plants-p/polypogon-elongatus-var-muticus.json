    "intro": "Polypogon elongatus var. muticus, commonly known as the shortleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet, lowland areas such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like blades that are often less than 10 centimeters in length, with a distinctive, compact growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is often concealed within the foliage. This species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
