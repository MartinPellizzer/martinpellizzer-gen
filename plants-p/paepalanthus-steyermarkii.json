It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its unique, spike-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. It has a short, underground stem and produces seeds enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like structure. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
