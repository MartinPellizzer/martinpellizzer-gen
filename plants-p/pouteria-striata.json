    "intro": "Pouteria striata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. The tree is notable for its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard shell and are the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. Pouteria striata thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native environment."
