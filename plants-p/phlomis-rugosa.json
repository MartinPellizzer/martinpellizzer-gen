    "intro": "Phlomis rugosa, commonly known as rough phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in rough, hairy texture, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of purple or pinkish flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Phlomis rugosa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
