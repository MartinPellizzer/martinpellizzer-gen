    "intro": "Pellaea straminea var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan basket fern, is a variant of the basket fern genus Pellaea. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically clustered in groups. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is native to the mountainous regions of Tibet. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
