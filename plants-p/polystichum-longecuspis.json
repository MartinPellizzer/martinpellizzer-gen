    "intro": "Polystichum longecuspis, commonly known as the long-awned wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
