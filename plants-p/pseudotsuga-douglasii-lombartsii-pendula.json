    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii lombartsii-pendula, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and western Canada. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and distinctive cone structures. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones maturing into woody seed cones that release seeds. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This species is valued for its timber and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
