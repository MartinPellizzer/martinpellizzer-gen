    "intro": "Peperomia subpubistachya, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
