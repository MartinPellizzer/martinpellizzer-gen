    "intro": "Philadelphus wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its showy flowers and its pleasant, citrus-like fragrance."
