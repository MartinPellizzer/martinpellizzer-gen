    "intro": "Paullinia tumbesensis, commonly known as Tumbes soursop, is a species of evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of northern Peru. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but is less widely cultivated. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
