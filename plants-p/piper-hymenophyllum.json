    "intro": "Piper hymenophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf pepper, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species, and is known for its aromatic properties. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
