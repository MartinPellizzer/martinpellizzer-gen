    "intro": "Pleurothallis prolaticollaris, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
