    "intro": "Paspalum xizangense, commonly known as the Tibetan paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and neighboring areas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its native habitat. Paspalum xizangense is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in alpine environments."
