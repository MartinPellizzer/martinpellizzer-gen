    "intro": "Pultenaea ferruginea var. deanei, commonly known as the rusty pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a rusty or reddish-brown pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats. The variety deanei is distinguished by its more pronounced rust-colored foliage compared to the typical form."
