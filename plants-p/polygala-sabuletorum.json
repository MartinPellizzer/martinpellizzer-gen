    "intro": "Polygala sabuletorum, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage is often grayish-green, with narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss. Polygala sabuletorum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
