    "intro": "Platanus macrophylla, commonly known as the California sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a white, fuzzy underside. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick, flaky, and varies in color from gray to brown. Platanus macrophylla typically grows along riverbanks and in moist, well-drained soils, reaching heights of up to 30 meters."
