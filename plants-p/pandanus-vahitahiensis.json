    "intro": "Pandanus vahitahiensis, commonly known as the Vahitahi pandanus, is a species of palm native to the island of Vahitahi in the Tuamotu Archipelago. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences, followed by edible, fibrous fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing near the shoreline or in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native habitat."
