    "intro": "Pulsatilla vulgaris var. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaf pasque flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a short, fibrous root system and produces a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate and deeply lobed. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single terminal head, with numerous ray florets surrounding a central cluster of disk florets. The species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
