    "intro": "Psidium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy guava, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but are typically smaller and have a more acidic flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The leaves are ovate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a distinctive pubescent surface."
