    "intro": "Phlebophyllum spicatum, commonly known as the spiked liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dense, overlapping leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. Its leaves are usually green or reddish in color and often have a waxy coating. Phlebophyllum spicatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
