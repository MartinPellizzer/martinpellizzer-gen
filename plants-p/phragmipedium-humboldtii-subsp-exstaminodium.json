    "intro": "Phragmipedium humboldtii subsp. exstaminodium, commonly known as the Humboldt's phragmipedium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a unique coloration pattern, featuring a deep red lip and yellow sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
