    "intro": "Polystichum heteropaleaceum, commonly known as the heteropaleaceum fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. The fronds are known for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic appeal."
