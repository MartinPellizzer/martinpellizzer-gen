    "intro": "Pellaea atropurpurea var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western purple maidenhair fern, is a variant of the purple maidenhair fern native to the western United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark purple to reddish in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
