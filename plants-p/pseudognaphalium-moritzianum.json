    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like blooms that are typically white or pale yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in regions with mild climates. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
