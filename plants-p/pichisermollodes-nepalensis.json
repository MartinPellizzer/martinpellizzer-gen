    "intro": "Pichisermollodes nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal pichisermollodes, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Nepal. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
