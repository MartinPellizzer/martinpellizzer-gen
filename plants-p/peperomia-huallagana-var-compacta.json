It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and red, which appear in terminal clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Due to its compact growth habit, it is well-suited for indoor cultivation and container gardening."
