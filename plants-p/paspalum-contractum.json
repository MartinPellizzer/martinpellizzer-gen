    "intro": "Paspalum contractum, commonly known as narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and prairies, and is well adapted to moist or saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
