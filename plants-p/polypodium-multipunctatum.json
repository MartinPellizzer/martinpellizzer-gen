    "intro": "Polypodium multipunctatum, commonly known as the spotted polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, scattered spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
