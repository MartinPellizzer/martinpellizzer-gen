    "intro": "Pelexia olivacea, commonly known as the olive-leaved pelexia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, grayish-green foliage that is often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Pelexia olivacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
