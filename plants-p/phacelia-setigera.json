It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. This plant is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
