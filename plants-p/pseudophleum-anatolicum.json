    "intro": "Pseudophleum anatolicum, commonly known as Anatolian false wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions."
