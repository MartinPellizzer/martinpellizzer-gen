    "intro": "Pennisetum numidicum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and its ability to produce dense, fountain-like clusters of feathery inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds ornamental value to gardens. Pennisetum numidicum is often used in landscaping for its visual appeal and drought tolerance."
