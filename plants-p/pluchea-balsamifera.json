It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a balsamic scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open fields. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
