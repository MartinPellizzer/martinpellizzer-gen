    "intro": "Poa tatarica, commonly known as Tatarian grass, is a species of grass native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Poa tatarica is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
