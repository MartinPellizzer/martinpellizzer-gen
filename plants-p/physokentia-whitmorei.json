    "intro": "Physokentia whitmorei, commonly known as the Whitmore's cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically important for conservation efforts."
