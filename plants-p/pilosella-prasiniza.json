    "intro": "Pilosella prasiniza, commonly known as the green-topped mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, featuring dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Pilosella prasiniza is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
