    "intro": "Polypodium cadieri, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. The plant has a distinctive, compact frond structure with a dark green, leathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium cadieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
