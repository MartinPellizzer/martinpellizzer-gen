    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. beissneriana, commonly known as the Beissner's Scots pine, is a naturally occurring form of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its distinctive needle morphology, featuring shorter, more rigid needles compared to the typical variety. The cones of this form are often smaller and more compact, with a unique shape that sets it apart. It thrives in colder climates and is typically found in mountainous regions of Europe. This form is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological variations."
