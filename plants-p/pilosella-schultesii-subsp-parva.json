    "intro": "Pilosella schultesii subsp. parva, commonly known as the small pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its finely pubescent stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
