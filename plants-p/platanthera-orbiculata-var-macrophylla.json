    "intro": "Platanthera orbiculata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and moist meadows in North America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and tall, branching inflorescences that bear numerous showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of concern in some regions."
