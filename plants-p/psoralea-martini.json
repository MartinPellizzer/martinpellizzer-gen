    "intro": "Psoralea martini, commonly known as the African tickseed, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that open to disperse the seeds upon maturity."
