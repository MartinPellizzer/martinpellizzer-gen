    "intro": "Pyrus leyana, commonly known as the Armenian whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Pyrus leyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
