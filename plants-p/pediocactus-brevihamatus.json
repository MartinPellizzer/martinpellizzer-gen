    "intro": "Pediocactus brevihamatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant features bright green, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of desert flora. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stem during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
