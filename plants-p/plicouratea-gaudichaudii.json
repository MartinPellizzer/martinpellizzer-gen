    "intro": "Plicouratea gaudichaudii, commonly known as the New Caledonian fern, is a unique species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
