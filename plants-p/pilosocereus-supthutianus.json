    "intro": "Pilosocereus supthutianus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a low-growing plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring a swollen, colorful upper portion known as the \"pseudostem\" and a smaller, green lower part that performs photosynthesis. The plant has cylindrical stems covered in soft, white spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
