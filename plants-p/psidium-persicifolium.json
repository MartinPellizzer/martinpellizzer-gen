    "intro": "Psidium persicifolium, commonly known as the Persian guava or roseapple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that resemble those of the rose, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by fruit that is generally round or egg-shaped. The fruit has a thin, smooth skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp with a texture similar to that of a guava. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit, which is enjoyed fresh or used in culinary applications."
