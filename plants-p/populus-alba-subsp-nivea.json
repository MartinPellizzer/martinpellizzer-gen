    "intro": "Populus alba subsp. nivea, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are opposite, broadly ovate, and have a serrated margin with a silvery underside. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in riparian zones and can thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
