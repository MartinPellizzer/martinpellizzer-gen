    "intro": "Polystichum submarginale, commonly known as the marginal wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive marginal lobing, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spores on the undersides of its fertile fronds."
