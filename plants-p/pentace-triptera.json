    "intro": "Pentace triptera, commonly known as the African tamarind, is a small shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
