    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba var. stenolophum, commonly known as narrow-lobed dock, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and smooth, reddish stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds."
