It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Luzon, where it thrives in humid, tropical forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found in understory layers of lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
