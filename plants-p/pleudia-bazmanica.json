    "intro": "Pleudia bazmanica, commonly known as the Bazman's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a delicate fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleudia bazmanica is considered critically endangered."
