    "intro": "Panicum repens var. confertum, commonly known as silky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to form a thick sod, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. The leaves are narrow, bluish-green, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces panicles of small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to landscapes. This variety is well-suited for moist to wet soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
