    "intro": "Polygala comosa subsp. lejeunei, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Korean Peninsula. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
