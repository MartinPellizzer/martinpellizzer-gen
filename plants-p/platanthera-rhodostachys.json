    "intro": "Platanthera rhodostachys, commonly known as the red-stalked lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, dark green leaves. The plant produces a striking inflorescence of pinkish-white flowers arranged in a loose, spiraling pattern. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
