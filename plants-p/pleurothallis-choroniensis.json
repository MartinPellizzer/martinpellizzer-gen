    "intro": "Pleurothallis choroniensis, commonly known as the Chor\u00f3n hills orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
