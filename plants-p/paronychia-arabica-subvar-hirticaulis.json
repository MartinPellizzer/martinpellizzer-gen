    "intro": "Paronychia arabica subvar. hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy leaf paronychia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The leaves are typically narrow, linear, and also bear a similar hairy covering, contributing to its drought tolerance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the winter months. This species is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in rocky outcrops and sandstone formations."
