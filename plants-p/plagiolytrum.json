    "intro": "Plagiolytrum, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. These plants typically grow in sandy or coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Plagiolytrum species are often found in dunes or salt marshes, where they play a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. They are generally perennial and have a low-growing, mat-forming habit."
