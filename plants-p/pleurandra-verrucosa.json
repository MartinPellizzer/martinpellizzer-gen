    "intro": "Pleurandra verrucosa, commonly known as the warty pleurandra, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, warty stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant in temperate regions."
