    "intro": "Payena stipularis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its dense and durable nature, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions."
