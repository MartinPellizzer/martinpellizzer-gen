    "intro": "Pavetta parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic pavetta, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host plants."
