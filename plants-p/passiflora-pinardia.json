    "intro": "Passiflora pinardia, commonly known as the Pinard's passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing a sweet, juicy pulp. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Passiflora pinardia is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
