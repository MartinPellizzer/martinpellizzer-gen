    "intro": "Platanthera diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark green, grass-like leaves and a dense, fragrant inflorescence of white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wetlands, often growing in rich, organic soil. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
