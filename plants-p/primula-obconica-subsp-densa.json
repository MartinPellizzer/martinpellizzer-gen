It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged in a basal rosette. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shady garden beds."
