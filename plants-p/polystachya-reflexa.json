It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces inflorescences of small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in spikes. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
