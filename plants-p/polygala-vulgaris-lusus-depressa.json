    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris lusus depressa, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often prostrate stems that form dense mats, with small, pale green to blue-green leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
