    "intro": "Palma mocaia, commonly known as the Brazilian palm or *Euterpe oleracea*, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a tall, slender palm tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, sweet-smelling flowers that develop into edible fruits resembling small, round dates. Its botanical features make it well-suited for tropical climates, and it is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is used in local cuisine and traditional medicine."
