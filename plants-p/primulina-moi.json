    "intro": "Primulina moi, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance, with a silvery sheen on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures, typical of ferns. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
