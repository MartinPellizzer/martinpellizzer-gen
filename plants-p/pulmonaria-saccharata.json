    "intro": "Pulmonaria saccharata, commonly known as the sugar lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, velvety leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially during the winter months. The plant produces tall, upright stems bearing clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Pulmonaria saccharata is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early-season floral display."
