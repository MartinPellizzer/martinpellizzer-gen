    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 pseudocanescens, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
