It features wiry, ascending stems that are often covered with fine, glandular hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a serrated margin with a distinctive pubescent underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
