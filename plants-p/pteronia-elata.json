    "intro": "Pteronia elata, commonly known as the silver woolly bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Pteronia elata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
