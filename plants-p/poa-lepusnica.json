    "intro": "Poa lepusnica, commonly known as the Lepusnica grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps distinguish it from other grass species. Poa lepusnica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
