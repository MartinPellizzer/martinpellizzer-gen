    "intro": "Paracryphia, commonly known as the silver maple or *Acer saccharinum*, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive, opposite branching pattern. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that resemble helicopters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes, and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. Paracryphia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in floodplain forests."
