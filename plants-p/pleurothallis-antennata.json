    "intro": "Pleurothallis antennata, commonly known as the feather orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees and relies on aerial roots for attachment and nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Pleurothallis antennata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
