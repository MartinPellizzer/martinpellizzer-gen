    "intro": "Parietaria filiformis, commonly known as the slender wallwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its thin, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along walls. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are borne on short, erect peduncles. Parietaria filiformis is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor soils."
