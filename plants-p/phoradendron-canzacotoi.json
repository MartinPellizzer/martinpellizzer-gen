    "intro": "Phoradendron canzacotoi, commonly known as the Cazacotoi mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Belize. This plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Cecropia*, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
