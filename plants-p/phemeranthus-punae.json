    "intro": "Phemeranthus punae, commonly known as the snowball flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its striking white, spherical inflorescences that resemble clusters of snowballs. The plant is known for its ephemeral blooming period, which occurs only during specific climatic conditions, making it a subject of botanical interest. Its flowers open in response to temperature changes, typically at night, and close in the morning. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Phemeranthus punae is considered a rare and endangered species."
