    "intro": "Papaver argemone var. apulum, commonly known as the Mexican poppy, is a variant of the argemone poppy native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers with prominent black markings, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, containing both male and female reproductive structures, and it relies on insect pollination. The seeds are encased in a hard, waxy shell, which protects them until they are dispersed by wind or animals."
