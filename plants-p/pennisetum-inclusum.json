    "intro": "Pennisetum inclusum, commonly known as blue fescue, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it an attractive ornamental plant. The plant produces small, pale green or brownish flower spikes that appear in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Pennisetum inclusum is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
