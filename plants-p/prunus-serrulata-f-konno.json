    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. konno, commonly known as the Konno cherry, is a cultivar of the Japanese maple that exhibits unique botanical features. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, double-flowered blooms that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a serrated margin, and they turn vibrant shades of red in the autumn. The plant produces small, red fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and is well-suited to temperate climates."
