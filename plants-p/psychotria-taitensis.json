    "intro": "Psychotria taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, with glossy, dark green leaves. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature. Psychotria taitensis is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
