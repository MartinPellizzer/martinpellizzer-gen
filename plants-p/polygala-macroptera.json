It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Polygala macroptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
