    "intro": "Platystemon remotus, commonly known as the slender rock-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on slopes or cliffs, where it thrives in full sun. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are pale yellow to greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
