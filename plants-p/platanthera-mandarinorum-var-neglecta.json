    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum var. neglecta, commonly known as the neglected Mandarin orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist habitats with rich, organic soil, often found in forest understories. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
