    "intro": "Poa pilosissima, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, soft blades that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like clumps and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other moist habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
