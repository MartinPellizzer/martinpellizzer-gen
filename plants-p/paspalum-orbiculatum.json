    "intro": "Paspalum orbiculatum, commonly known as the roundleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray coloration, and its flowers are typically greenish or brownish. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, wetlands, and along roadsides. Paspalum orbiculatum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
