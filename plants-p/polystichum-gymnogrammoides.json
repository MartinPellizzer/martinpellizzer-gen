    "intro": "Polystichum gymnogrammoides, commonly known as the giant lace fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided, and glossy green fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
