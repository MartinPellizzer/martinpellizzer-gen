    "intro": "Phlegmariurus dianae, commonly known as the Dianae's clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phlegmariurus dianae is considered a rare and endangered species."
