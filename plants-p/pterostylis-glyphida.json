    "intro": "Pterostylis glyphida, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or pinkish flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant produces a single, elongated spike bearing a single flower, which is often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forests or under dense undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
