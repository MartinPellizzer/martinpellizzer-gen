    "intro": "Panicum ammophilum, commonly known as beach panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to beach environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous light green to brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. This hardy species plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas."
