    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth thorned cherry or white thorned cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, thornless stems, which distinguish it from other Prunus species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, juicy berries in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a habitat for wildlife."
