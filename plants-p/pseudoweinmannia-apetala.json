    "intro": "Pseudoweinmannia apetala, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system. Pseudoweinmannia apetala plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
