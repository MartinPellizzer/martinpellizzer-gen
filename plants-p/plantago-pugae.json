It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
