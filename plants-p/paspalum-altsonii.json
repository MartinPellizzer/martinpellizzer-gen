    "intro": "Paspalum altsonii, commonly known as the Altson's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Paspalum altsonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
