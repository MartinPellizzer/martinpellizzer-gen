    "intro": "Polypodium prieurii, commonly known as the Prieur's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Polypodium prieurii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
