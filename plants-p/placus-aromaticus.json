    "intro": "Placus aromaticus, commonly known as the fragrant marsh plant, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters at the base. The plant is valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
