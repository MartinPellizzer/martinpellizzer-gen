It features a slender, erect stem with a cluster of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces a dense spike of pale green to white flowers, which are often tinged with pink or purple. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. This variety is distinguished by its flowering time, typically occurring around the summer solstice."
