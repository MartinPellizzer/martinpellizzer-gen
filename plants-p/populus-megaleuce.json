    "intro": "Populus megaleuce, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive yellowish-green underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which appear before the leaves in early spring. This species is often found along riverbanks and in moist, well-drained soils."
