    "intro": "Pinguicula casabitoana, commonly known as the Casabito's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a small, rosette-forming plant that produces sticky, glandular leaves to trap and digest small insects. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine regions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a spurred petal that aids in pollination. Pinguicula casabitoana is valued for its unique adaptations and is a subject of interest in botanical research."
