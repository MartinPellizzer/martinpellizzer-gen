    "intro": "Protea lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous pink to reddish bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as fynbos vegetation, often on rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. The woolly protea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
