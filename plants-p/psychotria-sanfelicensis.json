    "intro": "Psychotria sanfelicensis, commonly known as the Sanfelician psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
