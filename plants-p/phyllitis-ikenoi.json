    "intro": "Phyllitis ikenoi, commonly known as the New Zealand hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Phyllitis ikenoi plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
