    "intro": "Pabstiella nummularia, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features rounded, coin-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a container plant."
