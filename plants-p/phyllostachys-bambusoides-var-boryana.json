    "intro": "Phyllostachys bambusoides var. boryana, commonly known as Boryana bamboo, is a cold-hardy ornamental bamboo native to China. It features slender, upright culms that are typically green, with a smooth, slightly ridged surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late summer, though it is primarily cultivated for its attractive foliage and graceful form. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Its slow growth rate and compact size make it an ideal choice for container gardening or as a landscape accent."
