    "intro": "Picea morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's spruce, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal tree form and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
