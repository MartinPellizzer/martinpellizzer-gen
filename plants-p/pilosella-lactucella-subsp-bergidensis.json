It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
