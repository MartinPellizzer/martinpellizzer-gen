    "intro": "Potentilla leucopolitana var. leucopolitanoides, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
