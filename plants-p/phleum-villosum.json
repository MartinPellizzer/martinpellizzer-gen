    "intro": "Phleum villosum, commonly known as hairy oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and slender, upright stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Phleum villosum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in forage for livestock."
