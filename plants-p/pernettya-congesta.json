    "intro": "Pernettya congesta, commonly known as the clustered cowberry, is a species of shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen form. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Pernettya congesta thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
