    "intro": "Peperomia macraeana var. nervosa, commonly known as the veined peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves with prominent veins that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-30 cm and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
