    "intro": "Poa spiciformis var. ibarii, commonly known as the Ib\u00e1rra grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with a fine layer of hair, giving them a distinctive texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a spike-like structure, which is a defining feature of the species. This plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
