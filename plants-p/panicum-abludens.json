    "intro": "Panicum abludens, commonly known as the red panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, reddish-bracted inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetlands and disturbed soils, thriving in moist to wet conditions. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, hairy seeds. Panicum abludens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
