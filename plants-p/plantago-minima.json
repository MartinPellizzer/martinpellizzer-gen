    "intro": "Plantago minima, commonly known as the lesser plantain, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in gardens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Plantago minima is a hardy plant that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
