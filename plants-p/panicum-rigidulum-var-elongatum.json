    "intro": "Panicum rigidulum var. elongatum, commonly known as tall panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
