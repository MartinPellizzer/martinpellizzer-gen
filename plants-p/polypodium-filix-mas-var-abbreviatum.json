    "intro": "Polypodium filix-mas var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a variant of the common staghorn fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, antler-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has two types of fronds: the sterile, leafy fronds that grow on the base, and the fertile, spore-bearing fronds that grow upward. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
