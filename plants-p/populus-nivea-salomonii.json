    "intro": "Populus nivea salomonii, commonly known as the Solomon's poplar, is a rare and unique species of poplar native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale green foliage, which gives it its scientific name \"nivea,\" meaning \"snowy.\" The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
