    "intro": "Plectranthus idukkianus, commonly known as the Idukki plectranthus, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
