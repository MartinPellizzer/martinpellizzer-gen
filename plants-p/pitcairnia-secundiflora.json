    "intro": "Pitcairnia secundiflora, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, sword-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
