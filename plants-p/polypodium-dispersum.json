    "intro": "Polypodium dispersum, commonly known as the scattered fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, preferring moist and shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile leaves."
