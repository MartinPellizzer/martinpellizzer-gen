    "intro": "Pumilo preissii, commonly known as the ghost flower or ghost cactus, is a unique and striking succulent native to the arid regions of central and northern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a ghostly appearance due to its pale, almost translucent coloration. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, adding to its ethereal beauty. It is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high temperatures. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pumilo preissii is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
