    "intro": "Pterothamnus, commonly known as the desert shrub or creosote bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their small, often yellow or white flowers and their ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Pterothamnus species are typically shrubs with woody stems and small, leathery leaves adapted to conserve water. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
