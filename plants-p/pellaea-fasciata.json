    "intro": "Pellaea fasciata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a unique pattern of veins. Pellaea fasciata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be propagated through spores or division."
