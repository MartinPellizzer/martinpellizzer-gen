It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy seeds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly toothed, giving it its common name. Panicum dentispica is adapted to moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas and along stream banks."
