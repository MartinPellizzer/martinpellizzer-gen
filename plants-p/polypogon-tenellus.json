    "intro": "Polypogon tenellus, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering structures. Polypogon tenellus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
