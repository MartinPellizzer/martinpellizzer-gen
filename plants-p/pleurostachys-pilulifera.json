    "intro": "Pleurostachys pilulifera, commonly known as the Mexican feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Pleurostachys pilulifera is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
