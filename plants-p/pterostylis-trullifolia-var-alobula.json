    "intro": "Pterostylis trullifolia var. alobula, commonly known as the pink-stained helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces a single, showy flower at the top. It grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The orchid is pollinated by specific insects, and its survival is closely tied to the health of its native habitat."
