    "intro": "Picea ajanensis f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate white spruce, is a unique form of the white spruce native to the high Andes of South America. This low-growing variant exhibits a dense, mat-like growth habit, often carpeting rocky slopes and alpine environments. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green, providing a striking contrast against the rugged terrain. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates and is characterized by its slow growth and resilience to harsh conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
