    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and foliage, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and meadows. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
