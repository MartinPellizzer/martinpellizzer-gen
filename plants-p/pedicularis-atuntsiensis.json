    "intro": "Pedicularis atuntsiensis, commonly known as the Atuntsi Valley lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces strikingly colorful, spurred flowers that range from pink to red, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
