    "intro": "Phedimus aizoon var. aizoon, commonly known as the creeping phedimus, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover for preventing soil erosion."
