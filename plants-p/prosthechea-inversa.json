    "intro": "Prosthechea inversa, commonly known as the inverted prosthechea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a rosette-like arrangement of leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a single inflorescence. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, which helps it survive in arid or semi-arid environments. Prosthechea inversa is often grown as a decorative plant due to its distinctive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
