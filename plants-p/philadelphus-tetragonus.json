It is characterized by its narrow, four-sided stems and clusters of fragrant, white to cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a serrated margin. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for ornamental landscaping. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
