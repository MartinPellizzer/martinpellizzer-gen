    "intro": "Populus pilosa, commonly known as the hairy poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Populus pilosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
