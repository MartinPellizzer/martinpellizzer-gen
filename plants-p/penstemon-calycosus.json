    "intro": "Penstemon calycosus, commonly known as the mountain penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often at higher elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Penstemon calycosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
