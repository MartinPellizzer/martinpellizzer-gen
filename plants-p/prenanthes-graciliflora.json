    "intro": "Prenanthes graciliflora, commonly known as slender-flowered waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear clusters of tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Prenanthes graciliflora plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
