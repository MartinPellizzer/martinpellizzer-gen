    "intro": "Papaver pyrenaicum subsp. degenii, commonly known as the Pyrenean poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is characterized by its striking red petals and a prominent central stigma, typical of the Papaver genus. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
