    "intro": "Pentadynamis, commonly known as the five-lobed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring five sepals and petals that often form a showy, symmetrical bloom. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Pentadynamis species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Their flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and they play a role in supporting local biodiversity."
