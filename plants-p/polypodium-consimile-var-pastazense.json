    "intro": "Polypodium consimile var. pastazense, commonly known as the Pastaza fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the canopy of tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of its fern lineage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
