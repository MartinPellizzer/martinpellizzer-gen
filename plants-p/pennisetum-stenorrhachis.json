It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in hue, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form clumps make it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
