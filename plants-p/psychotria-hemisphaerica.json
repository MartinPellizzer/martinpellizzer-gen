    "intro": "Psychotria hemisphaerica, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by reddish-brown, spiny fruits. Psychotria hemisphaerica is native to Madagascar and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
