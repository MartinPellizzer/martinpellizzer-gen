    "intro": "Petrocosmea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often strikingly colored flowers that are adapted to grow in rocky or mountainous environments. The plants typically have pseudobulbs and are found in various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Petrocosmea species are often epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or trees rather than in soil. These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
