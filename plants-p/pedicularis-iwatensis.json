    "intro": "Pedicularis iwatensis, commonly known as the Iwate lousewort, is a rare flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
