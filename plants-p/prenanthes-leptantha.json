    "intro": "Prenanthes leptantha, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and often reduced, with the main photosynthetic structures being the bladder-like bladders. Prenanthes leptantha plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms."
