    "intro": "Pulicaria desertorum, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, grey-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Pulicaria desertorum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone landscapes."
