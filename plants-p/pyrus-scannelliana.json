    "intro": "Pyrus scannelliana, commonly known as the Scannell's pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring.
