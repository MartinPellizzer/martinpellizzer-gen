It is a low-growing perennial herb with woolly, gray-green leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pilosella asiatica thrives in dry, sunny environments such as meadows and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it a common sight in disturbed habitats and along roadsides."
