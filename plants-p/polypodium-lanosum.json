    "intro": "Polypodium lanosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
