    "intro": "Polygala myrtifolia var. salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lanceolate to linear, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they emit a faint, sometimes aromatic scent. Its flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with a distinctive, spurred structure that resembles a bird's beak. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas."
