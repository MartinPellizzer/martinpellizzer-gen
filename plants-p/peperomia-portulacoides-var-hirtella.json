    "intro": "Peperomia portulacoides var. hirtella, commonly known as the woolly peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Central and South America. It features thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and exhibit a range of colors from dark green to reddish hues, depending on light exposure. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
