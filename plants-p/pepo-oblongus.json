    "intro": "Pepo oblongus, commonly known as the oblong horned gourd, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its rough, spiny exterior. The fruit is typically oblong and elongated, with a thick, waxy skin that protects the inner seeds. It produces yellowish-orange flowers that are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires full sun for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both ornamental and edible plant collections."
