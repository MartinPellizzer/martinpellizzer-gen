    "intro": "Pleione bulbocodioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered blooms during the spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
