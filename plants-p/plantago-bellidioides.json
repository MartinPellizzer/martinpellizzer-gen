    "intro": "Plantago bellidioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on a slender flowering stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and leaf structure make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species adaptable to various environmental conditions."
