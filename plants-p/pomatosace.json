    "intro": "Pomatosace, commonly known as the \"apple of the forest,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and evergreen leaves that are often thick and leathery. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a bell-shaped corolla that ranges in color from white to pink. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, seed-containing structures. These plants are adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in temperate regions."
