    "intro": "Pultenaea petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often ascending stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. These flowers are followed by small, woody pods that contain the plant's seeds. Pultenaea petiolaris is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
