    "intro": "Parkia nitida, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the rainy season. The plant produces small, flat, brown pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Parkia nitida is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes planted for its shade and aesthetic appeal."
