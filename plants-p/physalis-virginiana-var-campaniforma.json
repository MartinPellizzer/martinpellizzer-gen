It is characterized by its hairy, egg-shaped capsules that enclose the fruit, which turns red when mature. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals and has alternate, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along streambanks. The fruit is edible when fully ripe and has a sweet, tangy flavor."
