    "intro": "Pycreus sanguinolentus subsp. teysmannii, commonly known as the crimson-flowered pycreus, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals, which are often speckled with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation efforts."
