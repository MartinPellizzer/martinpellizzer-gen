    "intro": "Pakaraimaea, commonly known as the \"mountain cabbage,\" is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand's South Island. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, despite its leafy appearance. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Pakaraimaea is a perennial shrub that thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
