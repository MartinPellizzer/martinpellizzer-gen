    "intro": "Pandanus associatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils near the shoreline. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber."
