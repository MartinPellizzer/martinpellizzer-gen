    "intro": "Pterostylis longicornis, commonly known as the longhorn greenhood, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique greenish-brown flower spike, which is often covered in a dense, hairy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are designed to attract specific pollinators, including certain species of wasps. The orchid's morphology reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, with a specialized structure that facilitates pollination through mimicry."
