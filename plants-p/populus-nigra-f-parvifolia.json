It is characterized by its smaller, ovate leaves that are typically a darker green than those of the standard species. The plant is native to Europe and is often found growing near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its unique foliage."
