    "intro": "Porophyllum exsertum, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are yellow to orange in color, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Porophyllum exsertum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
