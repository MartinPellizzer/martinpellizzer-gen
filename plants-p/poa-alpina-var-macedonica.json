    "intro": "Poa alpina var. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian alpine grass, is a variant of the alpine bluegrass native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high elevations. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
