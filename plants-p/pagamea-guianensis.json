    "intro": "Pagamea guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan pagamea, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are ovate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Pagamea guianensis is often found growing along stream banks and in moist, shaded areas of the forest understory."
