    "intro": "Phegopteris brevinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has a delicate, floating frond structure with finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. The plant plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation."
