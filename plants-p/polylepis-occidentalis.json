    "intro": "Polylepis occidentalis, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy bark and compound leaves. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in racemes, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Polylepis occidentalis is considered endangered in many regions."
