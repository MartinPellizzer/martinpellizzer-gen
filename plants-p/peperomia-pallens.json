It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, which appear in clusters during the growing season. Peperomia pallens thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for tabletop displays and decorative plant arrangements."
