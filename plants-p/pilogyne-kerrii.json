    "intro": "Pilogyne kerrii, commonly known as the Kew's pilogyne, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to its foliage. Pilogyne kerrii is primarily found in shaded, humid environments, where it thrives in the undergrowth of dense forest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
