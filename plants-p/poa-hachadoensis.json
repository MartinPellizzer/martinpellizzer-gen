It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Poa hachadoensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
