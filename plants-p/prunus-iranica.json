    "intro": "Prunus iranica, commonly known as the Iranian cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Iran and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible drupes that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for cultivation in various regions. The botanical features of Prunus iranica make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
