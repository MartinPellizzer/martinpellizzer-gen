It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as agricultural fields and roadsides due to its adaptability. It produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Poissonia solanacea is also known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain environments."
