    "intro": "Pellaea angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to substrates. Pellaea angolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
