    "intro": "Pleurothallis crossota, commonly known as the Cross's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a compact rosette, contributing to its overall compact appearance. Pleurothallis crossota is often grown as a terrestrial orchid in cultivation due to its ornamental value and adaptability to specific growing conditions."
