    "intro": "Pterocephalus depressus, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to withstand drought. The plant produces small, spiky fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme, dry conditions."
