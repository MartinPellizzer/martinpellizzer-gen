    "intro": "Pedilanthus tomentellus, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Amazon, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the early morning. Its unique structure and ecological significance make it an important species in its native habitat. However, it is also known for its toxic properties, which have led to its use in traditional medicine and rituals."
