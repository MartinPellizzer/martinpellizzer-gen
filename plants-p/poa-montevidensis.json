    "intro": "Poa montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense bluegrass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly Uruguay and southern Brazil. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green blades. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa montevidensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
