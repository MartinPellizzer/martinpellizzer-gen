    "intro": "Prenia relaxata, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and glossy, while the stems are short and often produce offsets. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Prenia relaxata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
