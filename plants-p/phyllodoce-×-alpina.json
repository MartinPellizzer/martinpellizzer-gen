    "intro": "Phyllodoce \u00d7 alpina, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and alpine ecosystems. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which are usually white or pale pink. Phyllodoce \u00d7 alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed habitats."
