    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 tokyoense, commonly known as the Japanese tree fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of fronds that can reach several meters in height. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, elegant appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contribute to its reproductive cycle."
