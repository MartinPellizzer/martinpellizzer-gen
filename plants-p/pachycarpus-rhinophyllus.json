    "intro": "Pachycarpus rhinophyllus, commonly known as the horned leaf tree, is a unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, succulent leaves that store water, adapting to its often arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody structure and slow growth rate make it a long-lived species with ecological significance in its habitat. The name \"rhinophyllus\" refers to its distinctive horn-like leaf shapes, which are a key identifying feature."
