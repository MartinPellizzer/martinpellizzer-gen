    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas subsp. humile, commonly known as the humble poppy, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a white or yellow center. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 cm, with simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and have a hairy texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The seeds are contained in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
