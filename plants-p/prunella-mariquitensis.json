It is a low-growing herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. The flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
