It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes and bloom in late summer. Persicaria tenella is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
