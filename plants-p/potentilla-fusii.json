    "intro": "Potentilla fusii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla fusii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
