It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous bark has been traditionally used for making ropes and textiles, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Plagianthus divaricatus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
