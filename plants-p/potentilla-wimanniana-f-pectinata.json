    "intro": "Potentilla wimanniana f. pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The pectinate form is distinguished by its unique leaf structure, which sets it apart from other cultivars of Potentilla wimanniana."
