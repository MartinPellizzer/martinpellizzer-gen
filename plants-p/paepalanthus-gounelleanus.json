It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
