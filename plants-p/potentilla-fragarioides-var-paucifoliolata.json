    "intro": "Potentilla fragarioides var. paucifoliolata, commonly known as the slender cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy yellow flowers. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to North America, particularly found in moist, sandy soils in wetlands and along streambanks. The plant typically has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its foliage is often finely divided, with fewer leaflets compared to other varieties of Potentilla, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
