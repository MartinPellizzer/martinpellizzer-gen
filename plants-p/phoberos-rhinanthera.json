    "intro": "Phoberos rhinanthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. Its growth is slow and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
