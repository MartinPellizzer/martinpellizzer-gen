    "intro": "Pseudolaelia citrina, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that helps it store water and nutrients. Pseudolaelia citrina is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
