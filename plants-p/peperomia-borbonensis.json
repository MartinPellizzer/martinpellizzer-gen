    "intro": "Peperomia borbonensis, commonly known as the Bourbon peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
