    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy underside on its leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
