    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. albescens, commonly known as the white meadow grass, is a variant of the common tall fescue. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale green coloration, which sets it apart from the typical green foliage of other grasses. This variety is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has a tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive lawns."
