    "intro": "Plantago famarae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing a distinctive, pale greenish hue. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
