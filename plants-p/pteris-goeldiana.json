    "intro": "Pteris goeldiana, commonly known as the Goeld's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The fronds are usually green and may have a slightly glossy appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant in cultivation."
