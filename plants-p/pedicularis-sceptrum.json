    "intro": "Pedicularis sceptrum, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its flowers, which can be pink, red, or orange, are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pedicularis sceptrum is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
