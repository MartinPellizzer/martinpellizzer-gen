It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plants typically have succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help them retain moisture in their native habitat. Peremis species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their beauty and ease of care. They thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
