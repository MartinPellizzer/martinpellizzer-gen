    "intro": "Phedimus aizoon var. scaber, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features dense clusters of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in the spring. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
