    "intro": "Petasites albus, commonly known as the white edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the European Alps. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly inflorescence that resembles a dandelion, with small yellow flowers at the center. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a thick layer of white down. Petasites albus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its limited natural range."
