It is characterized by its unique, fluffy inflorescence that resembles a cloud, hence its common name. The plant features delicate, waxy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and strong winds. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Paranomus cumuliflorus is of interest to botanists due to its specialized morphology and limited distribution."
