It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clustered inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its robust and fibrous leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. Pandanus isis thrives in coastal and lowland areas, adapting well to saline and humid environments."
