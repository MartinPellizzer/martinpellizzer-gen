    "intro": "Pteris deltodon var. monstrosa, commonly known as the Variegated Shield Fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lush, feathery fronds that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and gold. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for indoor cultivation or small garden spaces. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives it its common name. This ornamental fern thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil."
