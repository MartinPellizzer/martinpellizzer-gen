    "intro": "Piper punctatum, commonly known as the spotted pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purplish or reddish tinge. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible but often used as a spice in local cuisines. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild peppery flavor."
