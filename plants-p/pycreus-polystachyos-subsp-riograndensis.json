It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, characterized by its multiple stems and spiny branches. The plant features small, paddle-shaped stems that are often ribbed and covered in clusters of spines. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
