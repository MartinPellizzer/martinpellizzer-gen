    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. octopus, commonly known as the octopus cherry, is a unique cultivar of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty bark that resembles the texture of an octopus's skin, giving it its whimsical name. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers in early spring, which are less showy than those of other cherry varieties. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its unusual bark. This cultivar is often prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its unique aesthetic appeal."
