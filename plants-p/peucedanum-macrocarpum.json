    "intro": "Peucedanum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant cowparsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, compound leaves with a distinctive pinnate structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its fruits are follicles that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
