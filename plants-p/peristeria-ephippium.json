    "intro": "Peristeria ephippium, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a unique structure, with a colorful \"upper\" part that is actually a grafted variety of the Hylocereus genus, while the lower part is the Peristeria ephippium itself. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments."
