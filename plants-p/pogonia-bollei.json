    "intro": "Pogonia bollei, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vivid pink and white petals, with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a specialized structure for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and wetlands. It has a short flowering period in late spring, producing delicate, fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pogonia bollei is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
