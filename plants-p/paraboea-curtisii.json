    "intro": "Paraboea curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's paraboea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
