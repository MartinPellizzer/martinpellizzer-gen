    "intro": "Polypodium marginellum var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid indoor gardens."
