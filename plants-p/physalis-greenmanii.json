    "intro": "Physalis greenmanii, commonly known as the goldenberry or Inca berry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America and is characterized by its distinctive lantern-shaped fruit that turns from green to yellow-orange as it matures. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The fruit is often used in culinary applications, including jams, desserts, and as a natural sweetener. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and edible plant cultivation."
