    "intro": "Polystichum fuentesii, commonly known as the Fuentes' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum fuentesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
