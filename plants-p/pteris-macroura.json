    "intro": "Pteris macroura, commonly known as the long-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are borne in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
