    "intro": "Poa hispidula, commonly known as hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa hispidula is often found in wetlands and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
