    "intro": "Polystichum cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually divided into lance-shaped segments, and the sori, which contain the spores, are arranged in a single row on the underside of the leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
