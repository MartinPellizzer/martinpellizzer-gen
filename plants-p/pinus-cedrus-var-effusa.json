    "intro": "Pinus cedrus var. effusa, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a subspecies of the cedar tree native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in pairs. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This species is valued for its aromatic wood and historical use in traditional medicine and construction."
