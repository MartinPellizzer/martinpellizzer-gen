    "intro": "Potentilla hirta f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically oval and covered with fine hairs in the wild form, but this variety is glabrous, meaning it lacks the hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
