    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas f. dentatopinnatifidum, commonly known as the toothed and pinnatifid poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The leaves are deeply lobed and serrated, with a pinnatifid pattern that gives them a unique, almost fern-like appearance. This form exhibits a more robust and rugged foliage compared to the typical Papaver rhoeas. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, similar to its parent species. The plant produces showy red-orange flowers with a white corona, typical of the Papaver genus."
