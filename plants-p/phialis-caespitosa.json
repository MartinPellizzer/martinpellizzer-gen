    "intro": "Phialis caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted phialis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grassy, often forming compact tufts that give it its common name. Phialis caespitosa is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes."
