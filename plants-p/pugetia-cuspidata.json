    "intro": "Pugetia cuspidata, commonly known as the Pacific coast holly, is a shrub native to the western coast of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Pugetia cuspidata is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
