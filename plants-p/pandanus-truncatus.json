    "intro": "Pandanus truncatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spikes at the tips of the leaves. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize coastal soils, making it useful for erosion control. The fruit, which is edible, contains a single seed encased in a fibrous husk."
