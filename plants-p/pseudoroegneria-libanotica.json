    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Pseudoroegneria libanotica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
