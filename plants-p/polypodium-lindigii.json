    "intro": "Polypodium lindigii, commonly known as the Lindig's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium lindigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
