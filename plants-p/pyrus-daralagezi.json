    "intro": "Pyrus daralagezi, commonly known as the Daralagez pear, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape with a smooth margin. It produces white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive pears. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus daralagezi is considered a critically endangered species."
