    "intro": "Potamocharis mamei, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. Potamocharis mamei is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
