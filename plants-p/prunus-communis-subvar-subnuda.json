    "intro": "Prunus communis subvar. subnuda, commonly known as the naked cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, round fruits called cherries, which are typically red or yellow when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued in gardens for its early blooming habit."
