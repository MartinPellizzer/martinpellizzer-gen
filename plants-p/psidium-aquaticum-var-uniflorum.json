    "intro": "Psidium aquaticum var. uniflorum, commonly known as the water guava, is a rare and unique variant of the water apple species. It is characterized by its aquatic habitat, typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its waterlogged surroundings. Its leaves are broad and succulent, helping to retain moisture in humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized environment, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
