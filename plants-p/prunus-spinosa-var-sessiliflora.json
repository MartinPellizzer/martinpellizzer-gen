    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. It is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
