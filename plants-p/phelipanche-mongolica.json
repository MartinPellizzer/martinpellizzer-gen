    "intro": "Phelipanche mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. Its roots form haustoria, specialized structures that attach to the roots of host plants. Phelipanche mongolica is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in association with grasses and legumes."
