    "intro": "Passiflora sidifolia, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that resemble a crown. The plant thrives in saline environments, making it well adapted to coastal dunes and sandy soils. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of pink and white, are pollinated by hummingbirds and insects. Passiflora sidifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh, maritime climates."
