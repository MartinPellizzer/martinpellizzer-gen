Its leaves are elongated and tapering, with a cuneate shape, giving the plant a striking visual appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
