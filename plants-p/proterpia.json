    "intro": "Proterpia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often followed by distinctive, triangular-shaped seed pods. Proterpia is native to regions in Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
