    "intro": "Polypodium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, which aids in its nocturnal pollination by insects."
