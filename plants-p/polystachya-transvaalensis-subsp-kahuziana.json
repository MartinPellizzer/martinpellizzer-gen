    "intro": "Polystachya transvaalensis subsp. kahuziana, commonly known as the Kahuzi bamboo, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
