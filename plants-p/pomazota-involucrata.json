    "intro": "Pomazota involucrata, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a cup-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
