    "intro": "Petrosedum erectum, commonly known as the upright stonecress, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with fleshy, upright stems covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, rounded berries. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid or rocky environments. Petrosedum erectum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
