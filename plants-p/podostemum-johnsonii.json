    "intro": "Podostemum johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's water primrose, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized roots that anchor it to submerged rocks. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in streams and rivers. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
