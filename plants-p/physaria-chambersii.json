    "intro": "Physaria chambersii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with hairy, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
