    "intro": "Poa abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its short, slender leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and often thrives in rocky or well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spikelet-like flowers. Poa abbreviata plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
