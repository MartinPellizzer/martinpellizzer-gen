    "intro": "Prunus cerasus var. rhexii, commonly known as the sour cherry or dwarf cherry, is a variety of the sweet cherry species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits that are often used in cooking and baking rather than fresh consumption. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The botanical features of this variety make it well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates."
