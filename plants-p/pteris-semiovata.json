    "intro": "Pteris semiovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to wet soil or substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators."
