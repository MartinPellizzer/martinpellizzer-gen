    "intro": "Pterophorus strictus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed plume moth, is a small moth species belonging to the family Pterophoridae. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow wings that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant it is associated with is the common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), on which it lays its eggs. The larvae feed on the leaves of this plant, causing minor damage but generally not posing a significant threat to the host. This species is commonly found in meadows and grasslands across Europe and parts of Asia."
