    "intro": "Plectranthus ternatus, commonly known as the silverleaf plectranthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or lavender in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Plectranthus ternatus is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
