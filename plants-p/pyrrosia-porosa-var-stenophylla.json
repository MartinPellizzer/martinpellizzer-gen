    "intro": "Pyrrosia porosa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
