    "intro": "Platystele kayi, commonly known as the Kay's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its unique, translucent green leaves and striking white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on specialized structures called pseudobulbs for water and nutrient storage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Platystele kayi is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
