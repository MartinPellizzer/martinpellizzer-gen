    "intro": "Pitcairnia steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
