    "intro": "Piptocarpha leprosa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Piptocarpha leprosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
