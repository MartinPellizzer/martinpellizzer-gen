    "intro": "Panicum hirtiglume, commonly known as the hairy lemma panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets with hairy lemmas. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Panicum hirtiglume is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
