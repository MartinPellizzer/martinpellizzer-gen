    "intro": "Psychrogeton sphaeroxylus, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and southern South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in cold, arid conditions, often found on rocky substrates. Its small, white flowers are adapted to the harsh climate, blooming during the brief summer months. The plant has a compact structure with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its nutrient-poor environment. Psychrogeton sphaeroxylus plays a vital role in the ecological stability of its extreme habitat."
