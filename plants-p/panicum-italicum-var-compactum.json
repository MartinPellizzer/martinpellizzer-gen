    "intro": "Panicum italicum var. compactum, commonly known as dwarf fountain grass, is a compact, ornamental grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like blades that form a dense, rounded clump, typically growing to a height of about 12 to 18 inches. The plant produces delicate, feathery plumes that add visual interest during the late summer and autumn months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice in xeriscaping."
