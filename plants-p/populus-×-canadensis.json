    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis, commonly known as the Canada poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is widely used in reforestation and ornamental landscaping."
