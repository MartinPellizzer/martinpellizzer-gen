    "intro": "Populus parvidentata, commonly known as the small-toothed poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have finely toothed margins, which give it its common name. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in moist, temperate forests and riparian zones."
