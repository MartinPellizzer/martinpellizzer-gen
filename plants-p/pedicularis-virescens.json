    "intro": "Pedicularis virescens, commonly known as the green lady's slipper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes several species of parasitic and semi-parasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers, which are typically green or yellowish in color, and its basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation."
