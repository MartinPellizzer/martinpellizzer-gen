    "intro": "Pleurothallis grobyi, commonly known as the Groby's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a small epiphytic orchid with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring, producing clusters of white to pale yellow petals with a subtle pinkish hue. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
