    "intro": "Portulaca umbraticola, commonly known as the shade portulaca, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent plant with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Portulaca umbraticola is drought-tolerant and is used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
