    "intro": "Phyllostachys rubromarginata f. castigata, commonly known as the red-edged bamboo, is a variant of the red marginated bamboo, characterized by its distinctive red margins on the leaf blades. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to eastern Asia, particularly China. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters, with slender, green culms that have a reddish tint at the base. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and exhibit a striking contrast between the bright green midrib and the reddish margins. This ornamental bamboo is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is valued in both traditional and modern horticulture."
