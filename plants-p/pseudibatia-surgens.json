    "intro": "Pseudibatia surgens, commonly known as the climbing false hellebore, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces dark green, arrow-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and emits a strong, unpleasant odor. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale green and bloom in late spring. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
