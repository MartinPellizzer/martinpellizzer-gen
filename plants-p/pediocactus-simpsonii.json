    "intro": "Pediocactus simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
