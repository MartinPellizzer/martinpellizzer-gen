    "intro": "Pleione anceps, commonly known as the white pleione, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periods of drought. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Pleione anceps is prized in horticulture for its beauty and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
