It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated.
