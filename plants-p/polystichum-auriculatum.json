    "intro": "Polystichum auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum auriculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
