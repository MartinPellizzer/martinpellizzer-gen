    "intro": "Pyrus oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf pear, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible fruit that is similar to common pears but is less widely cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
