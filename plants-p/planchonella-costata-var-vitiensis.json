    "intro": "Planchonella costata var. vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis native plum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Vanuatu, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or lowland forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
