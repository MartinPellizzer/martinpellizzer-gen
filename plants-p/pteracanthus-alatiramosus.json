    "intro": "Pteracanthus alatiramosus, commonly known as the silver-winged fern, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive foliage. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, and its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones located at the base of the leaves."
