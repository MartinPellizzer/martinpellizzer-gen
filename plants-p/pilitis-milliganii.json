    "intro": "Pilitis milliganii, commonly known as the Milligan's piltis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many shrubs and grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, adapted for wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pilitis milliganii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
