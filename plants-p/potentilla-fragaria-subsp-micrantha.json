    "intro": "Potentilla fragaria subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
