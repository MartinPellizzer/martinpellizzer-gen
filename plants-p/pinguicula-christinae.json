    "intro": "Pinguicula christinae, commonly known as the Mexican butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that aids in pollination. Pinguicula christinae is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in humid conditions with well-draining soil."
