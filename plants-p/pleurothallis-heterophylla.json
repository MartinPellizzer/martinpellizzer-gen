    "intro": "Pleurothallis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and are pollinated by insects and small birds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
