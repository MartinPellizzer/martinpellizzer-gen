    "intro": "Pleopeltis schomburgkiana, commonly known as the Schomburgk's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks and rocky surfaces. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
