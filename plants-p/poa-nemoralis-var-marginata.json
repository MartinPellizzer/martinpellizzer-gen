    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. marginata, commonly known as the marginsweet bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silver or white margin, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. This variety is often found in association with other woodland flora and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
