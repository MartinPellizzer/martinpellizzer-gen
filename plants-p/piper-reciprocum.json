    "intro": "Piper reciprocum, commonly known as the reciprocal pepper, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes various species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns red when mature, and it is used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
