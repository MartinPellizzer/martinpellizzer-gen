    "intro": "Podolepis rutidochlamys, commonly known as the rough-leaved everlet, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are leathery and have a rough texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid habitat. It grows in rocky outcrops and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
