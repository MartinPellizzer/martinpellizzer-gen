    "intro": "Panicum commutatum, commonly known as yellow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
