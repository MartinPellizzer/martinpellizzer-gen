    "intro": "Platanthera rumphii, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in some regions."
