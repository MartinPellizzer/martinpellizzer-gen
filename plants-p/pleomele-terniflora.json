    "intro": "Pleomele terniflora, commonly known as the three-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, giving the plant a dramatic appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a rare and valuable species."
