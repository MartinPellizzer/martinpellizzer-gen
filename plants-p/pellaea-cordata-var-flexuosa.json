    "intro": "Pellaea cordata var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible heart fern, is a variant of the heart fern characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often arching fronds. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly notched base, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses due to its elegant appearance and adaptability."
