    "intro": "Poa scaberula var. nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flowered bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, giving it its \"nudiflora\" designation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
