    "intro": "Potentilla leuconota var. brachyphyllaria, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
