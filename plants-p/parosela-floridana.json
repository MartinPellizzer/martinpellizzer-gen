    "intro": "Parosela floridana, commonly known as the Florida parosela, is a rare and critically endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near waterways in Florida. It produces small white to pale yellow flowers and has a distinctive, slender, branching stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
