    "intro": "Pedicularis oederi subsp. genuina, commonly known as the Alpine beard tongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
