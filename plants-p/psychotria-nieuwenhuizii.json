    "intro": "Psychotria nieuwenhuizii, commonly known as the dwarf psychotria, is a flowering plant species native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
