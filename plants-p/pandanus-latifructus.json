    "intro": "Pandanus latifructus, commonly known as the broad-fruited pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into long, narrow fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be woven into mats and baskets. Pandanus latifructus thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, humid environments."
