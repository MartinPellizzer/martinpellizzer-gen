    "intro": "Polygala stenopetala subsp. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, often yellow or greenish flowers clustered in dense spikes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
