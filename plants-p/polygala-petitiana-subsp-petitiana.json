    "intro": "Polygala petitiana subsp. petitiana, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or scrublands. The plant features slender stems with small, pale green to yellowish leaves, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters. It is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in Mediterranean climates. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
