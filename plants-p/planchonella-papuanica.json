    "intro": "Planchonella papuanica, commonly known as the Papuan satinash, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Papua and nearby islands. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its family."
