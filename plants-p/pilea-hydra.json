    "intro": "Pilea hydra, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged. Pilea hydra plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
