It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in montane forests. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds and insects. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
