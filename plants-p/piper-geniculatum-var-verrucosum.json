    "intro": "Piper geniculatum var. verrucosum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed pepper plant, is a variant of the genus Piper native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Piper species, particularly in its unique stem morphology. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has limited use in traditional medicine."
