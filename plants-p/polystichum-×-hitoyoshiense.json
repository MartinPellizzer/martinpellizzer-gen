    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 hitoyoshiense, commonly known as the Hitoyoshi fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
