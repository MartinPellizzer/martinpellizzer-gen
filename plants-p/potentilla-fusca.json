    "intro": "Potentilla fusca, commonly known as the black potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Potentilla fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
