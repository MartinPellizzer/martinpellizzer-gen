It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn bright red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit and vibrant seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
