    "intro": "Psoralea prodiens, commonly known as the prodiens psoralea, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are characteristic of the genus Psoralea. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
