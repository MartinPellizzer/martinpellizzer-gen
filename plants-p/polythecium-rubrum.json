    "intro": "Polythecium rubrum, commonly known as the red-spored polypore, is a member of the fungal kingdom, not the plant kingdom. It is a wood-decaying fungus that typically grows on dead or decaying hardwoods. The fruiting body of this fungus is characterized by its rough, sponge-like cap and reddish-brown spore masses. It plays an important ecological role in breaking down organic matter in forest ecosystems. However, it is not a plant and therefore does not have botanical features such as leaves, roots, or flowers."
