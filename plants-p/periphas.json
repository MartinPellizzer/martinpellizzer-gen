    "intro": "Periphas, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a short lifespan, often only living for a few weeks, and is known for its elusive nature, making it difficult to study in the wild. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, and it thrives in cool, humid environments. Due to its rarity and unique blooming habits, the Periphas is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of fascination for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
