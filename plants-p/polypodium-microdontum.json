    "intro": "Polypodium microdontum, commonly known as the small-toothed polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome often covered in a dense mat of roots. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium. Polypodium microdontum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
