    "intro": "Pteris alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, swamps, and other wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Pteris alabamensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
