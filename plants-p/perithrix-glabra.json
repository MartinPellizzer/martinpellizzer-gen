    "intro": "Perithrix glabra, commonly known as the smooth perithrix, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
