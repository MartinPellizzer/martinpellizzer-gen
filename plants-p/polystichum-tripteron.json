    "intro": "Polystichum tripteron, commonly known as the three-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with a distinctive shield-shaped rachis. The leaves are typically divided into three lobes, giving the plant its common name, and are covered in a fine layer of silvery-white hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
