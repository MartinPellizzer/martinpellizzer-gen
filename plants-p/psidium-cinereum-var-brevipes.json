    "intro": "Psidium cinereum var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stalked guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. The fruit is generally smaller than the common guava and has a sweeter, more acidic flavor."
