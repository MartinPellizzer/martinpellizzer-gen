    "intro": "Polygala pseudosenega, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential use in traditional medicine."
