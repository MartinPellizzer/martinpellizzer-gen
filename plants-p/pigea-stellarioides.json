    "intro": "Pigea stellarioides, commonly known as the star-like chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, thread-like trichomes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly succulent texture, adapted to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. Pigea stellarioides is often found in alpine environments, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
