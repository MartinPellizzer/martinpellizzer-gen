    "intro": "Parosela pazensis, commonly known as the Pazentis parosela, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found at elevations between 1,200 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela pazensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
