    "intro": "Pyracantha chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for hedges and ornamental landscaping. Pyracantha chinensis is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resistance to pests and diseases."
