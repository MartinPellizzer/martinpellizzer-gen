    "intro": "Poa mataniae, commonly known as the Matanai grass, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in southern South America. It is a perennial grass that thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spikelet-based flowers are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Poa mataniae is considered a species of conservation concern."
