    "intro": "Pinus microcarpa, commonly known as the Philippine pine or carabao's pine, is a species of conifer native to the Philippines. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a conical crown. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing, which aids in wind dispersal. Its needles are long, slender, and arranged in bundles of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. Pinus microcarpa is valued for its timber and is often planted for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal."
