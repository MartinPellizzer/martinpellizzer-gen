    "intro": "Polypodium pyrrhorhachis, commonly known as the red-stemmed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish or reddish scales. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while also storing water and nutrients. The fronds are usually divided into segments, with the fertile ones bearing spore-producing structures on the underside."
