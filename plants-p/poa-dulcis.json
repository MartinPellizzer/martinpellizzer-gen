    "intro": "Poa dulcis, commonly known as sweet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that emit a sweet, honey-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Sweet grass is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its aromatic properties have made it culturally significant in various indigenous traditions."
