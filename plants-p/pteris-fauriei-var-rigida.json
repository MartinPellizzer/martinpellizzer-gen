    "intro": "Pteris fauriei var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rigid, upright growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
