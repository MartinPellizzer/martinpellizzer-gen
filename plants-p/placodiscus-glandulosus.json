    "intro": "Placodiscus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky disc lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It has a thick, leathery thallus with a dense, granular upper surface and a more loosely structured lower cortex. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species in forest ecosystems."
