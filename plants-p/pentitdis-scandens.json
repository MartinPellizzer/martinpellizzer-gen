    "intro": "Pentitdis scandens, commonly known as the climbing pentitdis, is a vine-like plant characterized by its flexible stems that allow it to climb and spread across surfaces. It typically features small, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, depending on the variety. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds. Pentitdis scandens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
