    "intro": "Parabaena megalocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited parabaena, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by large, fleshy fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
