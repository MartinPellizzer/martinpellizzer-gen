It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and large, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, spadix-like inflorescences that are often covered in a dense, fibrous covering. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material, and the plant is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance in tropical ecosystems."
