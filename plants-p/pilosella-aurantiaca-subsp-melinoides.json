    "intro": "Pilosella aurantiaca subsp. melinoides, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies melinoides is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Pilosella aurantiaca. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and grasslands. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
