    "intro": "Pleocnemia malayensis, commonly known as the Malay pleocnemia, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
