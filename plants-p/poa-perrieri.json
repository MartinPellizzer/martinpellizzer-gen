    "intro": "Poa perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-rowed florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa perrieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
