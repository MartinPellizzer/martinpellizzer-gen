It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, finger-like segments that give it a lacy appearance. Pteris biaurita is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
