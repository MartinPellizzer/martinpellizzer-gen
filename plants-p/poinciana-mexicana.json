    "intro": "Poinciana mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking, feathery, flame-colored flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. The plant has compound leaves that are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to provide shade in urban and suburban landscapes."
