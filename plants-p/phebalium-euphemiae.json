It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and dense, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is typically found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
