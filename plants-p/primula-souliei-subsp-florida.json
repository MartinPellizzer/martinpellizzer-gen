It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, which bloom in early spring. It has a compact growth habit and is well-suited for woodland gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more robust stems compared to other Primula species."
