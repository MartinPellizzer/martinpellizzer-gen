    "intro": "Polystachya mildbraedii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf polystachya, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in humid, low-light conditions."
