    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or compact cherry, is a small shrub or tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact size and seasonal interest. The variety is particularly suited to smaller spaces due to its slow growth and hardy nature."
