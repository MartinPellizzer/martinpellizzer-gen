    "intro": "Puccinellia ciliata, commonly known as coastal wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in stabilizing sandy shores. Puccinellia ciliata plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing dune structures."
