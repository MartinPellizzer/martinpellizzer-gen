    "intro": "Phyllanthus platycalyx var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and for erosion control in degraded landscapes."
