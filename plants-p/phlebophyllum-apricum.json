    "intro": "Phlebophyllum apricum, commonly known as the spring fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that unfurl in early spring, giving it a fresh, verdant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread gradually across the forest floor. Phlebophyllum apricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add texture to woodland gardens."
