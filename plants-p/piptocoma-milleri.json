    "intro": "Piptocoma milleri, commonly known as the Christmas tree bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, dark green foliage with leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal landscaping. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
