    "intro": "Prosaptia samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan banyan, is a tropical plant native to the islands of Samoa. It is a member of the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and can grow into a tree with a broad, spreading canopy. It produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are an important food source for local wildlife. The roots of Prosaptia samoensis are known to form a network that helps stabilize the soil in its native habitat."
