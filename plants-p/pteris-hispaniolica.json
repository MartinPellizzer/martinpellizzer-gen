    "intro": "Pteris hispaniolica, commonly known as the Hispaniola water fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris hispaniolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
