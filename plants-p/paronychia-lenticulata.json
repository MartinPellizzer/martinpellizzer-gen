    "intro": "Paronychia lenticulata, commonly known as the lens-shaped moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, overlapping leaves that are often curved. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore capsules are usually urn-shaped and positioned at the tips of the stems. Paronychia lenticulata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
