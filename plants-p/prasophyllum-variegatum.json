    "intro": "Prasophyllum variegatum, commonly known as the variable leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in heathland and swampy areas, preferring moist, acidic soils. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, tubular leaf and is often found in the southeastern regions of Australia. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some areas."
