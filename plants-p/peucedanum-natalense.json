    "intro": "Peucedanum natalense, commonly known as Natal cowbane, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along riverbanks, thriving in temperate climates. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans."
