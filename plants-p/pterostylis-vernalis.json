    "intro": "Pterostylis vernalis, commonly known as the vernal star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy greenish-white flower. Its unique floral structure includes a labellum that resembles a star, contributing to its common name. Pterostylis vernalis is pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to its scent and appearance."
