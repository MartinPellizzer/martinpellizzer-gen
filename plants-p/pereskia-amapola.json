    "intro": "Pereskia amapola, commonly known as the \"Mexican snowball\" or \"star apple,\" is a unique cactus species native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems covered in soft, leafy structures that resemble leaves, making it appear more like a shrub than a typical cactus. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a snowball, hence its common name. Its fruits are small, round, and edible, with a sweet, juicy pulp that has a mild, tropical flavor. Despite its cactus classification, Pereskia amapola is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
