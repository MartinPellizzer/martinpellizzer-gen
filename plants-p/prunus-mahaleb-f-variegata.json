    "intro": "Prunus mahaleb f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated cherry or variegated mahaleb cherry, is a decorative shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its attractive, variegated leaves that display shades of white, yellow, and green, creating a striking visual effect. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries that are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its fruit yield."
