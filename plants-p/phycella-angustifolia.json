It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
