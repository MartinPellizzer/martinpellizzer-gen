    "intro": "Pepo okeechobeensis, commonly known as the Okeechobee pumpkin, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Everglades of Florida. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, gourds, and squash. The plant produces large, spherical fruits with a thick, tough rind and a sweet, edible flesh. Its botanical features are adapted to the wetland environment, with fibrous roots that help stabilize it in waterlogged soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
