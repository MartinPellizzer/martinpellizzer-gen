It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces achenes as its fruit type. Pterolepis stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and seasonal blooms."
