    "intro": "Psammotropha alternifolia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Psammotropha alternifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
