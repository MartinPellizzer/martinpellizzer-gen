    "intro": "Prasophyllum elmae, commonly known as the Elmae leek orchid, is an endemic species native to the alpine regions of Tasmania. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flowering stem. The flowers are typically greenish-white with a distinct, elongated lip, and they bloom during the spring months. This orchid thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
