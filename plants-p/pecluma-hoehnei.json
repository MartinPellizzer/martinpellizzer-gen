    "intro": "Pecluma hoehnei, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green inflorescences that are arranged in dense clusters, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Pecluma hoehnei is often found in moist, well-drained soils in grasslands and woodland margins."
