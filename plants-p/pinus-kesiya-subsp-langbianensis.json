    "intro": "Pinus kesiya subsp. langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a coniferous tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. The cones of this subspecies are relatively small and mature within a single growing season. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
