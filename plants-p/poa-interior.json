    "intro": "Poa interior, commonly known as the inland grass or mountain grass, is a species of grass found in various regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and typically thrives in cooler, moist environments. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it conserve water in its native habitat. Poa interior is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
