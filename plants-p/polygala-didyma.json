    "intro": "Polygala didyma, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Polygala didyma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
