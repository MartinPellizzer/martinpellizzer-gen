    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum perangustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paraprasophyllum, is a unique member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, typical of many shrubs in its native habitat. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
