    "intro": "Phaeocordylis areolata, commonly known as the spotted coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. The plant produces a cluster of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are specialized to form symbiotic relationships with fungi, which is a key feature of its botanical structure. The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
