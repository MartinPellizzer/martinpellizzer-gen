It produces small, sweet, red fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has dense, dark green foliage and a unique, spherical growth habit that makes it visually striking. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and compact size. The flowers are white and appear in early spring, preceding the fruiting season."
