    "intro": "Podocarpus nivalis var. erectus, commonly known as the silver pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural planting in temperate regions."
