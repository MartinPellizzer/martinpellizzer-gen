    "intro": "Plantago kerstenii, commonly known as the Kersten's plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating and produces small, greenish flowers in spikes. It is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across its native range."
