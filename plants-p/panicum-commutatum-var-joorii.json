The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically golden to reddish in color, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ecological restoration and ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
