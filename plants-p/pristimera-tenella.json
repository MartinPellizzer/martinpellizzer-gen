It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in whorls along the stems. Pristimera tenella is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats."
