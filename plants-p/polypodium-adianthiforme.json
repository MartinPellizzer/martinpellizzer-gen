    "intro": "Polypodium adianthiforme, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are also sometimes used as a natural indicator of water quality due to their sensitivity to environmental changes."
