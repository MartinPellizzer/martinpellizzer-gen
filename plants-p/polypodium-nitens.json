    "intro": "Polypodium nitens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium nitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
