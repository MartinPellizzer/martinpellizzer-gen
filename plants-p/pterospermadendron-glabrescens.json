    "intro": "Pterospermadendron glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved pterospermum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that dehisce to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental potential and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
