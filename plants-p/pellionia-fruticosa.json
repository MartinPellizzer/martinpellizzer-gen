    "intro": "Pellionia fruticosa, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Pellionia fruticosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
