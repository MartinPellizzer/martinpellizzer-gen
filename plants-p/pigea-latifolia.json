    "intro": "Pigea latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf pigeonwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Pigea latifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
