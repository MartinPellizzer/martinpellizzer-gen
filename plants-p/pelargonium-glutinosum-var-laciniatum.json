    "intro": "Pelargonium glutinosum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the sticky leaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are covered in a sticky, glandular substance. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
