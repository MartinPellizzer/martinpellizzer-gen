    "intro": "Pleiocarpidia parvistipula, commonly known as the small-stipitate pleiocarpidia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
