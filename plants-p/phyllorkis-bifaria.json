    "intro": "Phyllorkis bifaria, commonly known as the two-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, stocky stem with two leaves, from which the name \"bifaria\" is derived. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
