It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert washes. It has adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system and succulent leaves. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
