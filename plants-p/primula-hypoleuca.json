    "intro": "Primula hypoleuca, commonly known as the white primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Primula hypoleuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
