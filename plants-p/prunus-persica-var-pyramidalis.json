    "intro": "Prunus persica var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid plum, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit. It produces small, yellowish-orange fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has a dense, conical shape, making it suitable for small spaces and ornamental purposes. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, providing visual interest throughout the growing season. The pyramid plum is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated for commercial fruit production compared to other peach varieties."
