It is native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers with long, spurred petals that attract specific pollinators. It is a hemiparasitic plant, relying on host plants for some of its nutrients. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
