    "intro": "Pteris obscura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris obscura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to purify water in aquatic gardens."
