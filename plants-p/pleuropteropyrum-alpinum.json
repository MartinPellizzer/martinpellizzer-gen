    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine pleuropteropyrum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and some toxic plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, where it thrives in cold, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and fern-like, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh climates. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
