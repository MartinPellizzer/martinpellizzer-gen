    "intro": "Polemonium reptans var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the broadleaf Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and is often found in rich, humusy soils. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the genus Polemonium, which is part of the Polemoniaceae family."
