    "intro": "Panicum colonum var. pseudocolonum, commonly known as eastern gammogreen, is a variant of the panic grass genus native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for other grasses, and it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
