    "intro": "Phlebodium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a distinctive frond structure with a thick, leathery rachis and dichotomous branching. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
