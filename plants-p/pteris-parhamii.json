    "intro": "Pteris parhamii, commonly known as the Parham's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia along the margins of the fronds. Pteris parhamii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
