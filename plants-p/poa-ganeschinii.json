    "intro": "Poa ganeschinii, commonly known as Ganesch's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a low-growing perennial plant with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
