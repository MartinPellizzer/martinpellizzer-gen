    "intro": "Phleum haenkeanum, commonly known as tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Phleum haenkeanum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in forage and erosion control."
