    "intro": "Polypogon monspeliensis subsp. maritimus, commonly known as the maritime grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and periodic flooding. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is of ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
