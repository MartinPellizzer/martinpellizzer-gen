    "intro": "Prunus subcylindracea, commonly known as the narrow-cylindrical cherry, is a species of flowering shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its elegant form and seasonal blooms. Prunus subcylindracea is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
