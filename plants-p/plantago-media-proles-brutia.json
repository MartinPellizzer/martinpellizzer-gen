It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
