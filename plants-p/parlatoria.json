    "intro": "Parlatoria, commonly known as the \"whispering plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped or tubular flowers, often in shades of blue, violet, or white. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. Parlatoria species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive blooms and foliage."
