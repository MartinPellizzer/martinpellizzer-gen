It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, and consists of several species that are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The plants are characterized by their showy, butterfly-shaped flowers, which give the genus its name. They typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants, thriving in humid, shaded environments.
