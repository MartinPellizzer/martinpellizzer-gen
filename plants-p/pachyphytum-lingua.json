    "intro": "Pachyphytum lingua, commonly known as the \"tongue plant,\" is a succulent native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, storing water to help it survive in arid conditions. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
