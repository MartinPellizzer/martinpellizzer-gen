It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often as a shrub or perennial herb. Its unique morphology and adaptability to harsh conditions make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
