    "intro": "Potentilla reptans hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to July. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are palmately divided into five lobes, often covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
