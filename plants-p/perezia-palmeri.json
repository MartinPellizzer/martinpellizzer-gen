    "intro": "Perezia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's perezia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
