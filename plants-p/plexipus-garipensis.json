    "intro": "Plexipus garipensis, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, showy blossom that is typically pink or white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
