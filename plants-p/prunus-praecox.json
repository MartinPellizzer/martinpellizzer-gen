    "intro": "Prunus praecox, commonly known as the early cherry or dwarf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It produces small, edible fruits that ripen early in the growing season, typically in late spring. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and white to pale pink flowers that bloom before the leaves appear. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Prunus praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
