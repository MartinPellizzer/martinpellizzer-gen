    "intro": "Pseudosbeckia swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton's false beakweed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its foliage is usually covered in fine, hairy textures. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
