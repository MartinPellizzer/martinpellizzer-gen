    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 geranioides, commonly known as the geranium hybrid, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant features palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
