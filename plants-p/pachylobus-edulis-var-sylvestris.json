    "intro": "Pachylobus edulis var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild edible orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender stems and delicate, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, often used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
