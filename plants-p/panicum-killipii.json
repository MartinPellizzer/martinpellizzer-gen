    "intro": "Panicum killipii, commonly known as Killip's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces fluffy, pale green to golden spikelets that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. Panicum killipii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
