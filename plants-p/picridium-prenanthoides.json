It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
