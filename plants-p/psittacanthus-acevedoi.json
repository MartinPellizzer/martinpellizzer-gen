    "intro": "Psittacanthus acevedoi, commonly known as the Acevedo's bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
