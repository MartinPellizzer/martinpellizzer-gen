    "intro": "Prunus avium var. silvestris, commonly known as the wild cherry, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by small, dark red cherries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are ovate with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
