It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense canopy of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
