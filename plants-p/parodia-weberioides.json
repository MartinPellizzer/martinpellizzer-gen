    "intro": "Parodia weberioides, commonly known as the Weber's pincushion cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, cylindrical cactus with a ribbed structure that helps it store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Parodia weberioides thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
