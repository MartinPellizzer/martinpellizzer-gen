It belongs to the family Apostichopodidae and is characterized by its distinctive dark coloration and elongated arms. This deep-sea organism thrives in cold, oxygen-rich waters and is often found on the seafloor. Its anatomy includes a central disc and flexible arms that aid in movement and feeding. Pseudoliparis atrobrachiata plays a role in deep-sea ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for larger marine predators."
