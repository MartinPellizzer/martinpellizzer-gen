    "intro": "Palicourea sanblasensis, commonly known as the San Blas palicourea, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
