    "intro": "Piper atrospicum, commonly known as black pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. The berries contain tiny, black seeds that are used as a spice, similar to black pepper. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests."
