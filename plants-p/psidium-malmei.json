    "intro": "Psidium malmei, commonly known as the Malme's guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are typically small, round, and have a thin, smooth skin, containing a sweet, aromatic pulp. Psidium malmei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has limited use in culinary applications compared to other guava species."
