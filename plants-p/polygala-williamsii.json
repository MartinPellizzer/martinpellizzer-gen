    "intro": "Polygala williamsii, commonly known as Williams' milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Polygala williamsii is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
