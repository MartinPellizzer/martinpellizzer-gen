    "intro": "Pinus leioclada, commonly known as the smooth bark pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, distinguishing it from other pine species. Pinus leioclada is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments."
