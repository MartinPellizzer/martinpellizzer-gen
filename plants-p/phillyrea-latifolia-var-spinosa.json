    "intro": "Phillyrea latifolia var. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny Phillyrea, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This variety is distinguished by its thorny stems, which give it a rugged appearance and help deter herbivores."
