    "intro": "Primula villosa f. norica, commonly known as the Noric Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
