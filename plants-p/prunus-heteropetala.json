It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that vary in shape, often being ovate to elliptic with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are small drupes that turn red when mature, containing a single hard seed. Prunus heteropetala is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
