    "intro": "Pereskia higuerana, commonly known as the Guayabilla or West Indian hibiscus, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often mistaken for leaves, which are actually modified stems. The plant produces large, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of yellow or orange, followed by orange or red fruits. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and the plant is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Pereskia higuerana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
