It features narrow, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. Phillyrea decora is valued for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
