    "intro": "Platanthera roseotincta, commonly known as the rose-tinctured twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, pale pink or white flower. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and swampy areas. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
