    "intro": "Pedilonum mohlianum, commonly known as the Mohlian's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, aiding its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
