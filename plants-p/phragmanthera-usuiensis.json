    "intro": "Phragmanthera usuiensis, commonly known as the Usui's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
