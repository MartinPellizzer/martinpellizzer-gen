    "intro": "Piper robleanum, commonly known as the Robleanum pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, vine-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a glossy surface with a distinct aroma. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and the plant produces small, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine and cuisine."
