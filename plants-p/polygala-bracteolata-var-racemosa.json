    "intro": "Polygala bracteolata var. racemosa, commonly known as the racemose polygala, is a flowering plant native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The racemose inflorescence, from which the variety is named, consists of a series of small, clustered flowers along a central axis."
