It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broad and ribbed. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a dense cluster, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
