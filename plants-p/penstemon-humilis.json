    "intro": "Penstemon humilis, commonly known as the low penstemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, dry, and sunny environments, often found in alpine and arid regions. The plant features slender, upright stems and produces tubular, two-lipped flowers that are usually pink to purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. Penstemon humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, low-nutrient soils."
