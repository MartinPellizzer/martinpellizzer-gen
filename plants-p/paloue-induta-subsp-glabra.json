It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The subspecies glabra is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, which set it apart from other subspecies of Paloue. It typically grows in grassland habitats and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment."
