It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
