    "intro": "Pinus mughus, commonly known as the Eastern Himalayan pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows at high altitudes, often in cold and moist environments, which contribute to its hardy nature. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in clusters, providing efficient photosynthesis in its native habitat. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rugged terrain. The bark of Pinus mughus is thick and fissured, offering protection against harsh weather conditions and pests."
