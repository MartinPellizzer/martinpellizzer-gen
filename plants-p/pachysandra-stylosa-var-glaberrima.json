    "intro": "Pachysandra stylosa var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-leaf pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming growth with dark green, ovate leaves that are smooth and shiny. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value lies in its lush foliage and ability to suppress weeds in shaded garden settings."
