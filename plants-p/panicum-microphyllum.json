    "intro": "Panicum microphyllum, commonly known as littleleaf panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of pollen. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
