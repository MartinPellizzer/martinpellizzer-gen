    "intro": "Pelea hiiakae, commonly known as the Hawaiian pelea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas or on rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pelea hiiakae is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
