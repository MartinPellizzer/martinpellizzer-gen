    "intro": "Pteris wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's brake, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the leaves. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities."
