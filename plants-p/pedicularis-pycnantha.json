    "intro": "Pedicularis pycnantha, commonly known as the clustered monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble orchids. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. Its striking red and yellow flowers bloom in late summer, making it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems."
