It is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable ornamental and a potential invasive species. Botanically, it belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique floral structures and often ornamental value."
