    "intro": "Pentalophus mandanensis, commonly known as the Mandan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the central United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Pentalophus mandanensis plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and historical significance."
