    "intro": "Primula scullyi, commonly known as the Scully's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Primula scullyi is considered a rare and endangered species."
