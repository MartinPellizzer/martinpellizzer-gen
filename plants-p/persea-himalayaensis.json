It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, orange-yellow fruits that are edible when fully ripe. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a humid environment. Due to its ornamental value and limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and underutilized species in horticulture."
