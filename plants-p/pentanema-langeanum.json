    "intro": "Pentanema langeanum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often display a yellowish or golden hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. The golden cup fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
