It consists of several species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with opposite, simple leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Pseudosalacia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
