    "intro": "Phyllanthus pinjenensis, commonly known as the Pinjen stonecress, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Phyllanthus pinjenensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny habitats."
