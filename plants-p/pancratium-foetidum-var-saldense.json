    "intro": "Pancratium foetidum var. saldense, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a bulbous stem that stores nutrients. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
