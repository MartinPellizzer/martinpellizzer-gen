    "intro": "Pitcairnia leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. Pitcairnia leopoldii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
