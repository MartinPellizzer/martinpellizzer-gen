    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. flavidum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds with a distinctive golden-yellow margin. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically leathery and can reach lengths of up to 60 cm, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
