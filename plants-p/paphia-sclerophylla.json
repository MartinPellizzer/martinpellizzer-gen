    "intro": "Paphia sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are thick and leathery, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
