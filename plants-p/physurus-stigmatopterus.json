It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are typically divided into segments, giving it a lacy appearance. Physurus stigmatopterus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
