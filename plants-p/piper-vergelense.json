    "intro": "Piper vergelense, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often have a spicy taste. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
