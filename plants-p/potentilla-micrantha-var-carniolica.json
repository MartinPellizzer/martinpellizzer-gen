The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, and its stems are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
