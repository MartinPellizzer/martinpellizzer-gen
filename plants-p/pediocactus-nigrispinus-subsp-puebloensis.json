    "intro": "Pediocactus nigrispinus subsp. puebloensis, commonly known as the Pueblo prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and full sun exposure. This subspecies is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for desert gardens and xeriscaping."
