    "intro": "Psilodigera, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces, especially on sandstone. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. Psilodigera is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. This lichen plays a crucial role in soil formation and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
