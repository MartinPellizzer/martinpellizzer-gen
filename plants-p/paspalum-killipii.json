    "intro": "Paspalum killipii, commonly known as the Killip's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Paspalum killipii plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is of interest for its ecological resilience."
