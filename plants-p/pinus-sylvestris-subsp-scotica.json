    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. scotica, commonly known as the Scottish pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the British Isles. It is a tall evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structures. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed capsules. Its needles are typically longer and more slender compared to other pine subspecies, and it has a distinct, often rugged appearance. This subspecies is adapted to the cooler, windier climates of its native habitat."
