    "intro": "Phaca tragacantha, commonly known as the goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a distinctive, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a sizing agent for textiles. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland and scrub habitats. Phaca tragacantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique appearance."
