    "intro": "Panicum montanum var. merrillii, commonly known as the mountain panicgrass, is a variant of the panic grass genus native to specific regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or low clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and prairies. Due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
