    "intro": "Pristiglottis mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a thalloid structure, which consists of a flattened, ribbon-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms. Pristiglottis mindanaensis is native to the Philippines, particularly the island of Mindanao, where it is often found in forest understories."
