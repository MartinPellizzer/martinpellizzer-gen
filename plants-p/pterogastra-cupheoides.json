    "intro": "Pterogastra cupheoides, commonly known as the African cuphea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
