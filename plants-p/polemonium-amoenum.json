    "intro": "Polemonium amoenum, commonly known as the white Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its common name reflects the ladder-like arrangement of its leaves, which are often adorned with fine, thread-like veins."
