    "intro": "Padus serotina pyramidalis, commonly known as the late-fruiting pyramidal hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape and thorny branches, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces white to pink flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in autumn. This species is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
