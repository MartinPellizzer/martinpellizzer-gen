    "intro": "Panicum pseudodurva var. gracillimum, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a grass species native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as fields and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. This variety is often distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and more delicate appearance compared to other Panicum species."
