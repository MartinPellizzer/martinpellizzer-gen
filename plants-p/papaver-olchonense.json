    "intro": "Papaver olchonense, commonly known as the Olchon poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, while the flowers bloom in early summer. The seeds are contained in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
