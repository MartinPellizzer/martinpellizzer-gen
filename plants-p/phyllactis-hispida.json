    "intro": "Phyllactis hispida, commonly known as the rough phyllactis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough appearance. Phyllactis hispida is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
