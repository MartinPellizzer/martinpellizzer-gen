    "intro": "Pteris oshimensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are bipinnate, with fine, tooth-like divisions that give it a delicate appearance. Pteris oshimensis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
