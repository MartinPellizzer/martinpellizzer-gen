    "intro": "Paspalum denticulatum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, soft-textured foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
