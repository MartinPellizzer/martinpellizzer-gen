    "intro": "Peucedanum parnassicum, commonly known as the Alpine cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family. Peucedanum parnassicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
