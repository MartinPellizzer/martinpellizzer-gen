    "intro": "Pitcairnia flavescens, commonly known as the golden pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that appear in clusters, often surrounded by long, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a water-holding structure, which helps it thrive in its natural habitat. Pitcairnia flavescens is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting various insect and bird species."
