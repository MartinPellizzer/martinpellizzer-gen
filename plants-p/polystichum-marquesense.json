    "intro": "Polystichum marquesense, commonly known as the Marquesan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Mo'orea in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
