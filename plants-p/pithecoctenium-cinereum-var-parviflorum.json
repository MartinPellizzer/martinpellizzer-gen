    "intro": "Pithecoctenium cinereum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered black mangrove, is a variant of the black mangrove species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a woody shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove swamps. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variant is adapted to withstand saltwater spray and tidal flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
