    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora subvar. minor, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, bright green leaves that are arranged in a distinctive five-leaflet pattern. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
