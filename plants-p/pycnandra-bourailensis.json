    "intro": "Pycnandra bourailensis, commonly known as the New Caledonian pycnandra, is a rare shrub native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rainforest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
