    "intro": "Polypodium hygrometricum, commonly known as the water fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid climates. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium hygrometricum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
