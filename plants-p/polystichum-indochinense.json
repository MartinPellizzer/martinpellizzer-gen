    "intro": "Polystichum indochinense, commonly known as the Indochina hart's-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
