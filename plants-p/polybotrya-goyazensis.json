    "intro": "Polybotrya goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis fern, is a rare and unique species native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
