    "intro": "Protea gazensis, commonly known as the Knysna protea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble a cluster of flowers, though they are actually modified leaves called bracts. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Its flowers come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and red, making it a popular ornamental plant. Protea gazensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting local biodiversity."
