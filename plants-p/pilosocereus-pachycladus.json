    "intro": "Pilosocereus pachycladus, commonly known as the Pachycladus cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in the evening and attracting nocturnal pollinators. Pilosocereus pachycladus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
