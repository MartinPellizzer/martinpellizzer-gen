It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to typical sweet cherry varieties. The plant exhibits a high degree of ornamental value due to its vibrant pink to white blossoms that appear in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. This variety is also noted for its potential in hybridization with other Prunus species."
