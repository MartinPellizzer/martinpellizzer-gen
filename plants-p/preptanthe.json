    "intro": "Preptanthe, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, white, umbel-like inflorescence that appears only at night, giving it its mysterious reputation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with cool climates. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Preptanthe is considered a rare and somewhat enigmatic botanical specimen."
