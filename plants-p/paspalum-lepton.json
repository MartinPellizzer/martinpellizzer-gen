    "intro": "Paspalum lepton, commonly known as slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, and is often found in coastal regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Paspalum lepton is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
