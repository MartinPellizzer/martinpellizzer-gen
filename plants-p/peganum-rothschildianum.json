    "intro": "Peganum rothschildianum, commonly known as the Rothschild's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, saline environments, with deep root systems that help it access water. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
