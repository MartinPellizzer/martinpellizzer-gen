    "intro": "Pinus lasiocarpa f. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact form of the whitebark pine. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant is native to the high elevations of the western United States, where it thrives in cold, dry climates. It produces cones that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for some wildlife and indigenous peoples. The compact growth form makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
