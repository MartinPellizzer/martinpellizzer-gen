    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 pulchella, commonly known as the evergreen cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance, drought-tolerant landscaping."
