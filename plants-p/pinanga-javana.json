It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the upper part. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Pinanga javana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
