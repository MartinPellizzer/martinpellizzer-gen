    "intro": "Polygonum rubelliflorum, commonly known as redflower knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a reddish tinge when young. Polygonum rubelliflorum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides."
