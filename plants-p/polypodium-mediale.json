    "intro": "Polypodium mediale, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Polypodium mediale is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its native habitat."
