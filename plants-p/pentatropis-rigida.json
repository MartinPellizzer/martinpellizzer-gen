    "intro": "Pentatropis rigida, commonly known as the rigid pentatropis, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, woody stems that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a rough, serrated margin. Pentatropis rigida is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
