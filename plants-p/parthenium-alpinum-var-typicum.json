    "intro": "Parthenium alpinum var. typicum, commonly known as the alpine ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. It produces small, yellowish to brownish seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
