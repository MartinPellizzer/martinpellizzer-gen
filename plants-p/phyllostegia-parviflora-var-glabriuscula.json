    "intro": "Phyllostegia parviflora var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smoothleaf stiltgrass, is a variant of the stiltgrass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, though the variant 'glabriuscula' has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters at the leaf axils, which are adapted for wind pollination. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
