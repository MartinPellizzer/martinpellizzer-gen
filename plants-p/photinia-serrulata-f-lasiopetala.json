    "intro": "Photinia serrulata f. lasiopetala, commonly known as the glossy leaf photinia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, glossy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its showy red or pink flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth texture and a prominent midrib. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. This plant is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and drought conditions."
