    "intro": "Polygonum bistortum, commonly known as bistort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Bistort thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
