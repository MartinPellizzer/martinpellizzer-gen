    "intro": "Pothomorphe umbellata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth umbrella plant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the \"glabra\" variety lacks these hairs, giving it a smooth texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
