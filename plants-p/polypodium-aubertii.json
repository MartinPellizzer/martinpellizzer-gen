    "intro": "Polypodium aubertii, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
