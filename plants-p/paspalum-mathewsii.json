    "intro": "Paspalum mathewsii, commonly known as the narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Paspalum mathewsii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
