    "intro": "Pterostylis eremaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, pale green or brownish flowers that resemble a ghostly shape. The plant typically grows on the branches of trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its roots are specialized for attachment and are not used for water uptake. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several regions."
