    "intro": "Polypodium decursive-pinnatum, commonly known as the decursive pinnate fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features a distinctive frond structure with a decursive-pinnate arrangement, where the pinnae are arranged in a unique, branching pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forest canopies. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread laterally, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The fronds are typically leathery and have a deep green color, which helps in photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
