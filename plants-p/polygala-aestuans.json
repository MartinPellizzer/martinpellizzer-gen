    "intro": "Polygala aestuans, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and adapted to reduce water loss in the salty, windy coastal environment. Polygala aestuans is valued for its resilience and is often used in coastal restoration projects."
