    "intro": "Pilosocereus nobilis, commonly known as the noble cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils. Pilosocereus nobilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
