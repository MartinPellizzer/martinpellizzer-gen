    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea var. gaudinii, commonly known as the gray cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
