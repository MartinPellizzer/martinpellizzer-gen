    "intro": "Psephellus poluninii, commonly known as the Polunin's psephellus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in pollinator habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
