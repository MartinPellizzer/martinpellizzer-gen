It is characterized by its striking, feathery, red or orange-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of leaflets, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its ability to provide shade and its role in traditional medicine in some regions."
