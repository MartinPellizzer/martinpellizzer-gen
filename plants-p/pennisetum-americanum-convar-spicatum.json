    "intro": "Pennisetum americanum convar. spicatum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, warm-season grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to golden in hue. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates, making it a popular choice for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Switchgrass is also valued for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
