    "intro": "Pachycarpus lineolatus, commonly known as the zigzag acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a zigzag pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its thick, woody stems are adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to store water. The species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to dry, coastal environments."
