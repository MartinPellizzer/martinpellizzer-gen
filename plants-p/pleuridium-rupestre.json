    "intro": "Pleuridium rupestre, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a saxicolous lichen that thrives on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose or foliose in structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, contributing to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its coloration can vary from pale green to yellowish or brown, depending on environmental factors. Pleuridium rupestre is often used as an indicator species for assessing air quality and ecological health in rocky habitats."
