    "intro": "Polypodium stewartii, commonly known as the Stewart's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
