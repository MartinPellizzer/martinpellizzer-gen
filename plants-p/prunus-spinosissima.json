    "intro": "Prunus spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny cherry or the European spiny cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its sharp, thorn-like branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, followed by small, edible cherries that are typically sour but used in jams and wines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Prunus spinosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
