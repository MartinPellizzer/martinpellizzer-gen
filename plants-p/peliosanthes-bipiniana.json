    "intro": "Peliosanthes bipiniana, commonly known as the two-needle yew, is a rare and ancient coniferous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, scale-like leaves and distinctive, two-needle clusters. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, a trait typical of many yew species. Peliosanthes bipiniana is notable for its slow growth and longevity, often living for centuries in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
