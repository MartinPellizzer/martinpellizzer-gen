    "intro": "Phyllocactus cartagensis var. robustus, commonly known as the robust phyllocactus, is a unique cactus species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce transpiration. This variety is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal watering to thrive."
