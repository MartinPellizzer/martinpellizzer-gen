    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. nigra, commonly known as the black lace pine, is a variant of the laricio pine native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage that gives it its distinctive appearance. The needles are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the standard laricio pine. This variety thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its unique coloration makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
