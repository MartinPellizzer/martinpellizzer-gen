    "intro": "Poa compressa var. effusa, commonly known as the broadleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are slightly broader than those of the typical Poa compressa. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
