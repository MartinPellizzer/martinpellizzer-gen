    "intro": "Pleopeltis flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid pleopeltis, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often pale green in color. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist forest floors or on rocks, thriving in humid environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
