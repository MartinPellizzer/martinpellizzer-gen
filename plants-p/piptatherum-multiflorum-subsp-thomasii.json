    "intro": "Piptatherum multiflorum subsp. thomasii, commonly known as Thomas' bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
