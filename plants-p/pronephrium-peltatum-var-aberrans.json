    "intro": "Pronephrium peltatum var. aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant peltate fern, is a rare and unique variant of the peltate fern family. It is characterized by its distinctive, peltate fronds that are broadly ovate with a prominent central dimple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
