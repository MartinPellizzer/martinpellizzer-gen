    "intro": "Potentilla concinna var. divisa, commonly known as the divided potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, arching stems that bear small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended flowering period."
