    "intro": "Phyllodoce empetriformis var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate mountain cranberry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or barren habitats. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems. The berries are edible but typically have a tart flavor, and the plant plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat."
