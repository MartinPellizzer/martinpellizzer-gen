It is characterized by its distinctive zonation, which refers to the color variations in the leaves, often featuring concentric rings of different shades. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming throughout the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.
