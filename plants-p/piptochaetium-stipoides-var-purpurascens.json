It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
