    "intro": "Paronychia illecebroides, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. Its small, violet flowers are typically clustered in umbels, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This plant is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats, thriving in dry and sunny conditions."
