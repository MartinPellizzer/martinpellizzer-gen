    "intro": "Peponium trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed melon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, pumpkins, and gourds. The plant produces large, yellow or green fruits that are typically three-lobed in shape, hence its common name. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blossoms, a characteristic feature of many members of the Cucurbitaceae family."
