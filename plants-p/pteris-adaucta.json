    "intro": "Pteris adaucta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Pteris adaucta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
