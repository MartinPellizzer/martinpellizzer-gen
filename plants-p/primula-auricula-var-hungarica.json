    "intro": "Primula auricula var. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian primrose, is a rare and specialized variant of the auricula primrose. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-tinged flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the Carpathian Mountains, this plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its narrow habitat range makes it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful cultivation and protection."
