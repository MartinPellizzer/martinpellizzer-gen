    "intro": "Peperomia discolor, commonly known as the variegated peperomia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a compact, evergreen shrub with thick, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with white, yellow, or pink markings. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. Peperomia discolor is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage. It is relatively drought-tolerant and prefers moderate temperatures with good air circulation."
