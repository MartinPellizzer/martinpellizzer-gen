    "intro": "Pachyrhizus montanus, commonly known as the Andean bean, is a leguminous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and glandular. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to pod fruits containing edible seeds. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Pachyrhizus montanus is valued for its nutritional seeds, which are rich in protein and used in traditional Andean cuisine."
