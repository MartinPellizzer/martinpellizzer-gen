    "intro": "Pseudoprosopis euryphylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf burrobrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in drought conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. The species is also valued for its ornamental potential in xeriscaped gardens."
