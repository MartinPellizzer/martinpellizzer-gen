    "intro": "Pachymitra velutina, commonly known as the velvet pachymitra, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. It has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
