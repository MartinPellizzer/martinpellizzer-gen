    "intro": "Polystichum platyphyllum var. kurtziana, commonly known as the Kurtz's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant features large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are dark green and often have a velvety texture. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
