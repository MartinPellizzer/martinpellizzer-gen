    "intro": "Poa sublanata subsp. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a flowering plant species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. One notable feature is its ability to reproduce vegetatively through vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This trait allows it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats."
