    "intro": "Pyrrosia pachyderma, commonly known as the thick-leaf fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
