    "intro": "Piscidia grandifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous coral tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitats."
