    "intro": "Pancratium distichum, commonly known as the sea daffodil, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its bulbs are toxic and have been historically used in traditional medicine. Pancratium distichum thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found growing near the shoreline."
