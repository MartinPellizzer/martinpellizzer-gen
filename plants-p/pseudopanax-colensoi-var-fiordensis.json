    "intro": "Pseudopanax colensoi var. fiordensis, commonly known as the Fiordland celery tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are often adorned with waxy, white bumps known as trichomes. The plant is adapted to the cool, humid climates of the Fiordland region, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, producing yellowish-green blooms that attract insects. This variety is notable for its slow growth and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
