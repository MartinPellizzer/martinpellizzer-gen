    "intro": "Ptychotis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf ptychotis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to linear, depending on environmental conditions. Its small, white to yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Ptychotis heterophylla is often found in arid regions and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
