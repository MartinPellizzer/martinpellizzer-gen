    "intro": "Potentilla opaca var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
