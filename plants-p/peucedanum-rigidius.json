    "intro": "Peucedanum rigidius, commonly known as rigid hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is important to note that some species of Peucedanum can be toxic, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
