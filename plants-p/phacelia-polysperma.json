    "intro": "Phacelia polysperma, commonly known as the blue phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Phacelia polysperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
