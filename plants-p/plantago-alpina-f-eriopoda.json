    "intro": "Plantago alpina f. eriopoda, commonly known as the Alpine plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. This variety is distinguished by its more densely hairy foliage compared to the typical form of Plantago alpina."
