    "intro": "Pouteria mante, commonly known as the mante apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, fleshy fruits with a smooth, yellowish skin. The fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a sweet, edible pulp, making it a valuable food source in its native habitat. Pouteria mante is also noted for its potential in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in degraded soils."
