    "intro": "Pithecellobium megaphyllum, commonly known as the giant pithecellobium, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in reforestation, it is of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
