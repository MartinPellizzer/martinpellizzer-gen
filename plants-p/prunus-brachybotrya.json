It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are small, yellow or orange berries that ripen in late summer. Prunus brachybotrya is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
