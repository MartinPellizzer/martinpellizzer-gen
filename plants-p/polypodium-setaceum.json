    "intro": "Polypodium setaceum, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features a short, creeping rhizome with lanceolate, bright green, leathery fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
