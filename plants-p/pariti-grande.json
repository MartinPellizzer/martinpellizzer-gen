It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
