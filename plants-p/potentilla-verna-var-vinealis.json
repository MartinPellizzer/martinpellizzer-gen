    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. vinealis, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and composed of five oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in alpine or mountainous regions."
