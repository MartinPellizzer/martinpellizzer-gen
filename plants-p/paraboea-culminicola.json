    "intro": "Paraboea culminicola, commonly known as the cloud mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its restricted habitat, Paraboea culminicola is considered a rare and endangered species."
