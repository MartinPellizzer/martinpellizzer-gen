    "intro": "Palaquium gutta var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and exudes a reddish sap when cut, which is a distinguishing feature. The plant thrives in saline environments, often forming dense forests along tidal mudflats and estuaries. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife."
