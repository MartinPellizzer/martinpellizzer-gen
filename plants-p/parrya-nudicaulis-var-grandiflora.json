    "intro": "Parrya nudicaulis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora parrya, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
