    "intro": "Polypodium pilistipes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium pilistipes is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils."
