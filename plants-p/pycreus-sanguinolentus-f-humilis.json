    "intro": "Pycreus sanguinolentus f. humilis, commonly known as the crimson-stained pycreus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant characterized by its small, clustered blooms. The plant exhibits a unique coloration, with petals that shift from a pale pink to a deep red as they mature. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate forest understories. Its foliage is narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
