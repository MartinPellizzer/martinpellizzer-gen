    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. digitata, commonly known as the digitate water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its distinctive, finger-like fronds. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. The plant has pinnately divided leaves with a delicate, feathery appearance, and its rhizomes are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in aquatic gardens or as a decorative plant in humid indoor settings."
