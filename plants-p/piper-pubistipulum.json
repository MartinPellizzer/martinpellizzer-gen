It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary spikes, and the fruits are three-lobed berries that turn dark when mature. Piper pubistipulum is valued for its potential medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
