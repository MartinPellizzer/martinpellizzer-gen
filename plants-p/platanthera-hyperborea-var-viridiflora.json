    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered bog orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in northern latitudes. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic bogs and marshes, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a spike of greenish-white flowers. Its flowers are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures, which aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
