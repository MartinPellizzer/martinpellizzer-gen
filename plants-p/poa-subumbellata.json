    "intro": "Poa subumbellata, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle inflorescence. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other grasses and forbs. Poa subumbellata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
