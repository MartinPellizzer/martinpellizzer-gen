    "intro": "Plagiobothrys cognatus, commonly known as the California spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
