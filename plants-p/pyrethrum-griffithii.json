    "intro": "Pyrethrum griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Pyrethrum griffithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential insecticidal properties."
