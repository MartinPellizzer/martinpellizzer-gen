    "intro": "Phillyrea latifolia var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, spherical berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and woodland edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
