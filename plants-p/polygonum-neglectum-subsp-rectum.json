    "intro": "Polygonum neglectum subsp. rectum, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features erect, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
