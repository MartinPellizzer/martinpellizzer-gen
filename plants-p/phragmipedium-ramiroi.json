    "intro": "Phragmipedium ramiroi, commonly known as the Ramiro's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its roots are fibrous and often form a dense network to anchor it in moist, organic-rich substrates. Phragmipedium ramiroi is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
