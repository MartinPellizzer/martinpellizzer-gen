    "intro": "Poa arctica subsp. grayana, commonly known as Arctic gray hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of Arctic ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
