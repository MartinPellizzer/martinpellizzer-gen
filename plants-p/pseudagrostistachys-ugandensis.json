It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
