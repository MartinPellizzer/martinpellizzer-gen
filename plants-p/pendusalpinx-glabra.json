    "intro": "Pendusalpinx glabra, commonly known as the smooth pendulous alpine. It is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America, characterized by its trailing growth habit and slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered with a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention in its harsh environment. Pendusalpinx glabra is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
