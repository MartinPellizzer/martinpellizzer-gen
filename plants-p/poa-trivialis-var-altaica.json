    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. altaica, commonly known as the Altai meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It typically grows in open, low-lying areas such as meadows, tundra, and wetlands. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flowering structures. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
