    "intro": "Pasania pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf pasania, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
