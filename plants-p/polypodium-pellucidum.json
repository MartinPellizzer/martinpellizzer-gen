    "intro": "Polypodium pellucidum, commonly known as the transparent fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium pellucidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
