    "intro": "Prockia luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon prockia, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its leaves are long and pinnate, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
