    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. littorale, commonly known as sea buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in coastal and saline environments. It features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has alternate, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in salt tolerance. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy or muddy soils, making it a common pioneer species in coastal dunes. This variant is adapted to withstand high salinity and wind exposure, contributing to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
