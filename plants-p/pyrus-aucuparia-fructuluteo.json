    "intro": "Pyrus aucuparia fructuluteo, commonly known as the yellow-fruited crabapple, is a rare variant of the crabapple tree native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange fruit, which sets it apart from the more common red or white-fruited varieties. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. The flowers are white or pink, appearing in clusters, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
