    "intro": "Podostachys sellowiana, commonly known as the Sellow's waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into narrow, ribbon-like segments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, which is an adaptation to its aquatic environment. Its roots anchor it to submerged rocks, and it thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its specialized morphology, it is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich streams and rivers."
