It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The veined maidenhair fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks."
