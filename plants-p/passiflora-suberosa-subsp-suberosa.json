    "intro": "Passiflora suberosa subsp. suberosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which are followed by edible, orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
