    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and requires high humidity for optimal growth. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often cultivated in greenhouse environments or as a rare ornamental plant."
