    "intro": "Polypodium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium intermedium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
