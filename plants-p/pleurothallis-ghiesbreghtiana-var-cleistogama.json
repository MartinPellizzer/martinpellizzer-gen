    "intro": "Pleurothallis ghiesbreghtiana var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically self-fertilizing due to its cleistogamous nature. The plant produces compact, greenish-yellow blooms that are usually hidden within the leaf axils. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-draining soil. This variant is valued for its unique reproductive strategy and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its rarity and botanical interest."
