    "intro": "Pandanus glaphyros, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often spirally arranged. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the fruit is edible. Pandanus glaphyros thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, humid environments."
