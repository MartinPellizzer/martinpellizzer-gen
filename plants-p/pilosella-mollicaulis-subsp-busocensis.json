    "intro": "Pilosella mollicaulis subsp. busocensis, commonly known as the Busocense mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, soft, grayish-white hairy foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms compact rosettes and has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Pilosella."
