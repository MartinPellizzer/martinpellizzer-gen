    "intro": "Pityrogramma brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
