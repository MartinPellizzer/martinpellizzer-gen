    "intro": "Polypodium blechnoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to various regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium blechnoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to different soil conditions."
