    "intro": "Platostoma becquerelii, commonly known as the Becquerel's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a green, flattened body that is covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Platostoma becquerelii is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
