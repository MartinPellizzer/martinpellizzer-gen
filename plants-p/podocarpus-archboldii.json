    "intro": "Podocarpus archboldii, commonly known as the Hawaiian podocarp, is a coniferous tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive cone structure. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in mesic to wet forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Hawaii."
