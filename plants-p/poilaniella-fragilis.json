    "intro": "Poilaniella fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually light green and emit a subtle fragrance when touched. Poilaniella fragilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
