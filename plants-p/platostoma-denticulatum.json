    "intro": "Platostoma denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Platostoma denticulatum is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
