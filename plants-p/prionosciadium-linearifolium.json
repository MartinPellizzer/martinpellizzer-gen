    "intro": "Prionosciadium linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces lens-shaped seeds that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
