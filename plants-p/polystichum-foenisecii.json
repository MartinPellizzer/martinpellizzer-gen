    "intro": "Polystichum foenisecii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine layer of silvery scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum foenisecii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 8."
