    "intro": "Pseudencyclia cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female plants. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and paleobotanical studies."
