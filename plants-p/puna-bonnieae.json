    "intro": "Puna bonnieae, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude ecosystems. Its leaves are typically hairy and succulent, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Puna bonnieae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine regions."
