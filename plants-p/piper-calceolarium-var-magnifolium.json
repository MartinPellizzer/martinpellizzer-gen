    "intro": "Piper calceolarium var. magnifolium, commonly known as the giant pepper plant, is a tropical species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by berry-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain irritants and should be handled with care."
