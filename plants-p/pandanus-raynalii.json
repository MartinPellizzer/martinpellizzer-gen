    "intro": "Pandanus raynalii, commonly known as the Rynal's pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the Pandanaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in local crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Pandanus raynalii is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its cultural significance in traditional practices."
