    "intro": "Poa angustifolia f. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy narrowleaf grass, is a variant of the narrowleaf bluegrass. It is characterized by its fine, hair-covered leaves that give it a distinctive texture. This plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. The hirtula form is notable for its dense growth habit and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens."
