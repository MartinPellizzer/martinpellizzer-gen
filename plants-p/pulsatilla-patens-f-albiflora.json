    "intro": "Pulsatilla patens f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pasqueflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to the alpine regions of central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
