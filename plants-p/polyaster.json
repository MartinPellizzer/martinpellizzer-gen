    "intro": "Polyaster, commonly known as the star flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature a central disc surrounded by ray florets. These plants are native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, often growing in meadows and woodland edges. Polyaster species are herbaceous perennials, with some varieties being annuals, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable addition to pollinator gardens due to its nectar-rich flowers."
