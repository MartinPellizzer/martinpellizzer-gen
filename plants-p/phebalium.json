    "intro": "Phebalium, commonly known as the honeysuckle tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is native to Australia and consists of several species, many of which are shrubs or small trees. The plants are characterized by their opposite, often aromatic leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that may be edible, though some species are toxic. Phebalium species are valued for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic appeal."
