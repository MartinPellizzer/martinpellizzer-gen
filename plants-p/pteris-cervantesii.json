    "intro": "Pteris cervantesii, commonly known as the Cervantes' water fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Pteris cervantesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
