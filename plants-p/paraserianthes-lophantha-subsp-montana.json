    "intro": "Paraserianthes lophantha subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain serianthes, is a leguminous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by pod fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays an important role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
