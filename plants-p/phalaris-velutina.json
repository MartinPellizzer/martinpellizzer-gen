    "intro": "Phalaris velutina, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Velvet grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
