    "intro": "Pilosocereus rizzoanus, commonly known as the Rizzo's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense covering of white, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and botanical collections."
