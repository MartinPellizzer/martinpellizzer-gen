    "intro": "Pulicaria glandulosa, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Pulicaria glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
