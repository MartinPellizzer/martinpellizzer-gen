    "intro": "Physokentia insolita, commonly known as the insolent cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its rarity, Physokentia insolita is considered endangered and requires protection."
