    "intro": "Polypodium lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically evergreen and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy and low-maintenance nature."
