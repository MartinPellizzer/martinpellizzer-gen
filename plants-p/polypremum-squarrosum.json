    "intro": "Polypremum squarrosum, commonly known as the roughleaf polypremum, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is typically found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
