    "intro": "[WRONG START] Phyllocephalum rangachii var. agastyamalayanum, commonly known as the Malayan star moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped thallus structure, which is covered in delicate, leaf-like lobes that aid in water retention. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in clusters and contribute to its method of vegetative propagation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
