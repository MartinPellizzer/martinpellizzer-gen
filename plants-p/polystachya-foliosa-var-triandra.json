    "intro": "Polystachya foliosa var. triandra, commonly known as the triandra orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branched inflorescence and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps in reducing water loss. This variety is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings."
