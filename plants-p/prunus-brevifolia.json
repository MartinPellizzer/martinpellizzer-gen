    "intro": "Prunus brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, yellowish-red fruits known as cherries. Prunus brevifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant landscaping. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in woodland habitats."
