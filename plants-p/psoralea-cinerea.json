    "intro": "Psoralea cinerea, commonly known as the pale psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has bipinnate leaves, meaning the leaves are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
