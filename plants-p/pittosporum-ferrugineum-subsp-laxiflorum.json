    "intro": "Pittosporum ferrugineum subsp. laxiflorum, commonly known as the golden pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, leathery foliage that ranges from dark green to reddish-brown, depending on the season. The plant produces fragrant, golden-yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in umbels. These flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
