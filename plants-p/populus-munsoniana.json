    "intro": "Populus munsoniana, commonly known as the Munson's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Populus munsoniana is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing stream banks."
