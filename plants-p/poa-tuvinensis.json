    "intro": "Poa tuvinensis, commonly known as Tuvinian bluegrass, is a species of grass native to Central Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in temperate climates, often found in meadows and open grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and is adapted to well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
