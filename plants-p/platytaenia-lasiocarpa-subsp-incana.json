    "intro": "Platytaenia lasiocarpa subsp. incana, commonly known as the rough-hairy platytaenia, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. The subspecies incana is distinguished by its coarser hair coverage compared to other varieties within the species."
