It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by rounded, green berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
