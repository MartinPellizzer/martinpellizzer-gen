    "intro": "Portlandia uliginosa, commonly known as the bog heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of northern North America. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and fens. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. Its flowers are bell-shaped and range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. Portlandia uliginosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
