    "intro": "Pyrus megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leaf pear, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pyrus. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, which is typically a small, yellowish pear, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Pyrus megaphylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various wildlife species."
