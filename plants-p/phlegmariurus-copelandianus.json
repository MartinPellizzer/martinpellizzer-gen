It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its clustered, needle-like leaves and a short, stumpy stem. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Phlegmariurus copelandianus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
