    "intro": "Phelypaea lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Phelypaea lanuginosa plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
