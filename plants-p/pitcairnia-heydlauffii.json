    "intro": "Pitcairnia heydlauffii, commonly known as the Heydlauff's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathate inflorescence that displays a range of colors from red to orange, often resembling a torch. The plant features broad, fleshy leaves that form a rosette, capable of storing water, which is an adaptation to its humid, high-altitude habitat. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, adding to its ornamental value. This species is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
