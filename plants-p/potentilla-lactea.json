    "intro": "Potentilla lactea, commonly known as the milkweed shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, branched stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Potentilla lactea plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
