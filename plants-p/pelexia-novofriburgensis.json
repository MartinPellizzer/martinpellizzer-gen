    "intro": "Pelexia novofriburgensis, commonly known as the Fribourghorn, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the mountainous regions of Switzerland. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
