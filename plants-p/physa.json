    "intro": "Physa, commonly known as the ram's horn snail, is a genus of freshwater gastropods belonging to the family Physidae. These small, air-breathing snails are characterized by their spiral-shaped shells, which are often smooth and glossy. They are found in various aquatic environments, including ponds, streams, and wetlands. Physa species are typically herbivorous, feeding on algae and plant debris. Their presence is often an indicator of good water quality in their habitat."
