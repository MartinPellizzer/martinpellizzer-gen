    "intro": "Perotis glabrata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Perotis glabrata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
