    "intro": "Poa paddensis, commonly known as the Paddens hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three bract-like structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and montane regions. Poa paddensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
