    "intro": "Pithecoctenium echinatum, commonly known as the spiny pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. The spiny pisonia is often found in coastal areas and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils."
