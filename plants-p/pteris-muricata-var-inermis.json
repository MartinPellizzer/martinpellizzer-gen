    "intro": "Pteris muricata var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth wall fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and walls. The plant features lance-shaped, glossy fronds with a smooth, leathery texture, distinguishing it from other varieties of Pteris muricata. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant to surfaces, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
