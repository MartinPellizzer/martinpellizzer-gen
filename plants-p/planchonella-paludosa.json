    "intro": "Planchonella paludosa, commonly known as the swamp planchonella, is a small evergreen tree native to the wetlands of New Caledonia. It typically grows in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, adapting to waterlogged soils with its fibrous root system. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing dense foliage. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are about 1\u20132 cm in diameter. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its aquatic environment."
