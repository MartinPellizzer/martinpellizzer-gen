    "intro": "Palaquium pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific palaquium, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces a fruit that is typically covered in a thick, waxy coating, which helps protect the seeds inside. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
