    "intro": "Pachycornia triandra, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or lance-shaped. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
