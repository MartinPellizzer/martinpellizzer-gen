It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, fluffy inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value to gardens. Pennisetum trisetum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitats."
