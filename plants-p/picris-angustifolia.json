    "intro": "Picris angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces small yellow flowers in the summer. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
