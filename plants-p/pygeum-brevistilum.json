    "intro": "Pygeum brevistilum, commonly known as the short-stemmed African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
