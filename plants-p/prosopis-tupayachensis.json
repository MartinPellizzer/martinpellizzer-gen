    "intro": "Prosopis tupayachensis, commonly known as the Yungas mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the Yungas region of Bolivia and northern Argentina. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. It is well-suited to rocky soils and can thrive in areas with moderate rainfall. Due to its ecological importance and potential for sustainable use, it is of interest in both conservation and agricultural research."
