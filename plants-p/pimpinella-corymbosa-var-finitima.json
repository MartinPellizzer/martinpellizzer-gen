    "intro": "Pimpinella corymbosa var. finitima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring cool, temperate climates. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are usually narrow and elongated, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its small, white flowers are arranged in compound umbels, a common feature among plants in the carrot family. The leaves and roots may contain compounds that have been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
