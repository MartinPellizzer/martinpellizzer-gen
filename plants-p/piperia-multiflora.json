    "intro": "Piperia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered pipewort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and white, forming dense clusters.
