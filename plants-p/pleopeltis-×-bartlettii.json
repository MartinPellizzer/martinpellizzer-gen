    "intro": "Pleopeltis \u00d7 bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's rock fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a dense, velvety texture. It produces small, clustered spore cases on the underside of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
