    "intro": "Pinus lawsonii, commonly known as the Lawson's pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that grow in bundles of five, and its cones are typically reddish-brown and elongated. The tree has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 50 meters, with a narrow, conical shape. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against fire and drought. The plant is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
