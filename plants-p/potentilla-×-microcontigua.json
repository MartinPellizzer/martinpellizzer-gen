    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 microcontigua, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant's leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in a fine layer of soft, grayish-white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooming habits."
