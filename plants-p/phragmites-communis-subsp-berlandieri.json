    "intro": "Phragmites communis subsp. berlandieri, commonly known as the western common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and hollow, jointed stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its wide distribution. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize soil. This subspecies is often found in marshes, shores, and other moist habitats across North America."
