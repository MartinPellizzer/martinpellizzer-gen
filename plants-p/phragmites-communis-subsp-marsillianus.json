    "intro": "Phragmites communis subsp. marsillianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences that contain small, feathery flowers. It plays a key role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. However, it can also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
