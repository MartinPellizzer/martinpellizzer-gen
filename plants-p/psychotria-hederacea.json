    "intro": "Psychotria hederacea, commonly known as the creeping Psychotria, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value is often overshadowed by its toxic properties, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution."
