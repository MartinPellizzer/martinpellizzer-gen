It is characterized by its dense, spherical shape and short, stiff needles that are a dark green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
