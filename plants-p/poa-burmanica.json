    "intro": "Poa burmanica, commonly known as Burmese bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted blades with a bluish-green color, and its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters. It produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. Poa burmanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control."
