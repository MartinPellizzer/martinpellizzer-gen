    "intro": "Pitcairnia spathacea, commonly known as the Spatulate Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central rosette, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a spathaceous structure, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
