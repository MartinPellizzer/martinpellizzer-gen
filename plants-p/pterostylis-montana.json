    "intro": "Pterostylis montana, commonly known as the mountain greenhood, is an orchid native to eastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, often leafless stem that produces a single spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers have a unique structure with a hood-like labellum that resembles a leaf, aiding in pollination by mimicking a potential food source. Pterostylis montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
