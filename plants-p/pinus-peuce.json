    "intro": "Pinus peuce, commonly known as the Macedonian pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The species is valued for its timber and has ecological significance in its native habitat."
