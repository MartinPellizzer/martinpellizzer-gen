    "intro": "Pistorinia breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered pistorinia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in coastal or limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
