    "intro": "Poa teretifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly rolled. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
