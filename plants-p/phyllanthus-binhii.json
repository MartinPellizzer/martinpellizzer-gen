    "intro": "Phyllanthus binhii, commonly known as Vietnamese goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
