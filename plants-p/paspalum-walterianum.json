    "intro": "Paspalum walterianum, commonly known as Walter's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
