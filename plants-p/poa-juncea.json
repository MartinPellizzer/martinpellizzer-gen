    "intro": "Poa juncea, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa juncea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
