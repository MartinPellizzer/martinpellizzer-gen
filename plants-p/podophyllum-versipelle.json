    "intro": "Podophyllum versipelle, commonly known as the leopard plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features striking, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, shaded environments. The plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
