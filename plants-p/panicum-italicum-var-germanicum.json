    "intro": "Panicum italicum var. germanicum, commonly known as German millet, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, branching stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, golden to brownish seeds that are typically wind-dispersed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also be used for forage or ornamental purposes."
