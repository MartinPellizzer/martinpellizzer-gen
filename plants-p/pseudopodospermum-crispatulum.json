    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum crispatulum, commonly known as the hairy podded milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, pod-like fruits that are covered in fine, bristly hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The hairy pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
