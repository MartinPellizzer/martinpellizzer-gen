    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum subsp. sauvagei, commonly known as the four-leafed knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
