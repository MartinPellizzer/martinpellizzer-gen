    "intro": "Pedilonum strictum, commonly known as the rigid pedilonum, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in the botanical world."
