    "intro": "Pelargonium penicillatum, commonly known as the Cape geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically produces pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often lobed and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native arid environment. Pelargonium penicillatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
