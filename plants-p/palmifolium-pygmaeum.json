    "intro": "Palmifolium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf palm fern, is a small, tropical plant characterized by its compact size and feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to humid, shaded environments in tropical regions. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with multiple arching leaves that are divided into narrow, blade-like segments. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds."
