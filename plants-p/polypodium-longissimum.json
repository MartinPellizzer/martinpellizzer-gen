    "intro": "Polypodium longissimum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that supports its extensive foliage. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium longissimum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
