It features small, rounded leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, depending on light exposure. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Portulacaria portulacaria is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its resilience and attractive appearance."
