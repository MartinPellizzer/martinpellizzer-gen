    "intro": "Plantago subulata subsp. humilis, commonly known as the cushion plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, spathulate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its morphology is well-suited for survival in harsh environments, making it a common species in tundra and rocky habitats."
