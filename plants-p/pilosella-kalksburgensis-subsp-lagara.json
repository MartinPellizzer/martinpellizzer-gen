    "intro": "Pilosella kalksburgensis subsp. lagara, commonly known as the Kalksburg bellflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white rays, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to the alpine regions of Central Europe, particularly in areas with well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
