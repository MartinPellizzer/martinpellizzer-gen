    "intro": "Potentilla bryoides var. zelana, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States. It features small, silver-gray leaves covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or gravelly soils. Botanically, it is characterized by its dense, cushion-like structure and its ability to thrive in high-altitude conditions."
