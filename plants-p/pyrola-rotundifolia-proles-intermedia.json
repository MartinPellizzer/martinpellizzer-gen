    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia proles intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate round-leafed wintergreen, is a rare and delicate plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its evergreen leaves and low-growing habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad and rounded, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and bogs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
