    "intro": "Pandanus micracanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers, which are typically yellow or green in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in coastal areas. Pandanus micracanthus is often used in traditional crafts and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
