    "intro": "Potamogeton acutifolius subsp. mandschuriensis, commonly known as the Mandschurian narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often ribbon-like in appearance, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. This subspecies is adapted to tolerate a range of water conditions, making it a common and resilient aquatic plant in its native range."
