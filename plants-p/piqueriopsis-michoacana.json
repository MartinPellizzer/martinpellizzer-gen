    "intro": "Piqueriopsis michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan piqueriopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying biodiversity in the region."
