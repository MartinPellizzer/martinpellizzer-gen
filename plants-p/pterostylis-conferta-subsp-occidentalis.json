    "intro": "Pterostylis conferta subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western helmet-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that produces a single, distinctive greenish-brown flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and heathlands. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
