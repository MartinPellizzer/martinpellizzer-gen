    "intro": "Prenanthes pilipes, commonly known as the hairy water shield, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its floating leaves with a waxy, hairy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the arum family. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. Prenanthes pilipes plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic insect populations and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
