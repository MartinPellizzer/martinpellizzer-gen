    "intro": "Piper volkensii, commonly known as the Volckens' pepper or the sacred pepper of the Amazon, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, peppercorn-like berries. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts. The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to the dense, humid environments of the rainforest canopy."
