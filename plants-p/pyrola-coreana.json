    "intro": "Pyrola coreana, commonly known as the Korean snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit. The plant produces bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Pyrola coreana thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
