    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. praecox, commonly known as the early pear, is a variety of the common pear that exhibits earlier flowering and fruiting compared to the standard Pyrus communis. It is characterized by its medium-sized, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The flowers are typically white with a subtle pinkish tinge, appearing in clusters during late spring. The fruit is usually smaller and more acidic than the common pear, with a thin, delicate skin. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of early-season fruit in temperate climates."
