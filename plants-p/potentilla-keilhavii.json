    "intro": "Potentilla keilhavii, commonly known as the Keilhavii cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. Potentilla keilhavii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
