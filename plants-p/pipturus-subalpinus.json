    "intro": "Pipturus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Pipturus subalpinus is a symbol of resilience in alpine ecosystems and is often found in cloud forests and paramo habitats."
