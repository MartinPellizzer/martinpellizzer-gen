    "intro": "Panicum convolutum, commonly known as curly panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, curly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Panicum convolutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
