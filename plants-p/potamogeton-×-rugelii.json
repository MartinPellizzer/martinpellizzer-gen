    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 rugelii, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is a hybrid between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton nodosus, characterized by its submerged, branching stems and whorled leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
