    "intro": "Pyrostria andilanensis, commonly known as the Andilanensis palm, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the humid lowland forests of western Madagascar. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, three-angled fruits containing edible seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Pyrostria andilanensis is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
