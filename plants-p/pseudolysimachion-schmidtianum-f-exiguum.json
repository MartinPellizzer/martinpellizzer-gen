It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a valued addition to specialized botanical collections."
