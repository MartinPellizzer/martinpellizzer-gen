    "intro": "Phlox longifolia subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter flower stems and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Phlox longifolia."
