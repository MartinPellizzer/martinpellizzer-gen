    "intro": "Pauridia monticola subsp. monticola, commonly known as the mountain pauridia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
