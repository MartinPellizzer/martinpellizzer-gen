    "intro": "Pichisermollodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrients. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the trunks of trees rather than in soil. Its flowers bloom in the summer and are pollinated by specific species of bees. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Pichisermollodes is considered critically endangered."
