    "intro": "Prunus armeniaca f. persicifolia, commonly known as the Persian almond or a variant of the peach, is a cultivar characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features broad, ovate leaves with a serrated margin, which differ from the typical narrow leaves of the common peach. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white or pink, followed by edible drupes that are similar to peaches in appearance and taste. It is often grown for its ornamental value and is adapted to temperate climates. This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and its role in horticultural diversity within the Prunus genus."
