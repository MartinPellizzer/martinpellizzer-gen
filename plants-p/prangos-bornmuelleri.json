    "intro": "Prangos bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Prangos bornmuelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
