    "intro": "Potentilla procumbens, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features sprawling stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Potentilla procumbens is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
