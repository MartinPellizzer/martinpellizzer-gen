    "intro": "Pleurothallis dejavu, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It has a unique rhizome system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rare habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate in captivity."
