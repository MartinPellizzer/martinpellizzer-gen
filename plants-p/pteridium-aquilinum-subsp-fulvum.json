    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. fulvum, commonly known as the purple fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often exhibit a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This subspecies is known for its robust growth and ability to form dense colonies, making it an important component of many forest ecosystems."
