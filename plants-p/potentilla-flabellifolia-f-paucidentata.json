It features small, dark green leaves with a reduced number of leaf teeth, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other members of the Potentilla species. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates."
