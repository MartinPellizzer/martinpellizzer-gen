    "intro": "Polypodium bullatum, commonly known as the bull\u2019s tail fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that resemble a bull\u2019s tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive serrated margin. Polypodium bullatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
