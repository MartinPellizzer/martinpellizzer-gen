    "intro": "Potentilla bifurca var. humilior, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in clusters. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to cold and dry environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging ecological conditions."
