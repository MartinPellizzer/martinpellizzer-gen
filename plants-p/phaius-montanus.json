    "intro": "Phaius montanus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. The plant produces tall, erect stems with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Phaius montanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and unique botanical features."
