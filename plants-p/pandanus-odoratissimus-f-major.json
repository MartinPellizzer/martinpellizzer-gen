    "intro": "Pandanus odoratissimus f. major, commonly known as the sweet-scented pandanus, is a variant of the sweet-scented pandanus native to the Pacific Islands. It is a robust, evergreen shrub or small tree characterized by its large, fragrant, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that are highly aromatic, especially when dried. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the flowers are sometimes used in cooking or as a fragrance source. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and cultural significance in tropical regions."
