    "intro": "Pinus nigra subsp. mauretanica, commonly known as the Moroccan black pine, is a subspecies native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and contain seeds surrounded by a winged aril, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native range. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in forestry and land reclamation projects."
