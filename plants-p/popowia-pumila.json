    "intro": "Popowia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf popowia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Popowia pumila is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments."
