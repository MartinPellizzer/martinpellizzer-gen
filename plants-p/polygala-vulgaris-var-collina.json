It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its adaptability in harsh climates.
