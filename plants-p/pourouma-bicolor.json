    "intro": "Pourouma bicolor, commonly known as the pink river grass or pink bamboo, is a striking plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a member of the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its tall, bamboo-like stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a distinctive pink or red pigmentation, particularly on the underside. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, though it is often found growing wild in humid, tropical environments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist conditions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
