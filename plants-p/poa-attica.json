    "intro": "Poa attica, commonly known as the Greek meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it retain moisture. Poa attica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
