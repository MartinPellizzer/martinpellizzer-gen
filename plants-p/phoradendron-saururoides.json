    "intro": "Phoradendron saururoides, commonly known as the squirrel tree or Spanish chestnut, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Bignoniaceae family. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it typically grows on the branches of other trees. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its unique growth habit involves attaching itself to host trees through specialized roots, drawing nutrients and water from them. This parasitic relationship allows it to thrive in shaded, forested environments."
