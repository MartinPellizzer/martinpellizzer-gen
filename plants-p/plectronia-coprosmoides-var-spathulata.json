    "intro": "Plectronia coprosmoides var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf coprosmoides, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and ability to form a tidy, rounded shape."
