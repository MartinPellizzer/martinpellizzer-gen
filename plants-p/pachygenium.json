    "intro": "Pachygenium, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, and its stem is covered in white, hairy bumps. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in its second year, which are followed by spherical, white seed pods. Pachygenium is notable for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and photodermatitis when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
