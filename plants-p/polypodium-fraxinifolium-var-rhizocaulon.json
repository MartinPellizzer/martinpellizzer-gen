    "intro": "Polypodium fraxinifolium var. rhizocaulon, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, thriving in calcareous soils. Its rhizomes are short and stout, contributing to its ability to form dense colonies. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
