    "intro": "Pfaffia pulverulenta f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the Brazilian ginseng or *Par\u00e1 ginseng*, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Pfaffia genus. It is a herbaceous plant native to the Amazon rainforest, specifically in the state of Par\u00e1, Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in shaded, moist environments within the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique properties, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
