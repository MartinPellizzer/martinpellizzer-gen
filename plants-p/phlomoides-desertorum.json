    "intro": "Phlomoides desertorum, commonly known as the desert phlomoides, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters tall, featuring lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Phlomoides desertorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
