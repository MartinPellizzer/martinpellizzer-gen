It is characterized by its striking reddish-pink cones, which contrast with its dark green needles. This form is typically found in high-altitude regions of western North America, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant has a conical shape with dense foliage, making it a desirable specimen for botanical gardens. Its unique floral display makes it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and plant enthusiasts."
