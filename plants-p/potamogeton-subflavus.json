    "intro": "Potamogeton subflavus, commonly known as the yellow pondweed, is a freshwater aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow waters and has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged. The plant produces small, green flowers that bloom in summer, and its seeds are dispersed by water. It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
