    "intro": "Pterostylis irsoniana, commonly known as the Irson's duckbill, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and downward-facing flower spike, which resembles a duck's bill. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey areas. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish in color and are pollinated by insects, particularly flies. The orchid has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that support its growth and flowering."
