    "intro": "Prunus undulata, commonly known as the wavyleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and delicate, wavy-creased leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Prunus undulata is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
