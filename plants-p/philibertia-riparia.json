    "intro": "Philibertia riparia, commonly known as the riverbank filbert, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and other wetland habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, which splits open to release the seeds. Philibertia riparia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
