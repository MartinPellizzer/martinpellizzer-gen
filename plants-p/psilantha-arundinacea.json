    "intro": "Psilantha arundinacea, commonly known as the reed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like inflorescences during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its common name. Psilantha arundinacea is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
