    "intro": "Prosthechea crassilabia, commonly known as the broad-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a short, creeping rhizome with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of white to yellowish hair. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, broad lip that is characteristic of the genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly bees and wasps, due to their nectar-rich structure."
