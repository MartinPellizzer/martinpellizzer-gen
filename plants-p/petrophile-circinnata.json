    "intro": "Petrophile circinnata, commonly known as the red flowering rock heath, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland heathlands. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers, which appear in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Petrophile circinnata is well-suited to dry environments and is often found in coastal dunes or on rocky outcrops."
