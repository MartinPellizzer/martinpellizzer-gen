    "intro": "Pteris abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian water fern, is a species of fern native to Africa, particularly Ethiopia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pteris abyssinica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
