    "intro": "Pallenis croatica, commonly known as the Croatian pallenis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Croatia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological studies in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
