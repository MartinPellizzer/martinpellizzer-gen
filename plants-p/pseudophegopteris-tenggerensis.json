    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris tenggerensis, commonly known as the Tengger fern, is a unique species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are bipinnate, with a lanceolate shape and a serrated margin. The plant is native to the Tengger Desert in China, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in its harsh environment. The Tengger fern is adapted to survive in extreme climates, making it an important indicator of ecological resilience in desert ecosystems."
