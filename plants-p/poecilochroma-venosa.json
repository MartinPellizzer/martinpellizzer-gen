    "intro": "Poecilochroma venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
