    "intro": "Polypogon parvulus, commonly known as little blue grass, is a small, tufted grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes many other grasses. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a common weed in disturbed areas."
