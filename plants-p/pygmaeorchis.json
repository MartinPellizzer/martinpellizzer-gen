    "intro": "Pygmaeorchis, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a genus of small, terrestrial orchids native to the mountainous regions of South America. These plants typically grow in cool, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Their flowers are usually small and delicate, with a distinctive orchid-like structure that includes three sepals and three petals. Pygmaeorchis species are characterized by their short stature and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to their limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, many species within this genus are considered rare or endangered."
