    "intro": "Pogonia flabelliformis, commonly known as the flap orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, fan-shaped lip that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Pogonia flabelliformis is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
