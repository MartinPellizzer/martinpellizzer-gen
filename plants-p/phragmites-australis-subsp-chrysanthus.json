    "intro": "Phragmites australis subsp. chrysanthus, commonly known as the golden reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and long, narrow leaves that often have a golden hue, especially at the base. This subspecies is adapted to saline and brackish conditions, making it a common inhabitant of coastal marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomatous system allows it to spread rapidly, forming extensive colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant produces fluffy, white plumes that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
