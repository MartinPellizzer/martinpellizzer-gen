The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a grayish or blue-green hue due to a waxy coating. Penstemon amplus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
