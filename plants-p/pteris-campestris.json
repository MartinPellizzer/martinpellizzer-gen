    "intro": "Pteris campestris, commonly known as the field fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris campestris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate."
