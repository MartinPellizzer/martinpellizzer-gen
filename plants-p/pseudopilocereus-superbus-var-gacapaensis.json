It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts."
