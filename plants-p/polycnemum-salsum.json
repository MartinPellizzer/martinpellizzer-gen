    "intro": "Polycnemum salsum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in saline environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along shorelines. Polycnemum salsum is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
