    "intro": "Phenax concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it attaches to various host plants such as grasses and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
