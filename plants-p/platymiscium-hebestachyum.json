    "intro": "Platymiscium hebestachyum, commonly known as the yellow stinkwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It is often found in lowland evergreen forests and is valued for its durable wood, though it is also used in traditional medicine. The species is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
