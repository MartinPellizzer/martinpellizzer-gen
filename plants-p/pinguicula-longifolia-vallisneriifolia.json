    "intro": "Pinguicula longifolia vallisneriifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive, spurred shape. This species is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats."
