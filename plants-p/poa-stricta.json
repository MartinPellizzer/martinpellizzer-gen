    "intro": "Poa stricta, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns and has fine, wiry leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas. Due to its hardy nature, Poa stricta is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures and ecological restoration projects."
