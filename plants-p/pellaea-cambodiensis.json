    "intro": "Pellaea cambodiensis, commonly known as the Cambodian fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea cambodiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
