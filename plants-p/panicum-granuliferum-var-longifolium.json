    "intro": "Panicum granuliferum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf sandreed, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune habitats and salt marshes. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
