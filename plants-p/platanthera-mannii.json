    "intro": "Platanthera mannii, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with a short, rhizomatous stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spike of yellowish-green to brownish flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
