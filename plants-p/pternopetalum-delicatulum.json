    "intro": "Pternopetalum delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate pternopetalum, is a member of the Ericaceae family, native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often red or black in color, which contain the seeds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
