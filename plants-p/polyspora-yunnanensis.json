It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
