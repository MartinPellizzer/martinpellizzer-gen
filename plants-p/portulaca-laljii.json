    "intro": "Portulaca laljii, commonly known as the Indian moss or false moss, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and rocky areas. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and well-adapted to harsh climates. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
