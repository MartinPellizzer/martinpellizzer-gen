    "intro": "Phalaenopsis amabilis, commonly known as the moth orchid, is a tropical evergreen orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant flower spikes that bear multiple showy, butterfly-like blossoms. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and dark green, arranged in a fan shape around the stem. Phalaenopsis amabilis is popular as a houseplant due to its elegance and relatively easy care requirements."
