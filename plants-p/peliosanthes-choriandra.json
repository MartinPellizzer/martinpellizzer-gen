    "intro": "Peliosanthes choriandra, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Peliosanthes choriandra is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
