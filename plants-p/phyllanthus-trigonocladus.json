    "intro": "Phyllanthus trigonocladus, commonly known as the three-lobed phyllanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features opposite, trifoliate leaves with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
