    "intro": "Pepinia epiphytica, commonly known as the aerial orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than from soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pepinia epiphytica is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
