    "intro": "Pedicularis sudetica var. interior, commonly known as the Alpine monkey orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of delicate, orchid-like flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
