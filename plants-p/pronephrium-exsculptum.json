    "intro": "Pronephrium exsculptum, commonly known as the sculptured kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its unique foliage. Its fronds are slender and pinnately compound, with a distinctively sculpted surface that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
