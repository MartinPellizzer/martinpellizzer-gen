    "intro": "Polyphlebium, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often inconspicuous flowers and their ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. They are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. Polyphlebium species typically have fibrous roots and are adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Their botanical significance lies in their role as indicators of specific ecological conditions and their unique morphological features."
