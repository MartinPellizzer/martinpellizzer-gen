    "intro": "Polypodium amplum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant has broad, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
