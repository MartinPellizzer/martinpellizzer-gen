    "intro": "Pedicularis takpoensis, commonly known as the Takpoory lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, often resembling those of orchids. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it derives some of its nutrients from host plants. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
