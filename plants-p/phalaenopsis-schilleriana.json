    "intro": "Phalaenopsis schilleriana, commonly known as the Schiller's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. It is prized in horticulture for its elegance and relatively easy care requirements."
