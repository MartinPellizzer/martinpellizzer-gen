    "intro": "Prunus scoparia, commonly known as the sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern parts of the Americas. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that are used by both wildlife and humans. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments. Prunus scoparia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
