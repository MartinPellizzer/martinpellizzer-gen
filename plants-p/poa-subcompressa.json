    "intro": "Poa subcompressa, commonly known as the compressed bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly compressed along the midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, typically with two to three flowering glumes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to form dense turf, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
