    "intro": "Pedicularis tristis, commonly known as the sad lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of true roots. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive shape that resembles a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in acidic, moist habitats such as bogs and heathlands, often growing in association with coniferous trees. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
