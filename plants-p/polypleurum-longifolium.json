    "intro": "Polypleurum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved polypody, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of root hairs, which helps it absorb moisture from the environment. The leaves are usually long and narrow, with a finely divided structure that enhances their ability to capture light in low-light conditions."
