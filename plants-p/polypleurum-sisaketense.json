    "intro": "Polypleurum sisaketense, commonly known as the Sisaket fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, moss-like coating, which helps retain moisture. The Sisaket fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
