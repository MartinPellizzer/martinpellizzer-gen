    "intro": "Pityrogramma peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water fern, is a member of the Water Fern family (Pteridaceae). It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually bright green and can be either evergreen or deciduous depending on the climate. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds. Pityrogramma peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
