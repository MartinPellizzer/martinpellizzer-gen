    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. edule, commonly known as proso millet, is an annual grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its high-yield grains, which are used in food and animal feed. Its rapid growth cycle makes it a valuable crop in regions with short growing seasons. The grains are rich in nutrients and have been used for thousands of years in traditional diets."
