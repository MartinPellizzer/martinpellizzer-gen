    "intro": "Phreatia mearnsii, commonly known as the Mearns's phreatia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant typically produces large, showy inflorescences with multiple fragrant flowers, often in shades of yellow and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
