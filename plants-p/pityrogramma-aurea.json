    "intro": "Pityrogramma aurea, commonly known as the golden water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along stream edges. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pityrogramma aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
