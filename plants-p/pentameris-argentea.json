It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Pentameris argentea is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
