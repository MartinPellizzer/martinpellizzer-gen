    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia var. sphaeroides, commonly known as the globe pink, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and its clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are oval-shaped and glossy, often arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. This variety is notable for its unique spherical form, which gives it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in boreal and subalpine forests."
