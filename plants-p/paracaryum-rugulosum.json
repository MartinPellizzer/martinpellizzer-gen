It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with small, rough bumps, giving it its scientific name. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown in color. Paracaryum rugulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
