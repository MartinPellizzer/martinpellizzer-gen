    "intro": "Pouteria crotonoides, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing edible seeds. Its most notable feature is the production of the Brazil nut, which is encased in a hard, woody shell. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various wildlife species."
