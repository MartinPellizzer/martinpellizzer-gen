    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba subvar. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy bloodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in early spring, which are followed by reddish-orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing characteristic of this subspecies."
