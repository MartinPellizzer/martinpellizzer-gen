    "intro": "Plantago durvillei var. hygrophila, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It features rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in damp conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. The species is valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses including treating respiratory and digestive ailments."
