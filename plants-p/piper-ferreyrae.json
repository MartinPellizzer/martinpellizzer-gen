    "intro": "Piper ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the Andean region of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that turn red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
