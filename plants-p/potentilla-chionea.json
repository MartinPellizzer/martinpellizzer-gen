    "intro": "Potentilla chionea, commonly known as snowbank cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. Potentilla chionea plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and supports local pollinator populations."
