    "intro": "Polypodium eurybasis var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Polypodium. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often found in moist, forested areas. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually dark green and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
