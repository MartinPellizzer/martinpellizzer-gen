    "intro": "Pennisetum triticoides, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in temperate and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and panicles of spikelets that resemble a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a hardy and adaptable crop. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers contribute to its role in both agricultural and ecological systems. Pennisetum triticoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
