    "intro": "Polypodium lineare subsp. loriforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, broad, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, finger-like pinnae that give it a lush, fern-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
