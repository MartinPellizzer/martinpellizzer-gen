    "intro": "Petromarula hirtella, commonly known as the hairy rock-milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in rocky soils and withstand drought conditions. Petromarula hirtella plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
