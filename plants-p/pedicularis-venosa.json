    "intro": "Pedicularis venosa, commonly known as the purple monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking purple to reddish-pink flowers, which are often borne in clusters at the base of the stem. Its leaves are opposite and sometimes hairy, and it typically grows in moist, rocky habitats. Pedicularis venosa is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake, reflecting its semi-parasitic nature."
