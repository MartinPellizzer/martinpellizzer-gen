    "intro": "Purdiaea nipensis, commonly known as the Florida panther lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation efforts."
