    "intro": "Pandanus maximus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and recognizable appearance. The plant has a fibrous, woody stem that often grows close to the ground, with long, narrow leaves emerging from the base. Its roots are adapted to stabilize the plant in coastal and sandy soils, making it resilient to salt spray and wind. The flowers are typically small and clustered, producing fruits that are important for both wildlife and human use."
