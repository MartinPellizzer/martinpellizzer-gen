    "intro": "Phoradendron californicum, commonly known as the California mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the western United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, glossy leaves and white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its berries are red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating its spread. This species plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing food for birds and insects, which in turn help disperse its seeds."
