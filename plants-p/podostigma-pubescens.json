    "intro": "Podostigma pubescens, commonly known as the hairy podostigma, is a rare aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers. It is characterized by its specialized root system that anchors it to submerged rocks. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. It thrives in nutrient-rich, clear waters with high oxygen levels. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality."
