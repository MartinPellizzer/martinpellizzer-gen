    "intro": "Palmeria schoddei, commonly known as the Schodde's palmeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom during the warmer months and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Palmeria schoddei is considered a vulnerable species."
