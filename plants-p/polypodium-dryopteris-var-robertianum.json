It is a perennial fern characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
