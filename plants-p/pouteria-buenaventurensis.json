    "intro": "Pouteria buenaventurensis, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are typically consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in carpentry. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
