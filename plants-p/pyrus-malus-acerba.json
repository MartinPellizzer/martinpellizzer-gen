    "intro": "Pyrus malus acerba, commonly known as the bitter apple, is a species of apple tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, sour fruits that are typically not suitable for culinary use. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. The tree is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
