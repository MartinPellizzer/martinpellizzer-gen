    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. brunnea, commonly known as the dark-barked pine, is a variant of the Spanish pine, characterized by its dark, often reddish-brown bark. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Pyrenees and southern France, thriving in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more twisted compared to the standard variety. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for a long time. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
