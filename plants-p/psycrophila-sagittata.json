    "intro": "Psycrophila sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf psycrophila, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand frost and low temperatures. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
