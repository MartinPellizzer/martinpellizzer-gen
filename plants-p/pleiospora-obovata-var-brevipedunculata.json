    "intro": "Pleiospora obovata var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the narrow-peduncled pleiospora, is a fungal species belonging to the family Pleosporaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark brown, spherical to subglobose ascospores, which are typically 20\u201330 micrometers in diameter. The fungus is often found on decaying plant material, particularly in forested areas, where it plays a role in the decomposition process. Its morphology includes a cupulate stroma with a smooth, dark surface. This variant is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical variety of P. obovata."
