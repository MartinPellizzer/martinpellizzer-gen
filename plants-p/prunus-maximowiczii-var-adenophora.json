    "intro": "Prunus maximowiczii var. adenophora, commonly known as the Chinese sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-red berries that are edible but generally not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The variety is distinguished by its glandular hairs on the leaves and stems, contributing to its unique botanical identity."
