It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for their medicinal properties. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
