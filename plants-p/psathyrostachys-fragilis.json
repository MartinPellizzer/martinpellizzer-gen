    "intro": "Psathyrostachys fragilis, commonly known as the fragile wild rye, is a grass species native to central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
