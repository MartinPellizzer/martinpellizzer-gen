    "intro": "Poa breviculmis, commonly known as the short-leaved meadow grass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
