    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis var. cathypsela, commonly known as the Salzburg potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to the rocky terrain. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high sunlight exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
