    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 rollandii, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Populus deltoides and Populus nigra, resulting in a species with unique genetic characteristics. The plant is notable for its rapid growth rate, making it valuable for reforestation and phytoremediation efforts. It produces heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its catkin-like flowers are pollinated by wind. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands."
