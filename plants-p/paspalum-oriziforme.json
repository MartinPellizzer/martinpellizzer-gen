    "intro": "Paspalum oriziforme, commonly known as ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Paspalum oriziforme is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
