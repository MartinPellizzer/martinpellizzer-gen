    "intro": "Podocarpus humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas along the coasts of Chile and Peru. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
