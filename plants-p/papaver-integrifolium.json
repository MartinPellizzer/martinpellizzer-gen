    "intro": "Papaver integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes, and are typically broad and lance-shaped. Papaver integrifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, short-lived blooms."
