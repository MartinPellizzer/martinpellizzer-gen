It has opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with its stems often floating or partially submerged. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist soils and its distinctive, peppery scent when crushed. This subspecies is commonly found in marshes, pond margins, and along slow-moving waterways."
