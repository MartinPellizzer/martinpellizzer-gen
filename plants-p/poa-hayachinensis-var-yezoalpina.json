    "intro": "Poa hayachinensis var. yezoalpina, commonly known as Yezo alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It typically forms dense mats of fine, blue-green foliage and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in cool climates for ornamental purposes."
