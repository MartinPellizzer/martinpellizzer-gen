    "intro": "Paulownia lilacina, commonly known as the lilac Paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Paulowniaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and lilac, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its wood is highly valued for its lightweight and strength, making it popular in woodworking. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
