    "intro": "Pabstia viridis, commonly known as the green pabstia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the family. Pabstia viridis is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
