    "intro": "Populus flexibilis, commonly known as the trembling aspen, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches that sway easily in the wind, giving it its common name. The tree has opposite, ovate leaves that are finely toothed and turn bright yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. Populus flexibilis is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is known for its ability to form extensive clonal colonies through root sprouting."
