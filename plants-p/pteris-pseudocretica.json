    "intro": "Pteris pseudocretica, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often have a wavy or curled appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, spongy layer that aids in water retention. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators."
