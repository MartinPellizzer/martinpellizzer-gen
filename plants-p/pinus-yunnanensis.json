    "intro": "Pinus yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan pine, is a medium-sized evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its straight, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green needles that grow in pairs. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forest ecosystems at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for numerous plant and animal species."
