    "intro": "Pultenaea insularis, commonly known as the island pultenaea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments. Pultenaea insularis is often found in coastal heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
