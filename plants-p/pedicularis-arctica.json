    "intro": "Pedicularis arctica, commonly known as the Arctic beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear whorled leaves and spikes of tubular, pink or purple flowers. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by long-tongued insects such as bees and butterflies. Pedicularis arctica is well-suited to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
