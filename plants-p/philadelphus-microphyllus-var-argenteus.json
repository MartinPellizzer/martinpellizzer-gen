    "intro": "Philadelphus microphyllus var. argenteus, commonly known as silver-leaf mockorange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are densely covered with silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for small gardens or as a hedging plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
