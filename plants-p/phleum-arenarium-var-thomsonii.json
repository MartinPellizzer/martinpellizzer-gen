    "intro": "Phleum arenarium var. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences contribute to its distinctive appearance. Thomson's bluegrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in xeriscaping and wildlife habitat restoration."
