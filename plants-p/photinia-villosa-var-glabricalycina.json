    "intro": "Photinia villosa var. glabricalycina, commonly known as the glossy leaf photinia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is shiny and leathery, providing a striking visual contrast to its red or pink inflorescences. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it ideal for hedges or as a specimen plant in gardens."
