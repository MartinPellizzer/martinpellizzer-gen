    "intro": "Ptychopyxis frutescens, commonly known as the silky glabrous tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ptychopyxis frutescens is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates."
