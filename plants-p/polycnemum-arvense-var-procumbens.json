    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its sprawling growth habit. It features slender, often reddish stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
