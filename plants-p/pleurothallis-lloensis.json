    "intro": "Pleurothallis lloensis, commonly known as the Lloens Lizard Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
