    "intro": "Polygonum rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaved knotweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, riverbanks, and marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a valuable plant in traditional medicine. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils and its adaptability to varying water conditions."
