    "intro": "Phoradendron huehuetecum, commonly known as the sacred mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody, evergreen stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as ceiba and mahogany, through its haustellum, which allows it to extract water and nutrients. It produces white or pale yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its cultural significance in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies, it holds a special place in both ecological and historical contexts."
