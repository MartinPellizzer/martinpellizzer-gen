    "intro": "Parthenocissus quinquefolia var. vitacea, commonly known as the Boston ivy, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically five-lobed, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its vigorous growth habit makes it popular for covering walls and trellises in gardens. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, adding ornamental value to landscapes."
