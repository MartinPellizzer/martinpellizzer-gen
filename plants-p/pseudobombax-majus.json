    "intro": "Pseudobombax majus, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. The plant has a robust, buttressed trunk and can grow up to 20 meters in height, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it produces woody, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Pseudobombax majus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
