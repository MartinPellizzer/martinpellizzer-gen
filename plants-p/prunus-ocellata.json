    "intro": "Prunus ocellata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yaezakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, single-layered flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant produces small, edible fruits known as cherries, which are similar to those of other Prunus species. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. Prunus ocellata is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and cultural significance in Japanese gardens."
