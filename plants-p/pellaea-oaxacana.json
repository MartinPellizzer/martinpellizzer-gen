    "intro": "Pellaea oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca spleenworts, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. Pellaea oaxacana is typically found in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on limestone or in crevices. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on adaptation to arid and nutrient-poor habitats."
