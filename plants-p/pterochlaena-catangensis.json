    "intro": "Pterochlaena catangensis, commonly known as the catangensis fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape and have a serrated margin. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to moist soil and substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
