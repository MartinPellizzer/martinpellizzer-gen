    "intro": "Pereskia rosea, commonly known as the rose prickly pear, is a unique cactus species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its woody, tree-like stems covered in short, stiff spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically small and covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Pereskia rosea is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local cultures."
