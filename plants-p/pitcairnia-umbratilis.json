    "intro": "Pitcairnia umbratilis, commonly known as the shadow pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia umbratilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
