    "intro": "Pappophorum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular pappus grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often bear small, glandular structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Pappophorum glandulosum is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
