    "intro": "Pimpinella anisetum, commonly known as Japanese parsley or anise weed, is a biennial or annual herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic, often parsley-like foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along streambanks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
