It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Paspalum leucotrichum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
