    "intro": "Pedicularis mandshurica var. coreana, commonly known as the Korean lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea and northeastern China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite and often covered with a fine layer of hairs, while its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
