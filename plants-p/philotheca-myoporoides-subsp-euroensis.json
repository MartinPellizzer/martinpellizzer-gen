    "intro": "Philotheca myoporoides subsp. euroensis, commonly known as the Euroe Island leafless thorned bush, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, glandular, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
