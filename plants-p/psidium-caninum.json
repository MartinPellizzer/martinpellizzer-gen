    "intro": "Psidium caninum, commonly known as the dogwood guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow or red when mature. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and, to a lesser extent, for its edible fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
