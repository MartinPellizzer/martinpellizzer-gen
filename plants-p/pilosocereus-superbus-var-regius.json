    "intro": "Pilosocereus superbus var. regius, commonly known as the Queen of the Night, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
