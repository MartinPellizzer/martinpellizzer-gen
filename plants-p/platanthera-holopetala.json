    "intro": "Platanthera holopetala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has slender, wiry stems and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
