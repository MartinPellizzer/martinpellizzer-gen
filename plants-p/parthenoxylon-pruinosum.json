    "intro": "Parthenoxylon pruinosum, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that exfoliates easily, revealing a lighter inner layer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, with a glossy upper surface and a pale, often whitish underside. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flattened seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing some degree of drought tolerance."
