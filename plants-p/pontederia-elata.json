    "intro": "Pontederia elata, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Americas. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with vibrant blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots help stabilize soil in shallow waters, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Pontederia elata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic biodiversity."
