    "intro": "Periploca afzelii, commonly known as the African moonseed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, with smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red fruits that split open to release flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Periploca afzelii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions."
