It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a valuable component of native ecosystems."
