    "intro": "Pellaea atropurpurea f. bifida, commonly known as the purple fringed mountain fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to reddish foliage and distinctive, bifid (split) fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually leathery and have a rough texture, contributing to its adaptability in various soil types."
