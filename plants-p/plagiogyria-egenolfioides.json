It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and unique reproductive structures, which are adapted to its specific ecological niche. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in high-altitude regions with cool climates. Its morphology includes a creeping stem with clustered leaves, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
