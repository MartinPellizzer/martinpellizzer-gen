    "intro": "Peperomia rupestris, commonly known as the stonecrop peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green, red, or purple, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is a popular choice for container gardening and rock gardens."
