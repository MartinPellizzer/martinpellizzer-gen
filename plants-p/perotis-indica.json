    "intro": "Perotis indica, commonly known as Indian spinach, is an annual herb native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Perotis indica is valued for its edible leaves, which are used in traditional cuisines for their mild, spinach-like flavor."
