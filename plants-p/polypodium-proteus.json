    "intro": "Polypodium proteus, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of pale, woolly hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen and remain viable for several years, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
