    "intro": "Persica pendula, commonly known as the weeping peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible peach-like fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and they turn vibrant yellow in the fall. Persica pendula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
