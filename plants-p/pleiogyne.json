    "intro": "Pleiogyne, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their showy, blue or purple flower heads that resemble mist or smoke, hence the common name. Pleiogyne species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with rough, bark-like stems. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
