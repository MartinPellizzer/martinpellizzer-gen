It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Poeppigia densiflora is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
