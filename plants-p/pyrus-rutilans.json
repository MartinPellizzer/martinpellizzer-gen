    "intro": "Pyrus rutilans, commonly known as the golden apple tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Japan. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellowish flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit, a small apple-like berry, ripens in late summer and is edible, though not as widely cultivated as other apple varieties. Pyrus rutilans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
