    "intro": "Pseudosmodingium pterocarpum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a member of the Rhamnaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with a dense canopy and smooth, greyish bark. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and glossy green, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
