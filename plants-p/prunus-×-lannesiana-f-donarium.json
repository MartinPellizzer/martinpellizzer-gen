    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. donarium, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a botanical variant of the Prunus genus, characterized by its distinctive double blooms. This form exhibits flowers with multiple layers of petals, giving it a more elaborate and showy appearance compared to single-flowered varieties. It is typically found as a cultivar of Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana, which is a hybrid between Prunus serrula and Prunus lusitanica. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, particularly in gardens and landscapes where visual appeal is a priority. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture, though it may be less hardy in colder climates than other cherry species."
