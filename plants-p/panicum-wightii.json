It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a slight sheen. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. Panicum wightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
