    "intro": "Prunus nana proles campestris, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or low-growing cherry shrub, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, with multiple stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or black berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
