    "intro": "Pentaphiltrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions against the forest floor. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical marvel from habitat loss and illegal collection."
