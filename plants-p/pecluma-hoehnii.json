    "intro": "Pecluma hoehnii, commonly known as the Hohmann's pecluma, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Tanzania and Kenya. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pecluma hoehnii is considered a plant of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
