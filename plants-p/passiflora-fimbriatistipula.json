It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a blend of purple, white, and yellow hues. The plant produces tendrils that aid in climbing and supports its growth on trees or shrubs. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with finely serrated edges. The fruit, which develops from the flower, is a small, edible berry with a sweet, aromatic flavor."
