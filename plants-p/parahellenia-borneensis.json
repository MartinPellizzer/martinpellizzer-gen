    "intro": "Parahellenia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean parahellenia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are fibrous and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss, Parahellenia borneensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
