    "intro": "Polypogon nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal grass, is a perennial grass native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountain meadows. The plant has slender, erect culms with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small and compact. Polypogon nepalensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
