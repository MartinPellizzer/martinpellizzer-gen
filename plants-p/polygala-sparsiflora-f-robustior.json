    "intro": "Polygala sparsiflora f. robustior, commonly known as the robust polygala, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, raceme-like inflorescences. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with a unique structure that includes a spurred petal, which is a key feature of the genus. This variety is noted for its greater size and robust growth compared to the typical form of Polygala sparsiflora. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
