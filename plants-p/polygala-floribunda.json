    "intro": "Polygala floribunda, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
