    "intro": "Pulicaria dysenterica subsp. uliginosa, commonly known as bog groundsel, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in a single terminal head and bloom in early summer. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils and support biodiversity."
