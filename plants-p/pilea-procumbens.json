    "intro": "Pilea procumbens, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that grow in a rosette pattern on short, horizontal stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea procumbens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
