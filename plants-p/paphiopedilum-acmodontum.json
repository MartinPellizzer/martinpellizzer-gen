    "intro": "Paphiopedilum acmodontum, commonly known as the Philippine ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green to white petals and a distinctive, recurved lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and fragrant, blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its rarity and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
