    "intro": "Pedicularis olympica, commonly known as the Olympic lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Pedicularis olympica is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients."
