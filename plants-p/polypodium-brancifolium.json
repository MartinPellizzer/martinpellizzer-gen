    "intro": "Polypodium brancifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's delicate, feathery appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
