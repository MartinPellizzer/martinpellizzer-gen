    "intro": "Pteris crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris crassipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
