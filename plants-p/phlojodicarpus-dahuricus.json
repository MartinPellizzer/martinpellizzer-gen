    "intro": "Phlojodicarpus dahuricus, commonly known as the Siberian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Phlojodicarpus dahuricus is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, often found in alpine or arctic regions."
