    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria subsp. incana, commonly known as silver sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically has silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its adaptability to cold climates makes it an important component of polar and alpine ecosystems."
