    "intro": "Pararistolochia peninsulensis, commonly known as the Florida pipevine, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiral-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple veins. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are blue or black when mature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
