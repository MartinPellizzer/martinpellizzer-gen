    "intro": "Platycerium andinum, commonly known as the Andean staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that resemble the horns of a stag. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds from the air and rain. Its growth is slow, and it often attaches itself to tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat. The fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture, providing a striking visual contrast to the surrounding environment."
