    "intro": "Pinus montana var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog pine, is a variant of the white pine species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slow growth and adaptation to wet, acidic soils, often found in peat bogs and other moist environments. The tree has a conical shape with dense, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of other pine species. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for many years, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. This variety plays an important part in maintaining the structure and biodiversity of its wetland habitats."
