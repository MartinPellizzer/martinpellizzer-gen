    "intro": "Poa nivalis, commonly known as snow grass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a low-growing perennial species that thrives in cold, alpine, and arctic environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Poa nivalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in harsh climates."
