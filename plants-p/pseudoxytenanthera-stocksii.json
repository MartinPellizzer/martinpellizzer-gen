    "intro": "Pseudoxytenanthera stocksii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing three seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
