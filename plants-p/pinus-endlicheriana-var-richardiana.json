    "intro": "Pinus endlicheriana var. richardiana, commonly known as the Richard's white pine, is a variant of the white pine species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The cones of this species are usually small and cylindrical, with scales that open to release the seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
