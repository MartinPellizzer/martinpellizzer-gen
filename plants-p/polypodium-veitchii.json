    "intro": "Polypodium veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, segmented stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Polypodium veitchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
