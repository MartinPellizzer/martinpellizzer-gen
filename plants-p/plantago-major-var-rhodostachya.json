    "intro": "Plantago major var. rhodostachya, commonly known as the red-stalked plantain, is a variant of the common plantain. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, red-tinged flower spikes that rise above the foliage, making it visually distinct from the typical green-stalked variety. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique coloration."
