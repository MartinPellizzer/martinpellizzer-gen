    "intro": "Poa compressa var. subcompressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, compressed leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. This variety is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland floors or along streambanks. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
