It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual display to the landscape. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as drupes, which contain a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth margin, turning yellow in the fall. Prunus coccinea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
