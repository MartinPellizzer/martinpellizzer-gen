    "intro": "Pleudia hillcoatiae, commonly known as the Hillcoat's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and sepals that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of old rainforest trees, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and its extremely limited distribution, Pleudia hillcoatiae is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
