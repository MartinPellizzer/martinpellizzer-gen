    "intro": "Populus alba var. canescens, commonly known as the white poplar with silvery leaves. It is a variant of the white poplar, characterized by its distinctive silvery or greyish pubescence on the underside of its leaves. This plant is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while the tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is a deciduous tree that can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 20 meters in suitable conditions."
