    "intro": "Pinus soulangeana, commonly known as the Japanese red pine, is a deciduous conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and its ability to shed its needles annually, a rare trait among pines. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones being woody and reddish. Its needles are typically 5\u20138 cm long, arranged in bundles of five, and have a reddish hue when young. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique appearance."
