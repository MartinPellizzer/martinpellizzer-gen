    "intro": "Pitcairnia rondonicola, commonly known as the Rondonia pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central pool to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid tropical environment. Pitcairnia rondonicola is often found growing on trees or in shaded understories of dense rainforests."
