    "intro": "Pinguicula gracilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring or early summer. Pinguicula gracilis is often found in wetlands and is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
