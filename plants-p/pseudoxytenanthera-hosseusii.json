    "intro": "Pseudoxytenanthera hosseusii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and workability. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
