    "intro": "Poupartia silvatica, commonly known as the silverwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance."
