It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, spiny bracts beneath its flowers, which help in seed dispersal. The species is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world."
