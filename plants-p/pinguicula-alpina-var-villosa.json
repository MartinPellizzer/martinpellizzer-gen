    "intro": "Pinguicula alpina var. villosa, commonly known as the Alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It possesses sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the summer months. This variety is notable for its adaptations to cold, alpine environments and its unique method of nutrient acquisition."
