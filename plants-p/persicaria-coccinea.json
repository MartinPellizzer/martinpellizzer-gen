    "intro": "Persicaria coccinea, commonly known as redroot pigweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright red stems that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branching inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and they tend to be more prominent near the base of the plant. Persicaria coccinea is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
