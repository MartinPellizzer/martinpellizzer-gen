    "intro": "Plantago dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties."
