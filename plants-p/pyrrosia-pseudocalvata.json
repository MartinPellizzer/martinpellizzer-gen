    "intro": "Pyrrosia pseudocalvata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Pyrrosia pseudocalvata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
