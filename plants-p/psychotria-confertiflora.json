    "intro": "Psychotria confertiflora, commonly known as the \"Cocaine plant,\" is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, which are followed by small, round berries. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly cocaine, which is found in the leaves and stems. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is both economically significant and subject to strict regulation."
