    "intro": "Platanus orientalior, commonly known as the oriental plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its distinctive, smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain 2\u20134 seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. The oriental plane tree is also valued for its shade and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
