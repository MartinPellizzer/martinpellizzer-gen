    "intro": "Phoradendron ceibanum, commonly known as the ceiba mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the ceiba tree (Ceiba pentandra) in tropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some photosynthetic ability from its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for wildlife."
