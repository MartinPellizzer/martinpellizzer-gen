    "intro": "Panicum petrense, commonly known as the coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime habitats. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces fluffy, pale blue to silver-gray seed heads that are highly visible in the landscape. It is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for erosion control and landscape design in coastal areas."
