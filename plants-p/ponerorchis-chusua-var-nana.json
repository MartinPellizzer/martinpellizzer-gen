    "intro": "Ponerorchis chusua var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, small, greenish-white flower. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs or along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are inconspicuous and lack the showy features typical of many orchids, but it is notable for its unique ecological niche. The species is of interest to botanists due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution."
