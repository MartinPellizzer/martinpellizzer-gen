    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. serotina, commonly known as the late-fruiting blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, dark purple berries that ripen later in the season compared to the typical blackthorn. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the fruiting period in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye, and the plant plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
