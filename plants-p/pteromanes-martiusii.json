    "intro": "Pteromanes martiusii, commonly known as the Malabar orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, narrow, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in montane regions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and certain moths, and it has specific mycorrhizal associations that are crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are essential to ensure its survival in the wild."
