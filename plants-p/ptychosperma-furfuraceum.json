    "intro": "Ptychosperma furfuraceum, commonly known as the silky cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense, silky layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is pollinated by specific insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Ptychosperma furfuraceum is an important component of Madagascar's unique flora and is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
