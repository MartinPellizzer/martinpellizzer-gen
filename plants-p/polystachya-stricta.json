    "intro": "Polystachya stricta, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sword fern, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, lance-shaped leaves that resemble a sword, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
