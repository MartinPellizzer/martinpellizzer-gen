    "intro": "Pedicularis kawaguchii, commonly known as the Japanese lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive hooded shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
