    "intro": "Papaver persicum subsp. persicum, commonly known as the Persian poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow, often with a blackened center. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous elaterium seeds, which are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The Persian poppy is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for centuries in gardens and traditional medicine."
