    "intro": "Pinus tlamacaensis, commonly known as the Tlamacaensis pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a coniferous tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five, and it produces cones that contain its seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to high-altitude environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
