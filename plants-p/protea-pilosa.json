    "intro": "Protea pilosa, commonly known as the woolly protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, spherical inflorescence composed of numerous small, petal-like bracts that are often densely covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant typically grows in fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and red, and are pollinated by insects and birds. Protea pilosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and floral arrangements."
