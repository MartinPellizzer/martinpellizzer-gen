    "intro": "Phacelia pinnatifida var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent phacelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, lavender-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and wildflower meadows. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
