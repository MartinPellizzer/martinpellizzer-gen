    "intro": "Polypodium angustifolium var. solutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wall fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed polypodium. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often tightly clustered at the base. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates like stone or soil. This variety is notable for its delicate, feathery fronds and is often found in temperate regions."
