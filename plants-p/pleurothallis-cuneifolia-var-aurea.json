It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking golden-yellow inflorescence. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming in the late spring or early summer. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
