    "intro": "Prestonia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf prestonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, often woody stems and broad, rounded leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, toxic seeds. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
