    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subvar. sulphurellum, commonly known as the sulphur poppy, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow-orange flowers, which contrast vividly with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
