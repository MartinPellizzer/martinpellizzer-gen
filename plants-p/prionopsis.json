    "intro": "Prionopsis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves that give them a distinctive appearance. Prionopsis species are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in shaded or moist environments. The flowers are small and clustered, usually in umbels, and the plants are often used in ornamental gardening. They are also valued for their ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and their relatively low maintenance requirements."
