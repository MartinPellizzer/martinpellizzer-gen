    "intro": "Pollinia articulata, commonly known as the articulated pollinia plant, is a species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring elongated, segmented pollinia that are attached to a stalk. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a mild, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its specialized morphology, it plays a role in particular pollination networks within its ecosystem."
