    "intro": "Phaeopappus galactochrous, commonly known as the golden-hued pappus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, velvety texture. Its fruit is a small, hairy capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
