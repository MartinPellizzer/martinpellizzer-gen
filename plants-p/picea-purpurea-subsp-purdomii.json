    "intro": "Picea purpurea subsp. purdomii, commonly known as the purple spruce, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged foliage, which becomes more pronounced in cooler temperatures. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in subalpine and alpine environments. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
