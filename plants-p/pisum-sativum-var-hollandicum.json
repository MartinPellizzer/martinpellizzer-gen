    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. hollandicum, commonly known as the Dutch pea, is a variety of the common pea plant characterized by its compact growth habit and early maturing traits. It features small, edible pods that contain several seeds, typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which are followed by the development of the pods. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for both its edible seeds and ornamental value. This variety is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces due to its bushy growth form."
