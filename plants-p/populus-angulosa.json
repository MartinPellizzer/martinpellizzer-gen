    "intro": "Populus angulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and floodplains, and is often found in riparian zones. Populus angulosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
