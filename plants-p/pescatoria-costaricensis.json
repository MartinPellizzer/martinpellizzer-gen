    "intro": "Pescatoria costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican pescatoria, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
