    "intro": "Pouzolzia hypericifolia, commonly known as the coastal pouzolzia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
