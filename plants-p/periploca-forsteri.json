    "intro": "Periploca forsteri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Periploca forsteri plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments."
