    "intro": "Pinus abies var. leioclada, commonly known as the white spruce, is a variant of the European spruce native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical variety. The cones are elongated and often hang downward, containing small, winged seeds. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
