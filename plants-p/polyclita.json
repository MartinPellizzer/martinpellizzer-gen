    "intro": "Polyclita, commonly known as the spurge or milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic and can cause skin irritation. Polyclita species are typically herbaceous, with simple leaves and showy, clustered flowers that are often yellow or green. They are found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and woodland edges. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
