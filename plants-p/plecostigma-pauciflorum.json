It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or white. It is often found in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
