    "intro": "Poa hartzii subsp. alaskana, commonly known as Alaska bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and tundra. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Due to its cold tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in cooler climates for landscaping purposes."
