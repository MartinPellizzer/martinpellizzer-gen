    "intro": "Primula acaulis subsp. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic primrose, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Balearic Islands. It features clustered, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit with hairy, dark green leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
