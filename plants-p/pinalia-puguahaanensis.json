    "intro": "Pinalia puguahaanensis, commonly known as the Puguahaan pinalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, woolly leaves and showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Pinalia puguahaanensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
