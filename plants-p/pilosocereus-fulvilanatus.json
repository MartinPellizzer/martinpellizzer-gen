    "intro": "Pilosocereus fulvilanatus, commonly known as the golden candelabra cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that are covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
