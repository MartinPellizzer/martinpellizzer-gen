    "intro": "Pterocarpus ulei, commonly known as African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Ghana and Nigeria. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
