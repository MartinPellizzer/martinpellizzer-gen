    "intro": "Pamea, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers and specialized structures such as the labellum and column. Pamea species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. They have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are often adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The genus includes numerous species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
