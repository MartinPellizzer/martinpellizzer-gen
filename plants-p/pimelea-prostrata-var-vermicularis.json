    "intro": "Pimelea prostrata var. vermicularis, commonly known as the prostrate bottlebrush, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often cascade over rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
