    "intro": "Phaseolus neglectus, commonly known as the wild kidney bean, is a species of legume native to the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Phaseolus species. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers, which are followed by pods containing small, round seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Botanically, it is notable for its potential as a forage crop and its genetic relationship to cultivated beans."
