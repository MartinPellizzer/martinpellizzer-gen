It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its seeds are small and clustered, often dispersed by wind, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. However, it can be invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
