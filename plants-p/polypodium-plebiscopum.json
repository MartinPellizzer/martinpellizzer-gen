    "intro": "Polypodium plebiscopum, commonly known as the plebiscopum fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce numerous stolons, which help in vegetative propagation. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds."
