    "intro": "Peniocereus castellanosii, commonly known as the Castellanos's night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that open at night, a characteristic feature of many night-blooming cacti. Its flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a single night, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. This cactus is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water to survive."
