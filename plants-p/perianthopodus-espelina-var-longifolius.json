    "intro": "Perianthopodus espelina var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved perianthopodus, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is known for its finely divided, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often arranged in umbels, a common trait in the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
