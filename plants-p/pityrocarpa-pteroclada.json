    "intro": "Pityrocarpa pteroclada, commonly known as the Mexican white cedar, is a species of flowering plant in the family Capparaceae. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Mexico and parts of Central America. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers and fleshy, red fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Pityrocarpa pteroclada is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
