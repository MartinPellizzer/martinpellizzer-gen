    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 aranensis, commonly known as the alpine lungwort, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Pyrenees. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of violet or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are basal, often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps protect it from cold and wind. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh, sunny conditions."
