    "intro": "Potentilla vilijuga, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Potentilla vilijuga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
