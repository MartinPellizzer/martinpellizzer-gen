It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a dense spike that emerges from the center of the rosette. It thrives in a variety of soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are characterized by their rough texture and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
