    "intro": "Pyrola elliptica, commonly known as the oval snowbell, is a perennial evergreen herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, where it thrives in acidic soil conditions. The plant features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Pyrola elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators."
