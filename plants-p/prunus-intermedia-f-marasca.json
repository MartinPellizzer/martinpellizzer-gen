It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that ripen in late summer, known for their intense tart flavor and high concentration of antioxidants. The plant has a dense, bushy growth habit with thornless stems and oval, dark green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for small gardens or container cultivation. The marasca cherry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedging or as a specimen plant."
