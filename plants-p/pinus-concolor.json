    "intro": "Pinus concolor, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive white bark and needle-like leaves that are typically two to three inches long. The tree produces cones that mature over two years, with the outer scales falling off to release the seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The whitebark pine plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
