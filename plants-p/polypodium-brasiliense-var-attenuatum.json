    "intro": "Polypodium brasiliense var. attenuatum, commonly known as the Brazilian wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
