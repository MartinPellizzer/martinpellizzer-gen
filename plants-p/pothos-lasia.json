    "intro": "Pothos lasia, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a golden or variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more celebrated for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in low-light conditions and is highly tolerant of neglect, making it a popular houseplant. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it versatile for indoor gardening."
