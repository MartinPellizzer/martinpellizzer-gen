    "intro": "Potamogeton foliosus subsp. foliosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 2\u20138 millimeters wide and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its habitat."
