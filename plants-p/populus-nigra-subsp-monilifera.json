    "intro": "Populus nigra subsp. monilifera, commonly known as the black poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces catkins that release pollen in the spring, contributing to its role in wind-pollination. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found near rivers and along waterways. This subspecies is valued for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
