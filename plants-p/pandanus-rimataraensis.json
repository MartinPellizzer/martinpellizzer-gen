    "intro": "Pandanus rimataraensis, commonly known as the Rimatara pandanus, is a species of palm native to the island of Rimatara in the Society Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its inflorescences produce small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. The fruit, which is a fibrous husk enclosing a single seed, is an important resource for both local ecosystems and human use."
