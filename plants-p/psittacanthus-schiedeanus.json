    "intro": "Psittacanthus schiedeanus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and its distinctive fronds that are bright green with a golden hue along the midrib. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
