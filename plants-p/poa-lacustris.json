    "intro": "Poa lacustris, commonly known as lake grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands, lake margins, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each containing several small, two-lobed flowers. Poa lacustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small aquatic organisms."
