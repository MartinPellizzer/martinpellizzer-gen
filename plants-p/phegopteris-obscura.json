    "intro": "Phegopteris obscura, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, shield-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous stolons, which help in vegetative propagation. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
