    "intro": "Paepalanthus canastrensis, commonly known as the Canastrensis Puya, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
