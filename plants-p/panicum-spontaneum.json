It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, red or reddish-brown spikelets. The plant typically grows in open areas, such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in wet or moist environments. Its flowering period usually occurs in the summer months, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Panicum spontaneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
