    "intro": "Panicum strictum var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with bristly bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
