    "intro": "Paraboea lambokensis, commonly known as the Lambok paraboea, is a climbing plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
