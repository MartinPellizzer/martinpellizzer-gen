    "intro": "Peltandra canadensis, commonly known as Canadian arrowhead, is a wetland plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has arrowhead-shaped leaves that are alternate and have a distinctive notched base. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, while its fruits are three-winged seeds that disperse by wind. Peltandra canadensis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
