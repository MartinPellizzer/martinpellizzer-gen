    "intro": "Ptelea cycloloma, commonly known as the California boxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It is valued for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental appeal and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
