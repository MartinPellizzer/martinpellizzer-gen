    "intro": "Polypodium laxum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, aiding in water storage. Polypodium laxum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded, humid gardens."
