    "intro": "Poa dumetorum, commonly known as mousegrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance with slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
