    "intro": "Porcelia saffordiana, commonly known as the Safford's porcelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
