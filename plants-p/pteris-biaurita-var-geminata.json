    "intro": "Pteris biaurita var. geminata, commonly known as the twin-veined water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into two symmetrical halves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are covered in small, scale-like structures that help retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in aquatic gardens."
