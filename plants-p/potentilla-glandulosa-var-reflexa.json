It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically five-lobed, hence the common name \"cinquefoil,\" and are covered in glandular dots. This perennial shrub thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
