It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in hue. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and drought tolerance. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in both gardens and as a houseplant."
