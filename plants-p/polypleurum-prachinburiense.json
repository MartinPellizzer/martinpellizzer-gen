    "intro": "Polypleurum prachinburiense, commonly known as the Prachinburi fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Thailand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a unique, segmented structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, hairy structures, which help in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
