These plants are characterized by their unique floral structures, often featuring showy, lip-like petals and specialized pollination mechanisms. Many Platystylis species are epiphytic, growing on trees and rocks in humid environments. They typically have slender, upright stems and are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture. The genus is notable for its ecological importance in supporting native pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in Australian ecosystems."
