    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera subsp. iranica, commonly known as the Iranian cherry, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black when mature, though they are often used for ornamental purposes rather than consumption. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
