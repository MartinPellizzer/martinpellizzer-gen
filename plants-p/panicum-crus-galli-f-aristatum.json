    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli f. aristatum, commonly known as bearded bluestem, is a flowering grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, stiff bristles along the leaf sheaths, giving it its distinctive \"bearded\" appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, blue-green spikelets that mature to a golden hue. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and disturbed areas. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
