    "intro": "Pterocarya spinosa, commonly known as the spiny wingnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and have serrated margins. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by woody, winged fruits that contain a single seed. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its roots are deep and extensive, making it adaptable to various soil types. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
