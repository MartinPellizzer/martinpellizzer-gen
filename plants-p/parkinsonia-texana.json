    "intro": "Parkinsonia texana, commonly known as Texas huisache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and extreme temperatures. Parkinsonia texana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
