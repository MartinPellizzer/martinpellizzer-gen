    "intro": "Pelexia flabellilabia, commonly known as the broad-leaved pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Pelexia flabellilabia is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
