    "intro": "Primula firmipes var. erythra, commonly known as the red-flowered primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, red or orange-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers are typically pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
