    "intro": "Psychotria misolensis, commonly known as the Mindanao psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers, which are typically arranged in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
