    "intro": "Psoralea decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Psoralea decumbens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
