    "intro": "Palaquium sericeum var. acutocalyx, commonly known as the silky palaquium, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale gray bark and elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible drupes with a sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for local consumption."
