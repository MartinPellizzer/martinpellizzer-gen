    "intro": "Pteris nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal water fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. Pteris nepalensis plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
