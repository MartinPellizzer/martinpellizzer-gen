It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in a distinctive rough, textured surface. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy coating and serrated edges, contributing to its rugged appearance. It produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom during the warmer months. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
