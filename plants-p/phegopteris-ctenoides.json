    "intro": "Phegopteris ctenoides, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are deeply divided and covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The hairy shield fern plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
