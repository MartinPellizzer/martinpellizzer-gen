    "intro": "Pulicaria adenophora, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Pulicaria adenophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
