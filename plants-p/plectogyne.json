    "intro": "Plectogyne, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Plectogyne species are valued for their durable timber and are also used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction."
