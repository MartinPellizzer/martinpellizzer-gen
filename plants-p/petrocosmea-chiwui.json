    "intro": "Petrocosmea chiwui, commonly known as the Chiwu rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province, China. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, violet-blue petals with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops, adapting to nutrient-poor and well-drained substrates. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Petrocosmea chiwui is considered a conservation concern."
