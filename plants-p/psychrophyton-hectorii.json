    "intro": "Psychrophyton hectorii, commonly known as the Hector's ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its delicate, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, windy conditions of its coastal habitat. It has a short life cycle, with the plant flowering and setting seed within a few months before dying. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
