    "intro": "Panicum pubifolium, commonly known as the hairy-leaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for seed heads, which are actually sterile. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
