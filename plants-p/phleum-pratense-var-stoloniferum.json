    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a valuable forage plant."
