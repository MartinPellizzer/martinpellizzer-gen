    "intro": "Phaseolus compressus var. fulvoater, commonly known as the yellow-seeded scarlet bean, is a variant of the scarlet bean species native to Central and South America. It is a climbing legume with compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods. The seeds are typically yellow or orange in color, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Phaseolus. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
