    "intro": "Pleione fuscescens, commonly known as the dark pleione, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to brownish flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, typically in shaded forest understories. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Pleione fuscescens is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
