    "intro": "Physaria grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like seed capsules. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Physaria grahamii is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
