It features thick, waxy leaves with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the midrib, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in terminal clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia persulcata is relatively low-maintenance, requiring minimal water and tolerating a range of temperatures."
