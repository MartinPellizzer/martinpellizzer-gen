It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, producing a fragrant aroma. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
