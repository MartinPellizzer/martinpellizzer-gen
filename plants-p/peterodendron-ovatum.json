    "intro": "Peterodendron ovatum, commonly known as the oval-leaf pittosporum, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
