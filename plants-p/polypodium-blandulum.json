    "intro": "Polypodium blandulum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, narrow shape. Polypodium blandulum is notable for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
