    "intro": "Pilea purulensis, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to South America. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, forming a low, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the axils of the leaves, which are usually greenish-white in color. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Pilea purulensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
