It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various organisms. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it a resilient and valuable component of maritime ecosystems."
