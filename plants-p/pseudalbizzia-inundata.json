    "intro": "Pseudalbizzia inundata, commonly known as the water acacia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, making it tolerant of flooded conditions. The tree is sometimes used in reforestation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
