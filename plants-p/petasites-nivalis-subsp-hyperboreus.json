    "intro": "Petasites nivalis subsp. hyperboreus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a rounded inflorescence. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas in its harsh habitat."
