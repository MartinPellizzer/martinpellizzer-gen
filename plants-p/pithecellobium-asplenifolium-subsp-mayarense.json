    "intro": "Pithecellobium asplenifolium subsp. mayarense, commonly known as the Mayare\u00f1o acacia, is a shrub native to parts of South America. It features small, bipinnate leaves that are often mistaken for ferns due to their delicate, feather-like appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a legume pod containing edible seeds, which are rich in nutrients. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or disturbed soils."
