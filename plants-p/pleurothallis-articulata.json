    "intro": "Pleurothallis articulata, commonly known as the articulated pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, often pendulous inflorescences and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique growth habit includes a sympodial structure, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Pleurothallis articulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
