It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to retain moisture in harsh, windy environments. Pedicularis salina plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
