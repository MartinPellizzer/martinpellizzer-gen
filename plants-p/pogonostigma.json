It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pogonostigma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
