    "intro": "Populus pruinosa, commonly known as the silver poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its white-woolly underside on its leaves, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. Populus pruinosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and streams."
