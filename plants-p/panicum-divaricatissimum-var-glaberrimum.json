    "intro": "Panicum divaricatissimum var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
