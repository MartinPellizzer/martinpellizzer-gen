    "intro": "Pyrostria borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon palm, is a flowering plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, spiny fruit, which is adapted for dispersal by animals. Pyrostria borbonica is often found in moist, shaded environments within the island's tropical forests."
