    "intro": "Panicum ensifolium, commonly known as swordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow, sword-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish to reddish seed heads that are visually striking and attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscape design."
