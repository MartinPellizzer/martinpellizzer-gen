    "intro": "Panicum brachyurum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Panicum brachyurum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
