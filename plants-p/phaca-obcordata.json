    "intro": "Phaca obcordata, commonly known as the heartleaf phaca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Phaca obcordata is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
