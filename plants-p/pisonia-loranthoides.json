    "intro": "Pisonia loranthoides, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are alternate and simple, often with a waxy texture, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Pisonia loranthoides is often found growing on trees, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
