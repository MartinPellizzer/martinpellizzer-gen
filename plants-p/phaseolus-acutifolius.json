    "intro": "Phaseolus acutifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bean or Mexican bean, is a species of legume native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and pointed, and its pods that contain several small, edible seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as the seeds are rich in protein and fiber. It thrives in warm climates and is adapted to grow in various soil types, making it a versatile crop. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
