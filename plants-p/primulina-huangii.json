    "intro": "Primulina huangii, commonly known as the Huang's Primulina, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Primulina huangii thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
