It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. The showy parmena is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
