    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleiosprios compactus, commonly known as the compact moon cactus, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, swollen, and often colorful stem that resembles a moon, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick, and fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and appear in late summer. Due to its compact size and unusual appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
