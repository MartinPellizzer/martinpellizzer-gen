    "intro": "Perityle saxosa, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or desert regions. Perityle saxosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
