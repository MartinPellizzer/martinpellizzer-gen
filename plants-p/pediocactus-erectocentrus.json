It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has spiny, ribbed stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pediocactus erectocentrus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in dry climates."
