    "intro": "Parosela mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
