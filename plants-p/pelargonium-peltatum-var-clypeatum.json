    "intro": "Pelargonium peltatum var. clypeatum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid cultivar of the geranium genus. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, slightly waxy leaves that are heart-shaped with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is often used in hanging baskets and as a decorative ground cover due to its lush foliage and ornamental value. This variety is relatively easy to care for, thriving in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
