    "intro": "Panicum thrasya, commonly known as the red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, pinkish-branched inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open areas such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more prominent as the plant matures. Panicum thrasya is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and airy flower structure."
