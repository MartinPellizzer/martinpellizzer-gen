    "intro": "Peucedanum trinioides, commonly known as the Three-lobed Caraway, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring temperate climates. Its seeds, similar in appearance to those of caraway, are used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Peucedanum trinioides is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
