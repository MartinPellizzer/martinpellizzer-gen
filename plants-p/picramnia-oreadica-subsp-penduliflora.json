    "intro": "Picramnia oreadica subsp. penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower picramnia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that often hang downward, giving it its common name. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a slightly hairy surface. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique floral structure and ornamental value."
