It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming from late summer into early autumn. Narrowleaf smartweed thrives in moist soils, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
