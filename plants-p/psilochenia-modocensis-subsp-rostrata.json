    "intro": "Psilochenia modocensis subsp. rostrata, commonly known as the Modoc Valley psilochenia, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Modoc Plateau in California. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
