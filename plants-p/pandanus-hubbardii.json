    "intro": "Pandanus hubbardii, commonly known as the Hubbard's pandanus, is a species of palm native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, spiky fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be woven into mats and thatching materials. Pandanus hubbardii thrives in coastal and wetland areas, often growing in sandy or muddy soils."
