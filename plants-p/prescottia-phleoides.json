    "intro": "Prescottia phleoides, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prescottia phleoides is considered a vulnerable species."
