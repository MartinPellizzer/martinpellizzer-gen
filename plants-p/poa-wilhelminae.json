    "intro": "Poa wilhelminae, commonly known as the Wilhelmine's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Poa wilhelminae is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
