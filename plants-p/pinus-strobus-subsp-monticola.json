It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, soft needles that grow in bundles of five. The cones are relatively small and have a distinctive shape, with scales that open to release the seeds. This subspecies thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
