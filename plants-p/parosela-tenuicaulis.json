    "intro": "Parosela tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed parosela, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale purple, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Parosela tenuicaulis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
