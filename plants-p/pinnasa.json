    "intro": "Pinnasa, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. Pinnasa is valued for its heartwood, which is highly prized in perfumery and traditional medicine. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a significant component of tropical forest ecosystems."
