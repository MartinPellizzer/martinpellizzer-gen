    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. argerichiana, commonly known as the Argentino Cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to Argentina. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant has a short, thick stem with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, opening in the morning and closing by midday. This variety is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
