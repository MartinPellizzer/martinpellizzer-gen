    "intro": "Panicum isocalycinum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and woodland habitats. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
