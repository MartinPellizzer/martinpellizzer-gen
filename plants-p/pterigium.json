    "intro": "Pterigium, commonly known as a \"wing spot\" or \"grower's eye,\" is a benign, non-cancerous growth that develops on the conjunctiva of the eye. It typically appears as a fleshy, triangular-shaped lesion near the inner corner of the eye, often extending onto the cornea. Botanically, it is not a plant but a medical condition; however, the term \"pterigium\" originates from the Greek word \"pterygion,\" meaning wing, due to its resemblance to a wing. It is often associated with environmental factors such as exposure to UV radiation and dry air. While not a plant, the term is sometimes confused with botanical terms due to its name."
