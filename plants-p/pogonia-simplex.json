    "intro": "Pogonia simplex, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a unique visual element to the forest floor. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
