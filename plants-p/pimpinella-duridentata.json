    "intro": "Pimpinella duridentata, commonly known as the broad-leaved cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, which releases small, hairy seeds when mature. Pimpinella duridentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
