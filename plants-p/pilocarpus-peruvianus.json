    "intro": "Pilocarpus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian jurema, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils at high altitudes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has elliptical, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It is particularly noted for containing the alkaloid pilocarpine, which has various pharmacological applications. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
