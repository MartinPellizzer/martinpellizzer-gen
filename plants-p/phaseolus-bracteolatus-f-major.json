    "intro": "Phaseolus bracteolatus f. major, commonly known as the large bracteolate bean, is a cultivated variant of the common bean species. It is characterized by its larger leaves and more robust growth habit compared to typical Phaseolus species. The plant produces pods that are generally longer and contain larger seeds, making it a notable form for agricultural use. Botanically, it exhibits typical Phaseolus features, including compound leaves and flowers with five petals. This form is of interest in plant breeding for its potential to enhance yield and adaptability in different growing conditions."
