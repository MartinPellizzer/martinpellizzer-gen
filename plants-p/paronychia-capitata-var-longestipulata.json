    "intro": "Paronychia capitata var. longestipulata, commonly known as the long-stipule sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a dense mat of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive and adapted for survival in nutrient-poor soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
