    "intro": "Pteropyrum scoparium, commonly known as the lesser marsh-elder, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Pteropyrum scoparium is adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
