    "intro": "Plocoglottis quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that often display a four-leaf pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in horticulture."
