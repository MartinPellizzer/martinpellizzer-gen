It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its compound leaves and male and female flowers that appear on separate trees. The tree produces small, round fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically smooth with a grayish-white appearance, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Padus virginalis is valued for its strong wood and is often found in riparian habitats."
