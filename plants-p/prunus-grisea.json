    "intro": "Prunus grisea, commonly known as the gray cherry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark purple fruits called drupes. Prunus grisea is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
