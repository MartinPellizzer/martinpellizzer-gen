    "intro": "Prosthechea tigrina, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers with a distinctive pattern resembling a tiger's stripes, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Prosthechea tigrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
