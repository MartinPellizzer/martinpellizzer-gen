    "intro": "Primula auriculata var. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features rosettes of narrow, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings where it can mimic its natural habitat."
