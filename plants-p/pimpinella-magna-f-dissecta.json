    "intro": "Pimpinella magna f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cowparsley, is a variant of the cowparsley species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are often more delicate than those of the typical species. Its flowers are small, white, and arranged in umbels, typical of theApiaceae family. The botanical characteristics of this form make it distinct in appearance and ecological niche compared to other members of the species."
