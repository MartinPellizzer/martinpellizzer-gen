    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. stipitatum, commonly known as the stipitate opium poppy, is a botanical variant of the opium poppy characterized by its distinctive stipitate (warty) nodes on the stem. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a purple or pink hue. Its latex contains alkaloids such as morphine and codeine, making it both medicinally significant and subject to strict legal regulation. Due to its potential for misuse, cultivation of this variety is heavily restricted in many countries."
