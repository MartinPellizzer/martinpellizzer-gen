It typically grows in wet rainforest or swampy areas, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, helmet-shaped flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow hue. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by the flower's odor and color. The orchid's morphology is adapted to its specific ecological niche, showcasing the intricate relationships between plant structure and environmental conditions."
