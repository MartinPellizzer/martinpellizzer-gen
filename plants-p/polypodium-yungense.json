    "intro": "Polypodium yungense, commonly known as the Yungas polypody, is a fern species native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in regions of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium yungense plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
