    "intro": "Pluchea macrocephala, commonly known as the giant blueweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to purple composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable ecological component and a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
