    "intro": "Pilea tutensis, commonly known as the Chilean money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is native to Chile and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick and fleshy, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. It is a popular houseplant due to its ease of care and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Pilea tutensis is also noted for its ability to propagate through stem cuttings, making it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
