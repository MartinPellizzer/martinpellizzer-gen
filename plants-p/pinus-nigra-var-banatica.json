    "intro": "Pinus nigra var. banatica, commonly known as the Banat pine, is a subspecies of the black pine native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree produces pale yellow to reddish-brown cones, which contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across southeastern Europe. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
