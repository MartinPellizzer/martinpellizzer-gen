    "intro": "Pedilanthus fendleri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
