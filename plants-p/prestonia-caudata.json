    "intro": "Prestonia caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed prestonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
