    "intro": "Pleopeltis meyeniana, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, light green color and a rough, fibrous texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests, where it plays a role in the ecological structure of the understory."
