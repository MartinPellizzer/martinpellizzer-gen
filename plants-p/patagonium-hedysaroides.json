    "intro": "Patagonium hedysaroides, commonly known as the Patagonian sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in racemes. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. Patagonium hedysaroides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range."
