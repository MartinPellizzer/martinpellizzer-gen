    "intro": "Pandanus singaporensis, commonly known as the Singapore pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often grouped in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its fibrous roots and sturdy structure make it well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching due to their durability and flexibility."
