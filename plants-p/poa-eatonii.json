    "intro": "Poa eatonii, commonly known as Eaton's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
