    "intro": "Pinus squamosa, commonly known as the scaly pine, is a species of conifer native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of two to five. The tree produces cones that are usually reddish-brown in color and contain winged seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. The scaly pine is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine."
