It is characterized by its compact, fleshy, and often spiny leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice among cactus and succulent enthusiasts."
