    "intro": "Pleurothallis langlassei, commonly known as the Langlasse's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
