    "intro": "Phaca humillima, commonly known as the dwarf phaca, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, narrow leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
