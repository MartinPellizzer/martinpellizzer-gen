    "intro": "Peucedanum adae, commonly known as the Armenian cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels. Its seeds are small, dry, and often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive benefits. Peucedanum adae is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
