The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. Perama hirsuta is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
