    "intro": "Prasophyllum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and small, pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found on rocky outcrops and limestone hills. Its unique morphology and specialized habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Prasophyllum calcicola plays an important role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
