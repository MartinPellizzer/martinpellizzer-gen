    "intro": "Panax ornatus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, yellowish roots and lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested regions. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of ginsenosides, which are bioactive compounds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
