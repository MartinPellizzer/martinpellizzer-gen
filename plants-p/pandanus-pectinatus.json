    "intro": "Pandanus pectinatus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are both ornamental and ecologically significant. It thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing in brackish or saline soils. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is cultivated in various tropical regions for landscaping and cultural purposes."
