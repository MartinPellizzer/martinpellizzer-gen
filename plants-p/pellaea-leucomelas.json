It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pellaea leucomelas is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
