    "intro": "Platycodon glaucus var. rugosus, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white throat. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
