    "intro": "Peperomia suspensa, commonly known as the hanging peperomia, is a compact, trailing plant native to South America. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its trailing growth habit, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a decorative filler in containers."
