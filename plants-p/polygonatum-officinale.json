    "intro": "Polygonatum officinale, commonly known as the Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and forest understories. Its rhizomatous root system makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal medicine."
