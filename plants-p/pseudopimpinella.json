    "intro": "Pseudopimpinella, commonly known as the false pimpinella, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. They are native to various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in rocky or disturbed soils. Pseudopimpinella species are generally herbaceous, with some varieties being annual or biennial. Their botanical features make them valuable for ecological studies and as ornamental plants in gardens."
