    "intro": "Populus minhoensis, commonly known as the Minho poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive bark. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found near rivers and streams. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, followed by the development of samaras for seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
