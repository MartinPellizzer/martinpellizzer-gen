    "intro": "Platanthera sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its distinctive floral structure, which consists of a loose raceme of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and swampy areas. It is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
