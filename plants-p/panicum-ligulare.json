    "intro": "Panicum ligulare, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments and for its role in supporting local wildlife. The species is also sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
