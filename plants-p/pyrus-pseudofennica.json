    "intro": "Pyrus pseudofennica, commonly known as the Fennoscandian pear, is a rare and unique species of pear native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible pomes that ripen in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
