    "intro": "Polypodium polypodioides var. michauxianum, commonly known as the Michaux's polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in lines along the veins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The varietal form michauxianum is distinguished by its slightly different frond morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form."
