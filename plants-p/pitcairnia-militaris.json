    "intro": "Pitcairnia militaris, commonly known as the military pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
