    "intro": "Phenax asper, commonly known as the rough phenax, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, rough hairs that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Phenax asper is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
