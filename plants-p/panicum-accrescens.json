    "intro": "Panicum accrescens, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, reddish-brown florets. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Panicum accrescens is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
