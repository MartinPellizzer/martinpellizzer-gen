    "intro": "Phalaris rotgesii, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Phalaris rotgesii is often found in dunes and along the edges of tidal zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
