It is characterized by its fine, silver-colored foliage and dense growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental use. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged, adding to its aesthetic appeal. Paspalum affine is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments."
