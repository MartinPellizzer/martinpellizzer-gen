    "intro": "Polygonum vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Vvedensky knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Polygonum vvedenskyi plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and short growing seasons."
