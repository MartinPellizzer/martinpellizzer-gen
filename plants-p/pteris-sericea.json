    "intro": "Pteris sericea, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Pteris sericea plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
