    "intro": "Peperomia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, elongated flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Peperomia longiflora is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
