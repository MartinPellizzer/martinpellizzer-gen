    "intro": "Pitcairnia torresiana var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant flowers, often in red or orange hues. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
