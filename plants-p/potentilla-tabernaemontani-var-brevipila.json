    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani var. brevipila, commonly known as the short-stemmed cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features wiry, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
