    "intro": "Polygonum rhizocaulon, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Polygonum rhizocaulon is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
