    "intro": "Psammisia salmonea, commonly known as the golden sandbloom, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or desert margins. Due to its resilience, it is used in xeriscaping and for stabilizing loose soil in harsh environments."
