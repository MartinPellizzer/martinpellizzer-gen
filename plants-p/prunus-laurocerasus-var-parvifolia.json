    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf cherry laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the standard Prunus laurocerasus. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by dark purple berries. It is valued for its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, requiring caution in landscaping."
