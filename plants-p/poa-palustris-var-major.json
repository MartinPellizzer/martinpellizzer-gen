    "intro": "Poa palustris var. major, commonly known as the tall marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
