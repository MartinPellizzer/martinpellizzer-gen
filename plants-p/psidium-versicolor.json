    "intro": "Psidium versicolor, commonly known as the variable guava, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent and vary in color from green to reddish. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. Its fruit is usually yellow or orange when ripe and has a sweet, slightly acidic flavor. Psidium versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also cultivated for its edible produce."
