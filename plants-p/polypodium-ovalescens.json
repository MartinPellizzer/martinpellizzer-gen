    "intro": "Polypodium ovalescens, commonly known as the oval fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproduction."
