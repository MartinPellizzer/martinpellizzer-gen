    "intro": "Parakeelya uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower parakeelya, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces a single, elongated flower per stem, which is surrounded by specialized bracts that resemble leaves. Its habitat includes rocky outcrops and coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
