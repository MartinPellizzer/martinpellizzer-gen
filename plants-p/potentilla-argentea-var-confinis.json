    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. confinis, commonly known as silver potentilla or mountain silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy foliage that reflects sunlight and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and alpine habitats, often growing at high elevations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
