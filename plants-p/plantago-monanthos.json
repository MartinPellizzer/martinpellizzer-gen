    "intro": "Plantago monanthos, commonly known as the narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are clustered near the top of the stem. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a useful plant for erosion control."
