    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. macrantha, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting foliage."
