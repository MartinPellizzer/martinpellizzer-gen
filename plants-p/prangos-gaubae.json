    "intro": "Prangos gaubae, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments. Prangos gaubae is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
