    "intro": "Polypodium aoristisorum, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India and China. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the humid seasons."
