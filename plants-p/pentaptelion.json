    "intro": "Pentaptelion, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass or *Pentaptelion angustifolium*, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
