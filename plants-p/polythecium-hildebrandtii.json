    "intro": "Polythecium hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's polypody, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in specialized leaflets called sporophylls. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
