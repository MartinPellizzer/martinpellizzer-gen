    "intro": "Pleurogramme graminoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering pollutants. Pleurogramme graminoides is an important species for aquatic ecosystems due to its role in maintaining habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
