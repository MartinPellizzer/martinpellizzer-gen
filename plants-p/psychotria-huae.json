    "intro": "Psychotria huae, commonly known as the Hawaiian psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests, often in the understory where it receives filtered sunlight. Psychotria huae is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage and floral display. However, it is also considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species competition."
