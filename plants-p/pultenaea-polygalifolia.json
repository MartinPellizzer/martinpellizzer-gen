    "intro": "Pultenaea polygalifolia, commonly known as the golden pultenaea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, which are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. These flowers are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important component of local ecosystems. Its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in full sun make it a popular choice for native gardens."
