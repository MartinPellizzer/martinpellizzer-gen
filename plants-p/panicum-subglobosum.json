    "intro": "Panicum subglobosum, commonly known as the globular panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a grass species characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are small and clustered in dense, rounded spikes. Panicum subglobosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
