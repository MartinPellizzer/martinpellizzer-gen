    "intro": "Podocarpus neglectus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf podocarp, is a species of evergreen conifer native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures, typical of coniferous species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Podocarpus neglectus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
