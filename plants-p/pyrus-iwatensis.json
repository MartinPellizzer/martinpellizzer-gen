    "intro": "Pyrus iwatensis, commonly known as the Iwat Islands pear, is a rare species native to the Philippines. It is a deciduous tree belonging to the Rosaceae family, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus iwatensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
