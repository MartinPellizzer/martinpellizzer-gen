    "intro": "Pteris incisa var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its feathery, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that allows for efficient water retention. This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the standard Pteris incisa."
