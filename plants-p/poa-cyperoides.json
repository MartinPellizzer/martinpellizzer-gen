    "intro": "Poa cyperoides, commonly known as the meadow grass or slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which can stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Poa cyperoides is often found in disturbed sites and is valued for its ecological role in maintaining healthy ecosystems."
