It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. Its fruit is edible, though it is less commonly cultivated than other guava species. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
