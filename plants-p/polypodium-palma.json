    "intro": "Polypodium palma, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a dense mass of roots that anchor it to trees or rocks. Its fronds are typically evergreen and can grow up to 1 meter in length. Polypodium palma thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
