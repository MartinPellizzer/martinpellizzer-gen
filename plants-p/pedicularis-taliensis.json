    "intro": "Pedicularis taliensis, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
