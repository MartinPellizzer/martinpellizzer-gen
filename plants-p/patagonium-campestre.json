    "intro": "Patagonium campestre, commonly known as the Patagonian fieldweed, is a flowering plant native to the grasslands of southern South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Patagonian region. Due to its resilience and ecological role, it is an important component of the local flora."
