    "intro": "Prunus persica var. pleiocarpa, commonly known as the multi-fruited peach, is a variant of the peach tree characterized by its unique ability to produce multiple fruiting structures on a single stem. This variety exhibits a compact growth habit with dense foliage, making it suitable for smaller gardens or container cultivation. The flowers are typically pink to white, and the fruits are smaller than standard peaches, often with a more intense flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use, though it is less commonly cultivated commercially. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
