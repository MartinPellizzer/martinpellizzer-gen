    "intro": "Pombalia potosina, commonly known as the Potosino bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet petals and is often found growing in rocky soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Pombalia potosina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
