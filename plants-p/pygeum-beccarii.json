    "intro": "Pygeum beccarii, commonly known as the African prickly pear, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spine-tipped stems and clustered, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pygeum beccarii is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand periods of drought."
