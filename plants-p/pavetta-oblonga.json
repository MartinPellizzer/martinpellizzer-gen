    "intro": "Pavetta oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf pavetta, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which are typically followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Pavetta oblonga is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
