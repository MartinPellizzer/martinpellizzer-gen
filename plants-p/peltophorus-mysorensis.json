    "intro": "Peltophorus mysorensis, commonly known as the Mysore fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its unique, palm-like fronds that are often described as resembling a tree fern. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clusters of bright green, fan-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
