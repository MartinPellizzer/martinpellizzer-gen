    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. friedrichsenii, commonly known as the Friedrichsen's cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
