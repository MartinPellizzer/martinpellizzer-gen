    "intro": "Pteris serrulata var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often variegated with shades of green and yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller pinnae that are themselves divided again, creating a lacy appearance. This varietal form is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
