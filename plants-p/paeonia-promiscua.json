    "intro": "Paeonia promiscua, commonly known as the meadow peony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves and produces underground rhizomes that help it spread and establish colonies. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Paeonia promiscua is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
