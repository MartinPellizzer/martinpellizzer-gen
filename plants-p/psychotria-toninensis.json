    "intro": "Psychotria toninensis, commonly known as the Tonin's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, dark blue berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Psychotria toninensis is also notable for its potential psychoactive properties, though further research is needed to confirm its effects."
