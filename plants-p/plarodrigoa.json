    "intro": "Plarodrigoa, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Plarodrigoa is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
