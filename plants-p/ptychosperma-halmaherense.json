    "intro": "Ptychosperma halmaherense, commonly known as the Halmahera cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Halmahera in Indonesia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
