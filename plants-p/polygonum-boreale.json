    "intro": "Polygonum boreale, commonly known as Arctic knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Polygonum boreale plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
