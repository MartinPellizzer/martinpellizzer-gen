    "intro": "Pleconax macrodonta, commonly known as the giant pleconax, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant produces spores in spherical, clustered structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
