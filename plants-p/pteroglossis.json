    "intro": "Pteroglossis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically showy, with five petals that are usually brightly colored, ranging from pink to red. They produce capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. Pteroglossis species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
