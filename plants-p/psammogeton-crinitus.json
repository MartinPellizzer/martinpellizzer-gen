    "intro": "Psammogeton crinitus, commonly known as the hairy sandburs, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its rough, branched stems and small, spiny fruits. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by the development of dry, hairy burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Psammogeton crinitus thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its distinctive appearance and adaptive features make it a common weed in arid and semi-arid environments."
