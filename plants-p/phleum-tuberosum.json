    "intro": "Phleum tuberosum, commonly known as tussock grass or mountain grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, fibrous roots and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish to pale blue flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Phleum tuberosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
