    "intro": "Peperomia tecticola, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are not showy but attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia tecticola is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
