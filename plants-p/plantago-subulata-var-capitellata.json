    "intro": "Plantago subulata var. capitellata, commonly known as the snowplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a frost-covered appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a compact cluster at the tip of the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
