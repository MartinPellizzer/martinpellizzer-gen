    "intro": "Populus trinervis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves with three prominent veins. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Populus trinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
