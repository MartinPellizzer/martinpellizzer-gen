    "intro": "Poa erectifolia var. scabriflora, commonly known as the rough-flowered bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers that are typically green to reddish in color. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable species within the Poaceae family."
