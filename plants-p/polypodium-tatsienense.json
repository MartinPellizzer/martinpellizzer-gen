    "intro": "Polypodium tatsienense, commonly known as the Sichuan wall fern, is a species of polypody found primarily in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded substrates. The plant has a compact, creeping rhizome with numerous upright fronds that are usually dimorphic, featuring both sterile and fertile leaves. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae, and the sori are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique ecological adaptations."
