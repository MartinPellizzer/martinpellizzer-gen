    "intro": "Pteris verticillata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, ponds, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant in aquatic substrates. Pteris verticillata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
