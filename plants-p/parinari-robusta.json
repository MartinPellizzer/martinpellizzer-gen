    "intro": "Parinari robusta, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for furniture and construction. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in some regions."
