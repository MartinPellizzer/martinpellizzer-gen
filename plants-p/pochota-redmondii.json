It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, large heart-shaped leaves, and showy, pale pink to white flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
