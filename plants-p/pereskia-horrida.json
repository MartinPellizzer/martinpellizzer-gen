    "intro": "Pereskia horrida, commonly known as the rough pereskia, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Pereskia horrida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
