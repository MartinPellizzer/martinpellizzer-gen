    "intro": "Phaedranassa megistophylla, commonly known as the giant leaf orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural habitat, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
