    "intro": "Pseudobaeckea villosa, commonly known as the silky baeckea, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for coastal and garden landscapes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native gardens."
