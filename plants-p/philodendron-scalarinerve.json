    "intro": "Philodendron scalarinerve, commonly known as the scalineve philodendron, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped to ovate leaves with a distinctive scalloped margin, often with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are a feature of its reproductive cycle. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense foliage in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil for optimal growth."
