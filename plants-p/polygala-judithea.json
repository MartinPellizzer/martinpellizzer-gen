    "intro": "Polygala judithea, commonly known as the Judita's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and delicate, often pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
