It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and spikes of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
