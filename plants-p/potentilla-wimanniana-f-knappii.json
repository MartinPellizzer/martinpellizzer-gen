It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with finely divided leaves that help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in challenging climates."
