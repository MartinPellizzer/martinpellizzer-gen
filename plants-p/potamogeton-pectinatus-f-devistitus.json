It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and is important for aquatic ecosystems."
