    "intro": "Poa glauca var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and ornamental landscapes. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 inches and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in turfgrass mixes and erosion control applications."
