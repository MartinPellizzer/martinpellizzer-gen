It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces burrs with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads."
