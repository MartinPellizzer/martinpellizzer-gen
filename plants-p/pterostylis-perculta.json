    "intro": "Pterostylis perculta, commonly known as the golden helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is often yellow or golden in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understoreys and has a short, erect stem with a single, showy flower. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms."
