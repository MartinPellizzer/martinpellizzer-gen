    "intro": "Pinus rubra, commonly known as the red pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. The cones of Pinus rubra are woody and often remain attached to the tree for several years. This species thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of forest ecosystems in its native range."
