    "intro": "Primula chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden leaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its foliage is notable for its vibrant coloration, which is a result of high concentrations of carotenoids. Primula chrysophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
