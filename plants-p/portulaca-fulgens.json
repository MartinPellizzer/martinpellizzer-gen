    "intro": "Portulaca fulgens, commonly known as the blazing star or fireplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often blooming in summer. Portulaca fulgens is well adapted to hot, dry conditions and requires minimal water once established. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
