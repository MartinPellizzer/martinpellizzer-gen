    "intro": "Pyrus tamamschiannae, commonly known as the Armenian white pear, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, white flowers in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, preferring cooler and temperate climates. Its fruit, a small pear-like apple, is edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
