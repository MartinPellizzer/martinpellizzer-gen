    "intro": "Panicum psilanthum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It typically forms dense mats or tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a common component of dryland vegetation. Its structure and growth habit make it useful for erosion control and as a forage plant in certain regions."
