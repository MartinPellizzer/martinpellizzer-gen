    "intro": "Polypodium trifurcatum var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed cliff fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into three parts, giving it a distinctive trifoliate appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are dispersed through the wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
