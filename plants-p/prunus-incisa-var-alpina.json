    "intro": "Prunus incisa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-red drupes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
