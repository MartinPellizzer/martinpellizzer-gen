    "intro": "Puccinellia capillaris, commonly known as silky grass or slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and streambanks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually short and compact. Puccinellia capillaris is often found in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
