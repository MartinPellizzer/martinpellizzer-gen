    "intro": "Plectocomia andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's plectocomia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, where it thrives in sandy soils and saline environments. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit, narrow leaves, and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Plectocomia andersonii is considered a rare and endangered species."
