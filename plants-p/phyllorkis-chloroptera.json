    "intro": "Phyllorkis chloroptera, commonly known as the green-winged fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a bright green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Phyllorkis chloroptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
