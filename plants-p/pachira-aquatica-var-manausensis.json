    "intro": "Pachira aquatica var. manausensis, commonly known as the Manaus elephant ear, is a variant of the water chestnut plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in diameter, giving it a dramatic and tropical appearance. The plant thrives in moist, well-draining soil and prefers indirect sunlight, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its stems are often swollen at the nodes, a feature that distinguishes it from other Pachira species. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
