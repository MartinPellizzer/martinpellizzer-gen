    "intro": "Paris aprica, commonly known as the spring bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the woodlands of Europe. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, oval-shaped berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, often appearing in clusters along the stems. Paris aprica thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens."
