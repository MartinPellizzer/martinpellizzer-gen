    "intro": "Plectaneia volubilis, commonly known as the creeping plectane, is a climbing plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to cling to surfaces, making it a common sight in rocky or wooded areas. Plectaneia volubilis is known for its adaptability and is often used in ornamental gardening."
