    "intro": "Pycreus cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that often display a combination of white, green, and purple hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments near waterfalls or streams, where it benefits from the constant humidity and nutrient-rich soil. Its unique floral structure includes specialized lip petals that aid in pollination by attracting specific insect species. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Pycreus cataractarum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
