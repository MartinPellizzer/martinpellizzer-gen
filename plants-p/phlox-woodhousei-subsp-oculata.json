    "intro": "Phlox woodhousei subsp. oculata, commonly known as the Sierra phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The Sierra phlox is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
