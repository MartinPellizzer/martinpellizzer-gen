    "intro": "Platycerium grande var. normale, commonly known as the giant staghorn fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Australia and New Guinea. It is characterized by its large, antler-like fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, giving it a distinctive and dramatic appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds and a network of aerial roots. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often seen growing on trees or rock surfaces. Its unique morphology and ability to form dense, lush foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
