    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium var. natans, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its floating, leafless stems that bear small, bladder-like structures. These bladders are used to capture and store tiny aquatic organisms, which the plant then absorbs for nutrients. It thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant's leaves are often submerged, with specialized structures that aid in buoyancy and gas exchange. Its unique adaptations make it an important part of aquatic ecosystems."
