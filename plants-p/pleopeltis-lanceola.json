It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, glossy appearance."
