    "intro": "Potentilla cordata, commonly known as heartleaf potentilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are heart-shaped, which is reflected in its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both gardeners and botanists."
