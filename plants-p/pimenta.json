    "intro": "Pimenta, commonly known as allspice, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. Its fruit, known as the allspice berry, is harvested when fully ripe and dried, giving it a distinctive aromatic profile reminiscent of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. The plant produces small, dark red berries that contain aromatic seeds used in cooking and traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires a long growing season. The botanical name *Pimenta dioica* reflects its dioecious nature, with separate male and female plants."
