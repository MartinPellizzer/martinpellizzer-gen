    "intro": "Poa dinantha, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa dinantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
