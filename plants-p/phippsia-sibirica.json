    "intro": "Phippsia sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian phippsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers during the late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
