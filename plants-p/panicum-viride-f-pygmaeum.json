    "intro": "Panicum viride f. pygmaeum, commonly known as green panic grass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and erosion control in warm climates."
