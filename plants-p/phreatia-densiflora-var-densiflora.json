    "intro": "Phreatia densiflora var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered phreatia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and broad, fleshy leaves that store moisture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb water from the surrounding soil, making it well-suited for humid, shaded environments. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
