It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds.
