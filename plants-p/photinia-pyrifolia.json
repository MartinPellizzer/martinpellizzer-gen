    "intro": "Photinia pyrifolia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange-red flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning vibrant red in the fall. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms and seasonal foliage changes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
