    "intro": "Porophyllum lineare f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows as a low, herbaceous perennial with narrow, linear leaves that are broader in this particular form. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, semi-desert environments."
