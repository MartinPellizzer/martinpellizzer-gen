It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with densely packed, hairy leaves that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Pilosella \u00d7 valsiana is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, and it is considered a common weed in many regions."
