    "intro": "Polygonum setaceum var. typicum, commonly known as the slender knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
