    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea subsp. subacaulis, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. It is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in open meadows or along streambanks. The subspecies subacaulis is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stems compared to other forms of Potentilla cinerea."
