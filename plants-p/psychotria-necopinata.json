    "intro": "Psychotria necopinata, commonly known as the \"Cocaine Plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains alkaloids, including cocaine, which has been historically harvested for its psychoactive properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its chemical composition, it has significant ecological and medicinal importance in its native habitat."
