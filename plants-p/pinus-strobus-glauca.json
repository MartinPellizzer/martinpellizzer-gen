    "intro": "Pinus strobus glauca, commonly known as the white pine, is a species of conifer native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically two inches in length and have a bluish-white underside. The tree produces cones that are usually 2 to 4 inches long and contain edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in forested areas. The bark is thick and furrowed, providing a distinctive appearance as the tree matures."
