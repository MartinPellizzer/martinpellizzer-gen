    "intro": "Polymnia maculata, commonly known as the spotted polymnia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. The plant features small, pale green leaves with distinctive reddish or brownish spots, which give it its common name. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are usually white or pale pink in color. Polymnia maculata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in wetland restoration projects."
