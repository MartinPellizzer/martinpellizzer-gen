    "intro": "Protea villifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved protea, is a striking member of the Proteaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous pale pink to cream-colored flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, a common trait among proteas. Its flowering period occurs mainly during the winter months, attracting a variety of pollinators such as birds and insects. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
