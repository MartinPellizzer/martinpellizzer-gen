    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Europe. It features small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are short and broad, adapted for efficient insect capture in nutrient-poor environments. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal regions."
