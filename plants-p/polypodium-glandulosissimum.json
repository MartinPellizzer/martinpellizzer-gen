    "intro": "Polypodium glandulosissimum, commonly known as the glandular fern, is a species of polypody that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in small, glandular dots, giving it its common name. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The plant is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
