    "intro": "Philadelphus microphyllus subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, glossy, ovate leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blossoms and pleasant scent, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller leaves and more compact growth compared to other members of the Philadelphus genus."
