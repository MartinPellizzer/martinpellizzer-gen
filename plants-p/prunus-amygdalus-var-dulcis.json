    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus var. dulcis, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and Southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its ovate leaves with serrated edges and its fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, green fruits called drupes, which mature into the familiar almond nuts. These nuts are encased in a hard shell and are rich in oils and nutrients, making them valuable for both culinary and industrial uses. The plant is also cultivated for its ornamental value and is commonly found in gardens and orchards."
