It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate appearance that makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
