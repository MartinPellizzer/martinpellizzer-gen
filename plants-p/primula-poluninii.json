    "intro": "Primula poluninii, commonly known as the Polunin's primrose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at high altitudes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Primula poluninii is considered a species of conservation concern."
