    "intro": "Passovia janeirensis, commonly known as the Janeirensis Starflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in northern Peru. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale blue, typically during the early spring season. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its slender, upright stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices and mountain meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Passovia janeirensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
