It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits enclosed in a papery calyx that turns orange-red as the fruit matures. These fruits are edible when fully ripe and have a tangy, sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown as an ornamental or for its edible berries."
