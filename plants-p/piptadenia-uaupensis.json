    "intro": "Piptadenia uaupensis, commonly known as the Brazilwood tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark red wood, which was historically used for fine cabinetry and musical instruments. The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, particularly for its anti-inflammatory properties."
