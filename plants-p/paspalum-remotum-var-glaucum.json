    "intro": "Paspalum remotum var. glaucum, commonly known as bluegrass paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
