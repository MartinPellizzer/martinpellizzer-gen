    "intro": "Pleopeltis superficialis, commonly known as the rock holly, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis superficialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
