    "intro": "Phegopteris queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Australia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spores located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris queenslandica plays an important ecological role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
