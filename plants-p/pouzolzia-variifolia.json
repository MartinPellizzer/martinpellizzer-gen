    "intro": "Pouzolzia variifolia, commonly known as the variable pouzolzia, is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive foliage. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. Pouzolzia variifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade."
