    "intro": "Pseudotrimezia cipoana, commonly known as the Cipoan rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, lanceolate fronds with a waxy surface, adapted to its arid and rocky environment. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudotrimezia cipoana is considered a vulnerable species."
