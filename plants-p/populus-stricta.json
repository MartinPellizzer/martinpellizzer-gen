    "intro": "Populus stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin layers as the tree matures. Populus stricta is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas."
