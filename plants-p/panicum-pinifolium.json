    "intro": "Panicum pinifolium, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
