    "intro": "Phoradendron robaloense, commonly known as the Robalo's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own chlorophyll for some photosynthesis. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, facilitating its spread to new hosts. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting bird life and contributing to forest biodiversity."
