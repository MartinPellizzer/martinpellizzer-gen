    "intro": "Puccinellia oresigena, commonly known as the mountain saltbush, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. This perennial herb is adapted to harsh environments, featuring a low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, silver-gray leaves. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. The plant is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate saline conditions."
