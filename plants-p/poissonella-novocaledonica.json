    "intro": "Poissonella novocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia poissonella, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
