    "intro": "Pandanus glomerosus, commonly known as the clustered pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Its roots and leaves are sometimes used in traditional practices, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appearance. The species is adapted to coastal and humid environments, making it a resilient plant in tropical climates."
