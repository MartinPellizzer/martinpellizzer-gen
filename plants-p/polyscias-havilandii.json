    "intro": "Polyscias havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's gloryberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Polyscias havilandii is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a versatile choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
