    "intro": "Physalis crassifolia f. muriculata, commonly known as the rough-hairy groundcherry, is a variant of the groundcherry plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery calyx, similar to other Physalis species. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
