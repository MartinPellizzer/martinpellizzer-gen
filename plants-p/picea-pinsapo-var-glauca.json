    "intro": "Picea pinsapo var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous silver fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The tree has a slow growth rate and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Its cones are typically small and cylindrical, and it produces both male and female cones on the same tree. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
