    "intro": "Panax fissus, commonly known as the fissured ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, although they are less commonly used than those of Panax ginseng. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Panax fissus is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
