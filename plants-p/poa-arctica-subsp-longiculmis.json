    "intro": "Poa arctica subsp. longiculmis, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, and thrives in open, rocky habitats. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
