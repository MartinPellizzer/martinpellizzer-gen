    "intro": "Platanthera chlorantha var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in North America. It features a slender, branching stem with numerous small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose, lateral raceme. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. This variety is often found in bogs, wet meadows, and along stream banks."
