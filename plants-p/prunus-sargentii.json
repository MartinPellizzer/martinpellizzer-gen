    "intro": "Prunus sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, sweet-tart red or yellow fruits, which are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with finely toothed margins. It produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, typically white or pink, which precede the fruiting period. Prunus sargentii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream valleys."
