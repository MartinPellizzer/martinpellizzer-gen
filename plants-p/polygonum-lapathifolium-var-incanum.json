    "intro": "Polygonum lapathifolium var. incanum, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, whitish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
