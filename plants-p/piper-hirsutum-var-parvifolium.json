    "intro": "Piper hirsutum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy, and slightly hairy leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Piper hirsutum. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible leaves used in traditional cuisine. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
