    "intro": "Polypodium podopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant typically grows in humid environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks, where it can thrive in partial shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, nutrient-rich substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
