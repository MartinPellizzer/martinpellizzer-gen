    "intro": "Pouteria campechiana var. salicifolia, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany or salicifolia pouteria, is a species native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, elongated fruits resembling beans. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
