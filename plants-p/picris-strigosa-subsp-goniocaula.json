    "intro": "Picris strigosa subsp. goniocaula, commonly known as the hairy tansy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
