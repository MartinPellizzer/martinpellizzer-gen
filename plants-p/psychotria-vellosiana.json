    "intro": "Psychotria vellosiana, commonly known as the \"vellosiana\" or \"blue-eyed Mary,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species, many of which are known for their ornamental and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, with blue or violet petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a glossy surface and a slightly hairy texture. Psychotria vellosiana is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth, where it thrives in the understory of tropical ecosystems."
