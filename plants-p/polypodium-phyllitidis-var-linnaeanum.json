    "intro": "Polypodium phyllitidis var. linnaeanum, commonly known as the Linnaean fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed polypody. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This variety is notable for its historical significance in botanical classification, named in honor of Carl Linnaeus."
