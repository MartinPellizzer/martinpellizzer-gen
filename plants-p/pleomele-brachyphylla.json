    "intro": "Pleomele brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its foliage is often used in traditional Hawaiian basketry, highlighting its cultural significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
