    "intro": "Peltogyne purpurea, commonly known as the purple bloodwood, is a deciduous tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its rough, flaky bark and small, compound leaves. The tree produces distinctive purple-pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its fruits are legumes that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional Indigenous Australian cuisine. Peltogyne purpurea is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native vegetation."
