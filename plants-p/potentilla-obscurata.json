    "intro": "Potentilla obscurata, commonly known as the dark potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are relatively inconspicuous compared to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
