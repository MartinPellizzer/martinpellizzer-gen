    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. corallina, commonly known as the coral apple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the common pear. It is characterized by its striking coral-pink to red flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The foliage is typically dark green with a glossy texture, adding to its visual appeal. This cultivar is often grown for its ornamental value rather than for fruit production. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
