    "intro": "Polygonatum periballanthus, commonly known as the golden thread orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and clusters of small, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth where it can thrive in the dappled light. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, contributing to its graceful appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
