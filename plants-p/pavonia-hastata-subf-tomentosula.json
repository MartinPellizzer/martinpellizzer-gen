    "intro": "Pavonia hastata subf. tomentosula, commonly known as the fuzzy pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, woolly foliage and showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. It has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and is often found in association with other wetland species. The subspecies tomentosula is distinguished by its dense, velvety pubescence, which gives it its common name."
