    "intro": "Populus grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 inches long and have a distinctive wavy margin. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks. Populus grandifolia is valued for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
