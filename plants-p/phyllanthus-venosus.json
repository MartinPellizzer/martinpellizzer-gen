    "intro": "Phyllanthus venosus, commonly known as the veiny phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are characterized by prominent veins, giving it its common name, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Phyllanthus venosus is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
