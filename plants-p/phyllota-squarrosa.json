    "intro": "Phyllota squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Phyllota squarrosa is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
