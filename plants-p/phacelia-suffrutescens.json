    "intro": "Phacelia suffrutescens, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features opposite, hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in early spring. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Phacelia suffrutescens is adapted to arid environments and is an important nectar source for native pollinators."
