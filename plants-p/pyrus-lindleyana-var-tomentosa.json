    "intro": "Pyrus lindleyana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish pubescence covering the stems and young leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring. The fruit is a small, spherical berry that ripens to a dark red or black color, providing food for various wildlife species."
