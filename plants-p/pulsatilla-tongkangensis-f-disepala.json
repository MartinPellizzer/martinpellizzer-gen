    "intro": "Pulsatilla tongkangensis f. disepala, commonly known as the two-stamen pasqueflower, is a rare botanical variant of the pasqueflower genus. It is characterized by its distinctive two-stamen structure in its flower, which differentiates it from the typical form of the species. This plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, with a showy, cup-like structure. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
