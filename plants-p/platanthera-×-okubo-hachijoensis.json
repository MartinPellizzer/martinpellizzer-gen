    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 okubo-hachijoensis, commonly known as the Okubo-Hachijo hybrid orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically display white or pale yellow hues. The plant is a hybrid between Platanthera psycodes and Platanthera yezoensis, showcasing genetic traits from both parent species. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain forests and has specific requirements for soil and climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
