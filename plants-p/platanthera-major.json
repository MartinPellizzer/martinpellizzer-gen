    "intro": "Platanthera major, commonly known as the greater purple twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial orchid native to wetlands and meadows in North America. It features a slender, unbranched stem that typically grows to about 30-60 cm in height. The plant has a single, showy purple or violet flower that is borne on a tall, erect scape, with a distinct lip-shaped petal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Platanthera major is a rare and declining species, requiring specific wetland habitats for survival."
