    "intro": "Pereskia weberiana, commonly known as the Weber's cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help to reduce water loss in arid environments. Pereskia weberiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
