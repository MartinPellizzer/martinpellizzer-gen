    "intro": "Pentameris acinosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been used traditionally in woodworking and as a source of incense. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
