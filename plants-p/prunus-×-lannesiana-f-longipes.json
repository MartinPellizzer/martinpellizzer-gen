    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed cherry, is a unique hybrid species within the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and compact, rounded form, making it an ornamental plant favored in gardens. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark red or black fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is typically found in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soil with partial sunlight. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for agricultural use."
