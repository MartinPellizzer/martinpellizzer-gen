It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or rocky areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival. Its unique morphology and limited distribution highlight its ecological significance in Hawaiian ecosystems."
