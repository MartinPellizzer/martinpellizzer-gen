    "intro": "Proustia cuneifolia f. mendocina, commonly known as the Mendocino narrowleaf pearly everlasting, is a botanical variant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The foliage is typically covered in fine, white to pale yellow hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
