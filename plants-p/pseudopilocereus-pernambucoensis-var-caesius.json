It is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit, producing large, showy flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, opening at night to attract pollinators such as moths. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and succulent gardens."
