    "intro": "Poa trollii, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted culms and produces small, blue-green spikelets that are characteristic of the Poa genus. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Poa trollii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
