    "intro": "Phelypaea ludoviciana, commonly known as the Louisiana water fern, is a aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as swamps and marshes. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 inches long. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common among ferns. Its presence is often an indicator of clean, unpolluted water."
