    "intro": "Psathyrostachys rupestris var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce light blue to purple flowers in late spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, drought-tolerant turf."
