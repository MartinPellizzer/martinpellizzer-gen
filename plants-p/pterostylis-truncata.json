    "intro": "Pterostylis truncata, commonly known as the truncated helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, erect, helmet-shaped flower. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive truncate (cut-off) tip, giving it its common name. The orchid relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchid species."
