    "intro": "Pulsatilla halleri subsp. villosissima, commonly known as the woolly pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and its showy, yellow-centered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine environments. Its flowers are typically surrounded by a crown of bracts, and the subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting pollinators and contributing to alpine biodiversity."
