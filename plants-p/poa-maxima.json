    "intro": "Poa maxima, commonly known as the giant mountain grass, is a tall perennial grass species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Poa maxima thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
