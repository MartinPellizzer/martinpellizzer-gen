    "intro": "Polygonum antihaemorrhoidale var. riparium, commonly known as the river knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features upright stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which appear in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
