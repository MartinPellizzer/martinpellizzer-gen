    "intro": "Pteropogon chilensis var. minor, commonly known as the Chilean dwarf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it suitable for use in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
