It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long and have a distinctive blue-green color. The cones of this species are usually 5 to 10 centimeters in length and contain two-winged seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. This evergreen conifer is often found in forested areas and is valued for its timber and ecological importance."
