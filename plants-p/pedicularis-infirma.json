    "intro": "Pedicularis infirma, commonly known as the slender monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Pedicularis infirma is often found in open meadows and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
