    "intro": "Pentaraphia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf pentaraphia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
