It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
