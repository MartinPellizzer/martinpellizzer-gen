    "intro": "Polybotrya stenosemioides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own chlorophyll for partial photosynthesis. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds."
