    "intro": "Pinus cembra var. mandschurica, commonly known as the Manchurian stone pine, is a variant of the stone pine native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slow growth and conical shape, with thick, scaly bark that provides protection against harsh environmental conditions. The tree produces long, slender cones that release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needle-like leaves are typically arranged in bundles of five, and the plant is well adapted to cold climates. This variety is often found in high-altitude forests and is valued for its resilience and ornamental qualities."
