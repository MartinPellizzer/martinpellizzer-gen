    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 leptocephalus var. fujiensis, commonly known as the Japanese pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving rivers, and is often found in shallow waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Potamogeton genus. This variant is notable for its adaptability and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
