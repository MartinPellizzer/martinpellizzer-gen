    "intro": "Populus tremula var. dodeana, commonly known as the Dodeana trembling aspen, is a variant of the European aspen found in specific regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that shimmer in the wind. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique geographic distribution and ecological adaptations."
