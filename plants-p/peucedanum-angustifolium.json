It features a tall, hollow stem that is often reddish in color and covered with coarse hairs. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are narrow and deeply lobed. Its flowers are small, white to pale green, and arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It is known for its strong, aromatic scent and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
