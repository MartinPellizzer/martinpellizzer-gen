    "intro": "Panicum amphibium, commonly known as the water panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, spike-like clusters of greenish-brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically floating or submerged depending on the water level. Panicum amphibium plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
