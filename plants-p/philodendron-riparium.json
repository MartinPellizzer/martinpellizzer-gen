    "intro": "Philodendron riparium, commonly known as the water shield, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant has long, slender stems that help it spread across the water, and its roots anchor it to the substrate. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and wetlands. Philodendron riparium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
