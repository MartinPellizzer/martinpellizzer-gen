    "intro": "Polypodium proliferum, commonly known as the spreading wall fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its ability to thrive on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant features fronds that are often divided into segments, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium proliferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
