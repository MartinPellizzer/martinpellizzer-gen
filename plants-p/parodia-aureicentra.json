    "intro": "Parodia aureicentra, commonly known as the golden centella, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright yellow spines that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Parodia aureicentra is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
