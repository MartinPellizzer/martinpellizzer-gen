    "intro": "Psathyrostachys lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardiness and potential for forage, it has been studied for agricultural and ecological applications."
