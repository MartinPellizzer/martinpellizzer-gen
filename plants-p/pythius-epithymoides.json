    "intro": "Pythius epithymoides, commonly known as the yellow root rot fungus, is a soil-borne pathogen that primarily affects ornamental and agricultural plants. It is characterized by its ability to produce motile zoospores, which enable it to spread through water and infect plant roots. The fungus thrives in wet, poorly drained soils and is particularly damaging to plants like geraniums and impatiens. It causes root decay and can lead to wilting and eventual plant death. Management often involves crop rotation and the use of resistant plant varieties."
