    "intro": "Pellaea nana, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, compact fern native to South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into delicate, lance-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pellaea nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
