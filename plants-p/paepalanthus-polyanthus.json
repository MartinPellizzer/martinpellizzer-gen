    "intro": "Paepalanthus polyanthus, commonly known as the red-flowered puya, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding structure at the center. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
