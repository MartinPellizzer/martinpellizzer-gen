    "intro": "Passiflora juliana, commonly known as the Julian passionflower, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a blend of blue, purple, and white petals, along with a crown of filaments. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in nutrients. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and tend to climb by means of tendrils. Passiflora juliana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
