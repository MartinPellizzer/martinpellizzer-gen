    "intro": "Platanthera stenantha subsp. omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy, greenish-white flower. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its flowers are characterized by their elongated, tubular shape and lack of distinct sepals or petals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
