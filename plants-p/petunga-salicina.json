    "intro": "Petunga salicina, commonly known as the yellow wood or yellow ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale yellow bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Petunga salicina is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional craftsmanship and as a source of medicinal compounds."
