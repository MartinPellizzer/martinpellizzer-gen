    "intro": "Parsonsia magnifolia, commonly known as the flame vine, is a striking tropical plant native to Australia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by birds and insects. The plant has slender, climbing stems that often twine around supports, and its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Parsonsia magnifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to add bold color to gardens and landscapes."
