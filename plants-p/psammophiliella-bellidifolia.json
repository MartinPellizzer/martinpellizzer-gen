    "intro": "Psammophiliella bellidifolia, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, and its stems are succulent, helping it store moisture. Psammophiliella bellidifolia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
