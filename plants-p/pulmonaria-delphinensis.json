    "intro": "Pulmonaria delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinian lungwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in distinctive white and green mottling, resembling lung tissue, hence its common name. The plant produces tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Pulmonaria delphinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators during the early growing season."
