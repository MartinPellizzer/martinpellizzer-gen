    "intro": "Physalis rydbergii, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its inflated, papery calyx that encloses the fruit. The fruit is a small, yellow-orange berry that ripens in late summer, often used in local cuisines for its tart flavor. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils and high temperatures. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in its native range."
