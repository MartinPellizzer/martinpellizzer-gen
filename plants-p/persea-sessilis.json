    "intro": "Persea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fruits that are typically round and covered in a thick, waxy coating. The fruit is edible when fully ripe, developing a sweet, honey-like flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its shade and aesthetic appeal."
