    "intro": "Poa khasiana, commonly known as the Kashmir grass, is a species of grass native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, often at elevations above 2,500 meters. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it withstand cold and high-altitude conditions. Poa khasiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna."
