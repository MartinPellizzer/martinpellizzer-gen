It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often curled or folded. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like cluster, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
