    "intro": "Philadelphus satsumi, commonly known as the Satsuma mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features simple, alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowering period is notable for its strong, sweet scent, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, red drupe that matures in late summer, containing a single seed."
