    "intro": "Pongamia, commonly known as the Indian beech, is a leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 12 to 20 leaflets. The tree produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive bean-like pods containing oily seeds. Pongamia is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems. Its seeds are also used for oil extraction, which has potential applications in biodiesel production."
