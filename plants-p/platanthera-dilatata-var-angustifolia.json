    "intro": "Platanthera dilatata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and bogs in North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically open during the early morning. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
