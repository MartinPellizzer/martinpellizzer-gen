    "intro": "Potentilla polyphylla var. miranda, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flowers and compact growth form."
