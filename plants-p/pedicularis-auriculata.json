It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitats."
