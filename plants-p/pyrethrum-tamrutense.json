    "intro": "Pyrethrum tamrutense, commonly known as the Moroccan pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrin, a potent insecticide. Pyrethrum tamrutense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its ecological benefits in pest control."
