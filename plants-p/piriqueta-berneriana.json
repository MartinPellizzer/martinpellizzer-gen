    "intro": "Piriqueta berneriana, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a light yellow or golden hue. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
