    "intro": "Portulaca stellata, commonly known as star moss or starflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its fleshy leaves store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Portulaca stellata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
