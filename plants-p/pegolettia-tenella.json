    "intro": "Pegolettia tenella, commonly known as the dwarf pegolettia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features compact, dense foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
