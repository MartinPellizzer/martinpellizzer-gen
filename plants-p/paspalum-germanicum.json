It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. Paspalum germanicum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
