It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, spiny fruits resembling a small, hairy melon. Its fruit is edible, though the skin and seeds are generally inedible and contain toxic compounds. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
