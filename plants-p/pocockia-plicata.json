    "intro": "Pocockia plicata, commonly known as the pleated moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its leaf-like structures that are pleated or folded, giving it its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its entire surface. Pocockia plicata is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of moist, undisturbed habitats."
