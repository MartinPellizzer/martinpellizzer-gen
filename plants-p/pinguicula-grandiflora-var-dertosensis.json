    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora var. dertosensis, commonly known as the Dertos heath sunflower, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with yellow, sunflower-like blooms that attract pollinators. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and bright light. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
