    "intro": "Plantago jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy plantain, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Argentina and Bolivia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broad, fleshy, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Plantago jujuyensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
