    "intro": "Psoralea tenuiflora var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the narrow-flowered psoralea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with rounded or obtuse leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its small, oblong seeds are often dispersed by wind, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. It is also noted for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
