    "intro": "Pulsatilla vulgaris var. serotina, commonly known as the late bloom peony or the white pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The flowers are usually pink to purple in color, with numerous stamens and a single pistil, and they emit a subtle fragrance. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
