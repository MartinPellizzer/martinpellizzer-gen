    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and flowers. This plant is a hybrid between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus \u00d7 yedoensis, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are ovate with a velvety, pubescent surface, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It blooms in early spring with clusters of white or pale pink flowers, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant."
