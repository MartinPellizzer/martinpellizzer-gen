It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces tiny, fragrant flowers that are followed by small, round berries. These berries are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
