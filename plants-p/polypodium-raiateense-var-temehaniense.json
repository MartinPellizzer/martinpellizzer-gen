    "intro": "Polypodium raiateense var. temehaniense, commonly known as the Temehani fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the tropical regions of the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to rugged terrain. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
