It typically features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a hardy species that can withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
