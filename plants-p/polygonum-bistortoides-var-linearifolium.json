    "intro": "Polygonum bistortoides var. linearifolium, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color, and it has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom in late summer. This variety is characterized by its linear leaves and is often confused with other Polygonum species due to its similar appearance."
