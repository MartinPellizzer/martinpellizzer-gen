It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, golden-yellow spore-bearing structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its fronds are leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Psittacanthus schultesii is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
