    "intro": "Polypodium mesetae, commonly known as the Andean wall fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form compact, cushion-like growths, often growing on rocky substrates. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and colonize rocky crevices effectively. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture adapted to the arid conditions of its habitat. Polypodium mesetae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
