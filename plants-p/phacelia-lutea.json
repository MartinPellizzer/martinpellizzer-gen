    "intro": "Phacelia lutea, commonly known as yellow phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Phacelia lutea is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and attract pollinators."
