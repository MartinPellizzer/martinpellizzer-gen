    "intro": "Potentilla rupicola, commonly known as the rock cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and dry soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Potentilla rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
