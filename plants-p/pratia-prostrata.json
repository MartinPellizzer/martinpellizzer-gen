    "intro": "Pratia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate pratia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
