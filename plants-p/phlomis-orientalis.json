It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring rough, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
