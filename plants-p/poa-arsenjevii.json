    "intro": "Poa arsenjevii, commonly known as the Armenian grass, is a species of perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, often found in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa arsenjevii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
