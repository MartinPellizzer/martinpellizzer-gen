    "intro": "Polygonum pallidum, commonly known as the pale knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands and streambanks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, blooming in late summer. Polygonum pallidum is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands."
