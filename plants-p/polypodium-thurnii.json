    "intro": "Polypodium thurnii, commonly known as the thurnii holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shrub-like growth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive, almost triangular shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
