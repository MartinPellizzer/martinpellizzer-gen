    "intro": "Phegopteris connexa, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a unique ability to regenerate from its crown after being cut, which contributes to its longevity. Its fronds are composed of numerous small, linear pinnae, and the plant produces spores in clusters on the undersides of its fronds. Phegopteris connexa plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
