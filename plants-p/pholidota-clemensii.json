    "intro": "Pholidota clemensii, commonly known as the African velvet tamarind, is a small, deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional uses."
