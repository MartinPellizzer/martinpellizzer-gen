It features small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
