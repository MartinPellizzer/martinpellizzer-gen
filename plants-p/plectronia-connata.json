    "intro": "Plectronia connata, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are narrow and linear. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Plectronia connata is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
