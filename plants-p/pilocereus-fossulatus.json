    "intro": "Pilocereus fossulatus, commonly known as the fissured night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. The plant's unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a popular choice for collectors and xeriscaping."
