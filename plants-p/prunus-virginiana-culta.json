    "intro": "Prunus virginiana culta, commonly known as the wild cherry or American black cherry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that turn from red to dark purple as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age."
