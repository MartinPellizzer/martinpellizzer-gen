    "intro": "Paepalanthus belizensis, commonly known as the Belize pincushion cactus, is a unique flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Belize. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, spherical stems that resemble a pincushion. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and dry forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
