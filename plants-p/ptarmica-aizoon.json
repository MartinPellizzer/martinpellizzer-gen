    "intro": "Ptarmica aizoon, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Ptarmica aizoon has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its medicinal properties have been historically noted, though it contains toxic compounds and is not recommended for use without professional guidance."
