    "intro": "Phymatodes crassinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined phymatode, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with broad, flat leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed."
