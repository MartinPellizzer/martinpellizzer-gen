    "intro": "Phoradendron membranifolium, commonly known as the membranous-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, thin, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fruits, allowing the plant to colonize new hosts. The plant's parasitic nature means it derives some of its nutrients from the host tree, while also performing photosynthesis to some extent."
