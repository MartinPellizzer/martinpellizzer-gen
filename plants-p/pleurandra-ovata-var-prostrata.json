    "intro": "Pleurandra ovata var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate pleurandra, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its dense foliage. Its prostrate growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover or as a trailing plant in containers."
