    "intro": "Platostoma madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar flat lichen, is a unique lichen species found primarily in the tropical regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Graphidaceae and is characterized by its dense, crustose growth form on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark gray, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
