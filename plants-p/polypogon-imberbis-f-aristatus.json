    "intro": "Polypogon imberbis f. aristatus, commonly known as the tufted sandgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, tufted inflorescence, which gives it its common name."
