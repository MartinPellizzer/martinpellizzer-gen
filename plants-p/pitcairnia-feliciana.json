    "intro": "Pitcairnia feliciana, commonly known as the velvet leaf or the pink pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, pinkish-red leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and store water. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Pitcairnia feliciana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
