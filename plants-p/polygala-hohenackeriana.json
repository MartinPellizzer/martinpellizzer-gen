    "intro": "Polygala hohenackeriana, commonly known as the Hohenacker's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, spiny pods that contain tiny seeds, typical of the Polygala genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
