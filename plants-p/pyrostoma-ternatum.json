    "intro": "Pyrostoma ternatum, commonly known as the lesser wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, aromatic leaves that emit a mint-like scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Pyrostoma ternatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
