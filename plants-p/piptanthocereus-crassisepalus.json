    "intro": "Piptanthocereus crassisepalus, commonly known as the thick-stemmed night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, providing minimal protection but allowing for some photosynthesis. This cactus is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan."
