    "intro": "Portulaca laruotteana, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in hot, dry environments and has adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Portulaca laruotteana is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, resilient species in harsh climates."
