    "intro": "Panicum sciurotis var. molliusculum, commonly known as the woolly panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in its native range."
