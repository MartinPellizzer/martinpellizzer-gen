    "intro": "Populus qamdoensis, commonly known as the Qamdo poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet, China. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to the rocky and well-drained soils of its habitat. It plays a significant role in stabilizing the fragile alpine ecosystems where it grows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
