    "intro": "Parietaria humifusa, commonly known as the creeping wall rocket, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found growing on walls or in rocky crevices. Its leaves contain compounds that can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
