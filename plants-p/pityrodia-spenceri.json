    "intro": "Pityrodia spenceri, commonly known as the Spence's mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in areas with high saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it is known for its ability to thrive in arid environments. Pityrodia spenceri plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates."
