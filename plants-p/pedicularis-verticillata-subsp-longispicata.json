    "intro": "Pedicularis verticillata subsp. longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined lousewort, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in mountainous areas. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and it is an important component of alpine ecosystems. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, spiculate bracts and longer floral spurs compared to other members of the species."
