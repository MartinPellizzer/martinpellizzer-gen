    "intro": "Penstemon glaber, commonly known as the nakedleaf penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are glabrous, or hairless, giving it its common name. Its showy, tubular flowers range in color from blue to purple and attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon glaber is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
