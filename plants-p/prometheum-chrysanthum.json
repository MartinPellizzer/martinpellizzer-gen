It is characterized by its vivid, flame-like yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, which help it retain moisture in its native environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, low-maintenance ornamental plants. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a standout in both wild and cultivated settings."
