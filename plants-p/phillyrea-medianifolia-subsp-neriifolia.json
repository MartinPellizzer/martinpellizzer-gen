    "intro": "Phillyrea medianifolia subsp. neriifolia, commonly known as the blackleaf Phillyrea, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, leathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Phillyrea medianifolia subsp. neriifolia is valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
