It is characterized by its distinctive papery calyx that encases the fruit, which resembles a small, inflated balloon. The plant is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit is typically orange or red when mature and is edible, though it is more commonly used in decorative arrangements. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown as an annual plant."
