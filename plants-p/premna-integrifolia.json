    "intro": "Premna integrifolia, commonly known as the Indian nettle or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a velvety texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible for some animals. Premna integrifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
