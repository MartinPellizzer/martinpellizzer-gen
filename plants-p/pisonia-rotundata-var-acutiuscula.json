    "intro": "Pisonia rotundata var. acutiuscula, commonly known as the sharp-toothed pisonia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins, and its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. It thrives in coastal and humid environments, often growing along shores or in dense undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
