    "intro": "Pteris atrovirens, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often densely packed and arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris atrovirens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
