    "intro": "Prosthechea fausta, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, wiry stems with clustered inflorescences that produce numerous small, fragrant blooms. Its leaves are typically elongated and covered in fine, soft hairs. Prosthechea fausta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
