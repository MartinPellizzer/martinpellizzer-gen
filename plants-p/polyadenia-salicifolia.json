    "intro": "Polyadenia salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf groundcherry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, willow-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange to red berries that are edible when fully mature. Its botanical features include hairy stems, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
