    "intro": "Polystichum lineare, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, linear fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
