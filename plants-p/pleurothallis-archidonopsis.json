It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant blooms that are often white or pale pink in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it is not widely commercially available."
