It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native environment. Paronychia bungei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
