    "intro": "Penstemon pennellianus, commonly known as the Pennsylvania beardtongue, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from violet to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces showy, long-lasting blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Penstemon pennellianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
