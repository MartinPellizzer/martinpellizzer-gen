    "intro": "Pilidiostigma, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Pilidiostigma species typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. These plants are adapted to withstand drought conditions, making them resilient in their native habitats."
