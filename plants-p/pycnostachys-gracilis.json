    "intro": "Pycnostachys gracilis, commonly known as the slender flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering display. However, it is relatively slow-growing and may require protection from strong winds."
