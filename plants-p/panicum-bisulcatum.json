    "intro": "Panicum bisulcatum, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with distinct, shallow longitudinal grooves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
