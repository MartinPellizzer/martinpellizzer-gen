    "intro": "Potentilla jacquemontiana, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a finely toothed margin. The golden potentilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
