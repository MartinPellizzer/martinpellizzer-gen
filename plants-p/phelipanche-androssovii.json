    "intro": "Phelipanche androssovii, commonly known as the redflower broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it grows in dry, disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops such as legumes and cereals."
