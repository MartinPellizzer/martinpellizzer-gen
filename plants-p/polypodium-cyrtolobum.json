    "intro": "Polypodium cyrtolobum, commonly known as the rock hound fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, upright frond with a distinctive, curled shape, and its leaves are covered in small, scale-like structures. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts."
