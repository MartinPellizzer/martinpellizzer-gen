    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white spruce, is a subspecies of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more narrowly elliptical compared to the typical white spruce. The foliage is dense, providing good wind resistance, and the cones are small and often pendulous. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to harsh mountainous climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
