    "intro": "Pitcairnia gutteana, commonly known as the spotted pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white or yellow spots. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
