    "intro": "Pauladolfia acetosella, commonly known as the common marsh gentian, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has slender, branching stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
