    "intro": "Primula tenuipes, commonly known as the slender primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a sought-after plant among horticultural enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat challenging species to cultivate."
