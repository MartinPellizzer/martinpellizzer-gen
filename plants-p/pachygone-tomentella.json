    "intro": "Pachygone tomentella, commonly known as the woolly pachygone, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
