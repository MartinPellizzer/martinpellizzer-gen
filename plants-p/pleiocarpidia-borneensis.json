    "intro": "Pleiocarpidia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean pleiocarpid, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces unique, fleshy fruits that contain multiple seeds, a feature that distinguishes it from many other species in its family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
