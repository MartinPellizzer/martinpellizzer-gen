    "intro": "Pneumonanthe septemfida, commonly known as the seven-leaf lungwort, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive seven-lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
