    "intro": "Pseudocherleria kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril false cherleria, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East and the northern part of Japan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are usually white or pale yellow, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pseudocherleria kurilensis is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
