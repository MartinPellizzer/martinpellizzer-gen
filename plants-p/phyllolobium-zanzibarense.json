    "intro": "Phyllolobium zanzibarense, commonly known as the Zanzibar phyllolobium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shores, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
