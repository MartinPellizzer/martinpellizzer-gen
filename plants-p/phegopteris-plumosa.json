    "intro": "Phegopteris plumosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to eastern North America. The plant features prominently branched, finely divided leaves that are covered in short, soft hairs, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides."
