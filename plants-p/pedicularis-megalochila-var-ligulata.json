    "intro": "Pedicularis megalochila var. ligulata, commonly known as the broad-lipped lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color, and its hairy, succulent stems. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. The leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
