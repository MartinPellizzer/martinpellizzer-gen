    "intro": "Parnassia palustris subsp. pseudoalpicola, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its striking white, cup-shaped flowers that resemble a crown. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is often found in association with other alpine flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of mountain ecosystems."
