    "intro": "Pleopeltis hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a lithophytic fern, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
