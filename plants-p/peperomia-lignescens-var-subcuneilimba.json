    "intro": "Peperomia lignescens var. subcuneilimba, commonly known as the Shrub Peperomia, is a compact, upright plant with thick, waxy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Its foliage is evergreen, with lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 10 inches in length. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light."
