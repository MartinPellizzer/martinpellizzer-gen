    "intro": "Pteris macroptera, commonly known as the large-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris macroptera is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in maintaining wetland habitats."
