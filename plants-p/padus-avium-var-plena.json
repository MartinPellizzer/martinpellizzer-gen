    "intro": "Padus avium var. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered whitehorn, is a cultivar of the whitehorn tree (Padus avium). It is characterized by its dense, double flowers that resemble small, clustered roses, giving it a more ornamental appearance than the typical single-flowered variety. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. Its foliage consists of oval, serrated leaves that are dark green in color. The fruit is a small, round drupe that ripens to a red or orange hue, providing food for wildlife and adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
