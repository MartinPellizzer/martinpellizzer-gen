    "intro": "Piper diffamatum var. angustius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pepper plant, is a tropical vine belonging to the Piperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, three-lobed berries that turn red when mature. Native to Southeast Asia, it is often cultivated for its peppery flavor and ornamental value. Due to its aromatic compounds, it is used in traditional medicine and as a spice in regional cuisines."
