    "intro": "Polyclados, commonly known as the common polyclad, is a type of marine flatworm found in coastal waters. It belongs to the phylum Platyhelminthes and is characterized by its soft, elongated body and lack of a true circulatory system. The plant, or more accurately, the animal, exhibits a simple body structure with a gastrovascular cavity for digestion. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, often through fragmentation. Polyclados plays a role in marine ecosystems as a prey species for various predators."
