    "intro": "Phaenopyrum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. Phaenopyrum species are typically small shrubs with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. They are known for their ornamental value and are often cultivated for their striking, ephemeral blooms."
