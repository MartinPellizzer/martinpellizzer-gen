    "intro": "Prunus fasciculata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or dwarf cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Due to its compact size and beautiful floral display, it is often used in bonsai cultivation and as a ornamental plant in temperate climates."
