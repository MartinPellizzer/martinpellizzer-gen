It is native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a mild, bitter taste. Psychotria santaremica is often found in secondary growth areas and is an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical forests."
