It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, bead-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
