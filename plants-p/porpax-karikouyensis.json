    "intro": "Porpax karikouyensis, commonly known as the Karikouy\u00e9 porpax, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of West Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Porpax karikouyensis is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
