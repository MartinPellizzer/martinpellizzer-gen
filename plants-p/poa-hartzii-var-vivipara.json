    "intro": "Poa hartzii var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass genus Poa. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. One of its notable features is the production of viviparous structures, which allow for vegetative propagation. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions."
