It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its finely branched, leafy structure. The plant exhibits a unique ability to retain moisture, which allows it to thrive in moist, rocky substrates. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Phycella corusca plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
