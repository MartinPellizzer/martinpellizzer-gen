It features large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its latex-filled stems and berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
