    "intro": "Physalis alkekengi var. anthoxantha, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or winter cherry, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red, inflated calyces that enclose the small, berry-like fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into the showy, papery husks that become prominent in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in gardens and naturalized areas. The fruits are edible when fully ripe but can be toxic if consumed raw."
