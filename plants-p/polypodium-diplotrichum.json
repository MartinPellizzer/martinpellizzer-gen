    "intro": "Polypodium diplotrichum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that produce both roots and fronds. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, feathery appearance, and they are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
