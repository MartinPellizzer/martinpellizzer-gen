    "intro": "Phlomoides hybrida, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its blue flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Phlomoides hybrida is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
