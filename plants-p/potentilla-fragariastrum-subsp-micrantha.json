    "intro": "Potentilla fragariastrum subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often hairy and adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
