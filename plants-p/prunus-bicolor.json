    "intro": "Prunus bicolor, commonly known as the Canadian white cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in the summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Prunus bicolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by Indigenous peoples for food and medicine."
