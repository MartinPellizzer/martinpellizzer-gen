    "intro": "Pithecellobium saxosum, commonly known as the rock pithecellobium, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant produces edible pods containing sweet, fleshy seeds, which are often consumed raw or cooked. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture and for erosion control."
