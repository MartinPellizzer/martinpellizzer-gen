    "intro": "Pentameris trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive trifid (three-lobed) leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Pentameris trifida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and open woods."
