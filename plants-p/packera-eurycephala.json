    "intro": "Packera eurycephala, commonly known as the broad-headed groundsel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in the summer. Packera eurycephala plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments."
