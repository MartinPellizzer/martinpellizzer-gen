    "intro": "Pteris swartziana, commonly known as the Swartz's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help in absorbing moisture from the soil. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
