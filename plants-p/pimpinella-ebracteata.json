    "intro": "Pimpinella ebracteata, commonly known as the leafless cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has no leaves on its flowering stems, giving it its common name, and its small white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences. It produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
