    "intro": "Paratrophis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent petals that give it an ethereal appearance. The plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as moths. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Paratrophis is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
