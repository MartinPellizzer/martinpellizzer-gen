    "intro": "Panmorphia grayumii, commonly known as the Grayum's panmorph, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bees. The plant has a compact, succulent-like growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water. Its flowering period typically occurs during the late summer months, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panmorphia grayumii is considered a vulnerable species."
