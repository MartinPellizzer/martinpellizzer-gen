    "intro": "Pedilonum nebularum, commonly known as the cloud-footed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, small, and often pale-colored flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil layers, and it has a short growing season. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Pedilonum nebularum is considered a vulnerable species."
