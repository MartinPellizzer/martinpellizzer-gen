    "intro": "Passiflora eminula, commonly known as the Ecuadorian passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Passiflora eminula is valued both for its ornamental beauty and for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
