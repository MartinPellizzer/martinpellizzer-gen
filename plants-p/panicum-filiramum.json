    "intro": "Panicum filiramum, commonly known as silky panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and tall, slender inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in suitable habitats."
