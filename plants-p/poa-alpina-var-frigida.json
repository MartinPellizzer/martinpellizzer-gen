    "intro": "Poa alpina var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a cold-tolerant grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silvery-blue foliage, which reflects its adaptation to harsh, arctic or alpine environments. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous areas, tundra, and rocky slopes. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in fragile ecosystems. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in cold climates."
