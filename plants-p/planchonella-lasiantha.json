    "intro": "Planchonella lasiantha, commonly known as the rough-leaved satinash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch and have a distinctive waxy coating. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellowish or orange berries. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. Planchonella lasiantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage and seasonal fruiting."
