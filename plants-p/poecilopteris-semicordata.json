    "intro": "Poecilopteris semicordata, commonly known as the semi-cordate fern, is a fossil plant from the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian periods. It is characterized by its distinctive, semi-cordate (half-heart-shaped) fronds, which are typically bipinnate with a complex venation pattern. The plant belongs to the family Pecopteridaceae and is closely related to modern ferns, though it thrived in ancient swampy environments. Its structure suggests it was a large, tree-like plant with a robust rhizome system. Poecilopteris semicordata provides important insights into the evolution of early vascular plants and the paleoenvironments of the Carboniferous period."
