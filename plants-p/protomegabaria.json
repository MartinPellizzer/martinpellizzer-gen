    "intro": "Protomegabaria, commonly known as the giant cup fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, featuring a distinctive, cup-like structure at the base. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its spores are released in abundance, contributing to its reproductive strategy in undisturbed ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Protomegabaria is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
