    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga f. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed cow-wheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its ovate, serrated leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
