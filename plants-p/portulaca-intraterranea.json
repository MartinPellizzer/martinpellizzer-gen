    "intro": "Portulaca intraterranea, commonly known as the rock purslane, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for rocky or sandy habitats. Portulaca intraterranea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
