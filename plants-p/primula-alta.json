It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. The plant features rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It is a perennial species that thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
