    "intro": "Polypodium albicans, commonly known as the white cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium albicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
