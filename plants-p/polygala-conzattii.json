    "intro": "Polygala conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate to alpine climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, with a distinctive structure that resembles a spurred petal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native range."
