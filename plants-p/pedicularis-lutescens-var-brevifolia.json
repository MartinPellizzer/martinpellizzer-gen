    "intro": "Pedicularis lutescens var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family. This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
