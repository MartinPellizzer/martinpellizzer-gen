    "intro": "Prunella reptans, commonly known as creeping self-violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Prunella reptans thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
