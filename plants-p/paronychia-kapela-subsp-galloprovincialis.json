    "intro": "Paronychia kapela subsp. galloprovincialis, commonly known as the Galloprovincial sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and thorny stems, which are adaptations to its arid and semi-arid habitats. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland sandy regions. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
