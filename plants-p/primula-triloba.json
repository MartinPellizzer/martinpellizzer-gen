    "intro": "Primula triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed primrose, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. It blooms in early spring, making it a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
