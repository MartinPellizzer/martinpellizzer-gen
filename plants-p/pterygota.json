    "intro": "Pterygota, commonly known as the winged seeds, refers to a group of plants that produce seeds with specialized structures that aid in wind dispersal. These seeds typically have feathery or wing-like appendages, which increase their surface area and allow them to travel greater distances from the parent plant. The botanical significance of Pterygota lies in their adaptation to aerial seed dispersal, a strategy that enhances their ability to colonize new areas. Examples include plants from the genus Ambrosia and various species within the Asteraceae family. This feature is a key aspect of their reproductive biology and ecological distribution."
