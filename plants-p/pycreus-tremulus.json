    "intro": "Pycreus tremulus, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that sway easily in the wind. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a finely divided, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released when the sporangia mature."
