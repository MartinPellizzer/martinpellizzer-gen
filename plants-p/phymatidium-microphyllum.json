    "intro": "Phymatidium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved phymatidium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
