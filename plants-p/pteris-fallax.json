    "intro": "Pteris fallax, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pteris fallax thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces. Its ability to tolerate a range of soil types makes it a versatile choice for horticultural applications."
