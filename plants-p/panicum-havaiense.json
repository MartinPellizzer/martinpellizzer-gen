    "intro": "Panicum havaiense, commonly known as the Hawaiian grass, is a native plant of Hawaii, characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is adapted to the tropical climate, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native insects and birds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
