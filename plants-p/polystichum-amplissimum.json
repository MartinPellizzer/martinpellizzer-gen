    "intro": "Polystichum amplissimum, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, dark green, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum amplissimum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly used in horticulture."
