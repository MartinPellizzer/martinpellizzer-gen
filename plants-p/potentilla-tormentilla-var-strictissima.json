    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. strictissima, commonly known as narrowleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in heads surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
