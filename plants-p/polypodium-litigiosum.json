    "intro": "Polypodium litigiosum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that produces both roots and fronds. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives it its common name. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green foliage."
