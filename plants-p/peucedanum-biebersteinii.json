It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or alpine environments. Peucedanum biebersteinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
