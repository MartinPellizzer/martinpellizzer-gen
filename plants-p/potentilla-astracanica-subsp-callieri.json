It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, holly-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
