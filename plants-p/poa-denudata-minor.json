    "intro": "Poa denudata minor, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, pale green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in open woodlands. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
