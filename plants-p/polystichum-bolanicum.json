    "intro": "Polystichum bolanicum, commonly known as the Bolan cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs or in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
