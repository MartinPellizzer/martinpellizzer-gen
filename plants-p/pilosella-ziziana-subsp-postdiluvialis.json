    "intro": "Pilosella ziziana subsp. postdiluvialis, commonly known as the postdiluvial hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
