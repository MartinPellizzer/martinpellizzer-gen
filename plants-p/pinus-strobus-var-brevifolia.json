    "intro": "Pinus strobus var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaf white pine, is a variant of the eastern white pine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its shorter, more compact needles compared to the typical white pine, which are often bluish-green in color. The cones of this variety are smaller and more slender, typically reaching lengths of up to 5 centimeters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
