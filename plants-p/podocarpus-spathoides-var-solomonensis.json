It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in humid, well-drained soils within mountainous habitats. It plays a significant ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
