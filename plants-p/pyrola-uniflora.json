    "intro": "Pyrola uniflora, commonly known as the white wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and a single white or pinkish flower that appears in early spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or acidic soils. Pyrola uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
