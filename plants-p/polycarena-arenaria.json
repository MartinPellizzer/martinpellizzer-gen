    "intro": "Polycarena arenaria, commonly known as the sand spiker or sand rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune systems and coastal grasslands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often arranged in spikes, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Polycarena arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity."
