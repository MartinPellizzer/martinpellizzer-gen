    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus limariensis, commonly known as the limariensis cactus, is a unique species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
