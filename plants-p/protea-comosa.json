    "intro": "Protea comosa, commonly known as the woolly protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, fluffy, white to pinkish flower heads that resemble a woolly ball, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shrubland and fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, and the plant is adapted to frequent fires, which are common in its native habitat. Protea comosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens."
