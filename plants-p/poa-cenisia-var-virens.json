    "intro": "Poa cenisia var. virens, commonly known as the green meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The variety virens is distinguished by its slightly greener hue compared to the typical form of Poa cenisia."
