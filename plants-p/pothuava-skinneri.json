    "intro": "Pothuava skinneri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pothuava, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern India. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers, which range in color from pale pink to white, bloom during the monsoon season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pothuava skinneri is considered a species of conservation concern."
