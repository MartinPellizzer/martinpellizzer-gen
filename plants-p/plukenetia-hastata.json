    "intro": "Plukenetia hastata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by specific bees. The tree's most notable feature is its elongated, woody pods that contain the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium and healthy fats. Plukenetia hastata plays a vital ecological role in its habitat, supporting a diverse array of wildlife and contributing to the rainforest's biodiversity."
