    "intro": "Poecilopteris flagellifera, commonly known as the flagellate cliff fern, is a fossil plant belonging to the order Marattiales. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant exhibits a complex venation pattern and is often found in Jurassic-aged rock layers. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are well-preserved in fossil records. Poecilopteris flagellifera provides important insights into the morphology and ecology of ancient ferns."
