    "intro": "Puccinellia tenuiflora var. mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian narrowleaf puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert-steppe habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, two-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
