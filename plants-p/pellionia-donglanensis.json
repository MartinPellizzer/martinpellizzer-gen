    "intro": "Pellionia donglanensis, commonly known as the Donglan mountain moss, is a species of flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with small greenish-white petals, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
