    "intro": "Populus luziarum, commonly known as the Luziarum poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often developing shallow fissures with age. Populus luziarum is valued for its rapid growth and is often used in reforestation projects."
