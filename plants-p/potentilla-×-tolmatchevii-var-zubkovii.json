    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 tolmatchevii var. zubkovii, commonly known as the Siberian carpet bugloss, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, sprawling stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in garden settings."
