    "intro": "Papaver dubium var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, papery flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, branching stems and finely divided, pinnatifid (lobed) leaves that give it its specific name. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
