    "intro": "Pteris deistelii, commonly known as the Deistel's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or upright. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris deistelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
