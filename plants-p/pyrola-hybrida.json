    "intro": "Pyrola hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hardwood forests of North America. It features oval, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the winter, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in shaded, moist environments. Pyrola hybrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
