    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa var. mayriana, commonly known as the Mayr's ponderosa pine, is a variant of the ponderosa pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and thick, scaly bark that provides protection against wildfires. The needles are typically longer than those of the typical ponderosa pine, and the cones are often larger and more robust. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
