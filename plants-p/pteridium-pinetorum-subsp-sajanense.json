It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its spores are dispersed via wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous ecosystems."
