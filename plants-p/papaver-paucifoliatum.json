    "intro": "Papaver paucifoliatum, commonly known as the few-leaved poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, stout stem with few leaves, which are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its capsule fruit contains numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. Papaver paucifoliatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
