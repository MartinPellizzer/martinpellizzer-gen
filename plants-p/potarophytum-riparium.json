    "intro": "Potarophytum riparium, commonly known as the riverbank spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows near water bodies, such as rivers and streams, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Potarophytum riparium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and prevent erosion."
