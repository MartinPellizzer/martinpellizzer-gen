    "intro": "Psychrogeton drabiformis, commonly known as the coldweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It possesses a compact, low-growing structure with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain heat in its cold environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and pale green, typically blooming during the short growing season. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which provide insulation against frost. Psychrogeton drabiformis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, moist climate to thrive."
