    "intro": "Polypodium riograndense, commonly known as the Rio Grande fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spores are released from clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
