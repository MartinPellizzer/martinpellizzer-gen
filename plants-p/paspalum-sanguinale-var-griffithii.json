    "intro": "Paspalum sanguinale var. griffithii, commonly known as the red paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that often appear in shades of red or purple. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in some ecological restoration projects."
