    "intro": "Patagonium parviflorum var. diffusum, commonly known as the Patagonian dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
