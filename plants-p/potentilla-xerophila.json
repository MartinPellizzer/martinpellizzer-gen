    "intro": "Potentilla xerophila, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems and leaves are adaptations to drought, allowing it to store water efficiently. Potentilla xerophila is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in environments with limited moisture."
