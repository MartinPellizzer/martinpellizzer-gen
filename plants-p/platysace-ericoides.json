    "intro": "Platysace ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
