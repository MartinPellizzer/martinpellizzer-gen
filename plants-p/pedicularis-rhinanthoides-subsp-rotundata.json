    "intro": "Pedicularis rhinanthoides subsp. rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and produces striking red or orange flowers. Its leaves are often rounded and hairy, and it blooms from June to August. The subspecies is distinguished by its rounded leaf shape and specific ecological preferences."
