    "intro": "Praravinia sablanensis, commonly known as the Sablan vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of St. Thomas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, often found in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Praravinia sablanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
