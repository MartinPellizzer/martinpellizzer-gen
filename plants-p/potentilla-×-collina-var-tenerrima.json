    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina var. tenerrima, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters of five. The plant has wiry, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
