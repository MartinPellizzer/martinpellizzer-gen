    "intro": "Pronephrium crenulatum, commonly known as the crested or curled fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a wavy or curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate. The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
