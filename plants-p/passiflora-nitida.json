    "intro": "Passiflora nitida, commonly known as the silky passionflower, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost velvety texture. The plant produces striking flowers with intricate structures, including a crown of filaments and a central cluster of stamens. Its fruit, a small, edible berry, is typically yellow or orange when ripe. Passiflora nitida is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and unique floral morphology."
