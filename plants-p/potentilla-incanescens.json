    "intro": "Potentilla incanescens, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters of five. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and rocky landscapes."
