    "intro": "Perrierangraecum liliodorum, commonly known as the blue-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking blue petals and compact, rock-dwelling growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in crevices of limestone or granite. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive violet or blue hue. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Perrierangraecum liliodorum is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
