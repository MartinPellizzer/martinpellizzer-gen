It features needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color, with a silvery white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to the Rocky Mountains and is well adapted to cold climates and well-drained soils. It produces small, cone-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural propagation. This cultivar is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
