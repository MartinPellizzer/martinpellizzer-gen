    "intro": "Pharbitis eriocalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant produces small, round, green berries that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas."
