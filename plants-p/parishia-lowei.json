    "intro": "Parishia lowei, commonly known as the lowei's parishia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, displaying a compact growth form with narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, forming a dense cluster that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parishia lowei is considered a rare and endangered species."
