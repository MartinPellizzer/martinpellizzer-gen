    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita f. ludens, commonly known as the variegated water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with striking variegation of white and green. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to wet soil or rock surfaces. The fronds are typically pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
