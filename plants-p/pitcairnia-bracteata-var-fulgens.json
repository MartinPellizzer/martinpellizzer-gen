    "intro": "Pitcairnia bracteata var. fulgens, commonly known as the flaming pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, red-orange bracts that surround its inflorescence, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
