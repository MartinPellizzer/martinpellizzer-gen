    "intro": "Plantago subantarctica, commonly known as Antarctic plantain, is a hardy perennial plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It is native to the Antarctic region and surrounding subantarctic islands, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, narrow leaves that form a dense rosette. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. Due to its resilience, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in harsh climates."
