    "intro": "Pyrus pseudoobscura, commonly known as the Pacific black cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, often grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in catkins. Its fruit is a small, edible apple-like berry that ripens in late summer. This species plays an important role in riparian ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
