    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis f. robusta, commonly known as the robust poplar, is a hybrid species belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. This variety is known for its rapid growth rate, making it suitable for windbreaks and reforestation projects. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal."
