    "intro": "Primula radicata, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, or pink. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adapting to cold climates with its short growing season. Primula radicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
