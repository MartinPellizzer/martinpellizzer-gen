    "intro": "Phillyrea medianifolia subsp. paui, commonly known as the Canary Island Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
