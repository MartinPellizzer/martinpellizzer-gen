    "intro": "Pisonia rufescens f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf pisonia, is a compact shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments. Due to its limited size and unique foliage, it is a sought-after plant in horticultural collections."
