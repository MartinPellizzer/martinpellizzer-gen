    "intro": "Pendusalpinx echinata, commonly known as the spiny pendulous lily, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its long, drooping stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. Native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels. The plant features waxy, lance-shaped leaves and is distinguished by its spiny, tubular bracts that encase the flower clusters. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
