    "intro": "Pilosocereus lanuginosus subsp. colombianus, commonly known as the Colombian woolly cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection from intense sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
