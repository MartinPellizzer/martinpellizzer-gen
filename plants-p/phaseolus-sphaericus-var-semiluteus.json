It is characterized by its spherical or nearly spherical seeds, which are typically yellow to orange in color. This variety is native to South America, particularly the Andean region, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces climbing vines with trifoliate leaves and is often cultivated for its edible seeds. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in both agricultural and horticultural contexts."
