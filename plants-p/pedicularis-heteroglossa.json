    "intro": "Pedicularis heteroglossa, commonly known as the heteroglossa lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic plants. The species is characterized by its striking red and yellow floral structures that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically basal and somewhat succulent, adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its dispersal in alpine environments."
