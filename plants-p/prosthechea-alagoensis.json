    "intro": "Prosthechea alagoensis, commonly known as the Alagoas fern, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit. The plant features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help it retain moisture. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spike. Prosthechea alagoensis is adapted to grow on trees in humid, tropical environments, where it relies on its specialized roots for nutrient absorption."
