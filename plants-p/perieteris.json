    "intro": "Perieteris, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Perieteris species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in botanical gardens and as houseplants."
