    "intro": "Pleurothallis longipetala, commonly known as the long-petalled pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
