    "intro": "Prunus hortensis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or garden cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple, edible fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty. Prunus hortensis prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
