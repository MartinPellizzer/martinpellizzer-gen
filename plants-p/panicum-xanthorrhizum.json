    "intro": "Panicum xanthorrhizum, commonly known as yellow indigo, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 3 feet tall, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is fibrous and deep, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for poor soils. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and low maintenance requirements."
