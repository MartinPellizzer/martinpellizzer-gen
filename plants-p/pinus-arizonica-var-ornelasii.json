    "intro": "Pinus arizonica var. ornelasii, commonly known as the Ornelas's Arizona pine, is a variant of the Arizona pine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant has a rugged, drought-tolerant morphology adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its cones are typically small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays a significant role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat in its native ecosystems."
