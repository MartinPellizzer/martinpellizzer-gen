The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
