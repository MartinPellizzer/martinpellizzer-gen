    "intro": "Platystele acicularis, commonly known as the needle-tipped platystele, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leafless stems and tiny, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in association with mosses and other epiphytic species. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many regions."
