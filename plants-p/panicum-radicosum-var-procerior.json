    "intro": "Panicum radicosum var. procerior, commonly known as tall panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
