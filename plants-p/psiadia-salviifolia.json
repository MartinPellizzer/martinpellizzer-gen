    "intro": "Psiadia salviifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Psiadia salviifolia is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
