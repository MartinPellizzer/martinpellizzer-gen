    "intro": "Phthirusa maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage, which are adapted to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters along the shoreline. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and bloom in late summer. Phthirusa maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
