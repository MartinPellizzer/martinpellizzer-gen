    "intro": "Palisota ombrophila, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
