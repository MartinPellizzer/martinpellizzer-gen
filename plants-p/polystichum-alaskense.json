    "intro": "Polystichum alaskense, commonly known as the Alaska woodfern, is a species of fern native to the northwestern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polystichum alaskense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
