    "intro": "Petrophile chrysotricha, commonly known as the golden-haired rock-heath, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. Its hairy leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid conditions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
