    "intro": "Plantago triantha var. uniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowering stems bear a single, erect spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist or slightly wet environments. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsules that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
