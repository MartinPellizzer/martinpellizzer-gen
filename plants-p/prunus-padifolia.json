    "intro": "Prunus padifolia, commonly known as the rock almond or desert almond, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, thick, waxy leaves, and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, hard, almond-like fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. Prunus padifolia is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate that allows it to survive in harsh environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
