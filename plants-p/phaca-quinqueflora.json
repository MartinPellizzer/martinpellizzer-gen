    "intro": "Phaca quinqueflora, commonly known as the five-flowered phaca, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the stems are often hairy. Phaca quinqueflora plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivorous insects."
