    "intro": "Psephellus czirkejensis, commonly known as the Czirkej's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
