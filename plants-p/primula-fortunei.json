    "intro": "Primula fortunei, commonly known as the Chinese primrose, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Primula fortunei is well-suited for rock gardens and shady borders due to its preference for cool, moist conditions."
