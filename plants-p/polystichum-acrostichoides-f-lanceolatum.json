    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides f. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lance-leaved wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with a rhizomatous growth system that allows for vegetative propagation."
