It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spikes at the top of the plant. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional crafts and basket weaving. Pandanus subcubicus thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove forests or near the shoreline."
