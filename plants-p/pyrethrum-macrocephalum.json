    "intro": "Pyrethrum macrocephalum, commonly known as the giant pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous fine, barbed hairs called trichomes. These trichomes contain natural insecticides known as pyrethrins, making the plant useful in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in grasslands and open areas."
