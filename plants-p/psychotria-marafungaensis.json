It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
