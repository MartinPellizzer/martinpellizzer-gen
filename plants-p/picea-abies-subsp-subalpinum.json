    "intro": "Picea abies subsp. subalpinum, commonly known as the subalpine fir, is a subspecies of the Norway spruce adapted to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. This plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe. Its cones are typically small and cylindrical, maturing within a single growing season. The subspecies exhibits a slower growth rate compared to its lowland relatives, making it a resilient species in harsh alpine conditions."
