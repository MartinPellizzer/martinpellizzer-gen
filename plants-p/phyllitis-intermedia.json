    "intro": "Phyllitis intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small, aquatic plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often found in muddy or silted water, where it can anchor itself to the substrate. Its botanical features make it an indicator species for certain aquatic environments."
