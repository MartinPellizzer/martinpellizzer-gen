    "intro": "Phemeranthus teretifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved ephemeral, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, ephemeral flowers that bloom for only a short period. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a smooth surface, and the flowers are small, usually pink or purple in color. Due to its brief flowering period, it is considered a rare and elusive species in its native habitat."
