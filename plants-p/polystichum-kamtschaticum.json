    "intro": "Polystichum kamtschaticum, commonly known as the Kamtschatic fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Russia and the Far East. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in shaded gardens."
