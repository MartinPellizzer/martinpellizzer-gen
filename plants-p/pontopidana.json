    "intro": "Pontopidana, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a rare and unique plant found primarily in coastal regions. It thrives in sandy, saline environments and is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with small, delicate leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. Due to its specialized habitat, Pontopidana is considered a vulnerable species and is of great interest to botanists studying plant adaptation."
