    "intro": "Polycarpaea robbairea var. major, commonly known as the giant African violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Africa. It features rosettes of velvety, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often speckled with silver or white markings. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
