    "intro": "Pectis multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered pectis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces numerous small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Pectis multiflora thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
