    "intro": "Plagioscyphus stelechanthus, commonly known as the spiral-sheath orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
