    "intro": "Poa glauca var. miliacea, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and turfgrass applications. It has a clumping growth pattern and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its drought tolerance and ability to form a dense sod make it a valuable ornamental and agricultural grass."
