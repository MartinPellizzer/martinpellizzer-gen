    "intro": "Plantago pseudoceratophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are clustered in dense, bract-like structures. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and waxy leaf cuticle. This species is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
