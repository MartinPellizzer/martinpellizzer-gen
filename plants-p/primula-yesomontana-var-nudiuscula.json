    "intro": "Primula yesomontana var. nudiuscula, commonly known as the naked-stemmed primrose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and pointed, often covered in a fine layer of down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
