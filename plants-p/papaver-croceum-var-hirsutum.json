    "intro": "Papaver croceum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy poppy, is a variant of the yellow poppy characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive cup-like shape, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its hairy texture provides a unique appearance and may offer some protection against herbivores. The flowers are typically followed by seed capsules that release small, dark seeds when mature."
