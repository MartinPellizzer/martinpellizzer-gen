    "intro": "Phylica pubescens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
