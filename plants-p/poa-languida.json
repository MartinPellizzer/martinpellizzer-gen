    "intro": "Poa languida, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowering heads. Poa languida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense turf."
