    "intro": "Pteris pearcei, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Pteris pearcei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
