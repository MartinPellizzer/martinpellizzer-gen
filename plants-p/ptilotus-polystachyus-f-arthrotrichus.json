It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, spiny seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and it has a tufted growth pattern with hairy leaves. This plant is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in rehabilitation of degraded lands."
