The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
