    "intro": "Polylepis tomentella subsp. incanoides, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and grayish-white bark, which provide insulation against the cold and variable climate of its habitat. The plant thrives in cloud forest ecosystems at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining local biodiversity. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it relies on insect pollination. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, this subspecies is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
