It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
