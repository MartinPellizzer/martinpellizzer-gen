    "intro": "Panicum schneckii, commonly known as Schneck's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate periodic flooding. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
