    "intro": "Podocarpus matudae var. reichei, commonly known as the Matudae reichei podocarp, is a rare evergreen conifer native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces unique, woody cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
