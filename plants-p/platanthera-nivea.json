    "intro": "Platanthera nivea, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
