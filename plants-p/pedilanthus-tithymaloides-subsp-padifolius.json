    "intro": "Pedilanthus tithymaloides subsp. padifolius, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a unique, waxy, reddish fruit that contains a single, hard-seeded capsule. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
