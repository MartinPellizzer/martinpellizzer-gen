    "intro": "Polypodium quercicans, commonly known as the oak fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that is native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, releasing spores for reproduction."
