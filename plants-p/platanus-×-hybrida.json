    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and the Oriental sycamore (Platanus orientalis). It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark that peels in a papery manner, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. It is a fast-growing, deciduous tree that thrives in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. The London plane tree is widely planted as an ornamental and for its shade-providing capabilities in cities."
