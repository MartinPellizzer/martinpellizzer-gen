    "intro": "Pandanus zamboangensis, commonly known as the Zamboanga pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the Philippines, particularly the Zamboanga Peninsula, and thrives in coastal and mangrove environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typically yellow or orange in color. The Zamboanga pandanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
