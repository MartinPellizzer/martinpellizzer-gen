    "intro": "Picea vulgaris var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the Colorado blue spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and striking blue-gray needles that give it a unique appearance. The foliage is typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard white spruce, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is adapted to colder climates and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. It produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typical of many spruce species."
