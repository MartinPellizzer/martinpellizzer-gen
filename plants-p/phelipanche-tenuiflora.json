    "intro": "Phelipanche tenuiflora, commonly known as the slenderflower morning glory, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, oblong fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
