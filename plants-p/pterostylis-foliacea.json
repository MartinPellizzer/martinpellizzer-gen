    "intro": "Pterostylis foliacea, commonly known as the leafy sun-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, leafy stem with a single, showy greenish-yellow flower. Its morphology is adapted to its environment, with the leaf-like structures aiding in photosynthesis. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
