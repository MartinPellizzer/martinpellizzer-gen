    "intro": "Polystichum longipes, commonly known as the long-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil while spreading vegetatively."
