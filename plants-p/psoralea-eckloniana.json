    "intro": "Psoralea eckloniana, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, branching stems that often grow from a woody base, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are enclosed in follicles that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Psoralea eckloniana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
