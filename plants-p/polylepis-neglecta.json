    "intro": "Polylepis neglecta, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers. Polylepis neglecta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various endemic species."
