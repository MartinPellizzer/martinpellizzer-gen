    "intro": "Parnassia yunnanensis var. longistipitata, commonly known as the Yunnan parnassia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountain meadows or forest understories. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are usually slender with a distinctive white or pale coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
