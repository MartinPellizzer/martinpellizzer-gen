    "intro": "Pituranthos denudatus, commonly known as the naked-flowered cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and reduced leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its structure consists of cylindrical stems covered in clusters of spines, with flowers emerging from the axils of the stem segments. Pituranthos denudatus is a low-growing, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils."
