    "intro": "Polypodium dubium, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock faces or in crevices, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both vegetative and reproductive shoots. Polypodium dubium is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
