    "intro": "Pleurothallis lacera, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pale green flowers. The plant is characterized by its intricate floral structure, featuring three sepals and three petals, with the lip being distinctly marked. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
