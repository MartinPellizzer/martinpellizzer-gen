    "intro": "Pulsatilla alpina f. czarnohorensis, commonly known as the Czarnohora pasqueflower, is a rare alpine plant with distinctive features. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a fine, white down, which helps to reduce water loss. This subspecies is found in specific regions of the Carpathian Mountains, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
