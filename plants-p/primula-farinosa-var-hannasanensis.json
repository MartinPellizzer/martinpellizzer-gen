    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. hannasanensis, commonly known as the Hannasan primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and oval, pointed leaves that are covered in a fine, flour-like coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
