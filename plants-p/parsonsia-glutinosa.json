    "intro": "Parsonsia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky parsnip, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in suitable habitats."
