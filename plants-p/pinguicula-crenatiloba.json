    "intro": "Pinguicula crenatiloba, commonly known as the wavy-leaf butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, wavy-lobed leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous nature, it is a popular specimen among plant enthusiasts and botanists."
