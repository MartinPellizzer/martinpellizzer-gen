    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris var. banatica, commonly known as the Banat potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Carpathian region. It features wiry, often hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
