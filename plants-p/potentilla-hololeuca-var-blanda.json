    "intro": "Potentilla hololeuca var. blanda, commonly known as the softleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features wiry, often hairy stems and small, rounded leaves that are typically a grayish-green color. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
