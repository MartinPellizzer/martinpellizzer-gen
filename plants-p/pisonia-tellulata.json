    "intro": "Pisonia tellulata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing before the leaves in the spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia tellulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, humid climates."
