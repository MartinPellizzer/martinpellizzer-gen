    "intro": "Platanthera makinoi, commonly known as the Makino's lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that resemble a cascade of hair, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, elongated spike of flowers. Platanthera makinoi is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological complexity."
