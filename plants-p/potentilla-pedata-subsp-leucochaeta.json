    "intro": "Potentilla pedata subsp. leucochaeta, commonly known as white-haired potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually hairy, giving it the common name, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh, arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
