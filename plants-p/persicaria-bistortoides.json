    "intro": "Persicaria bistortoides, commonly known as narrowleaf bistort, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshes. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Small, clustered flowers appear in late summer, producing a showy display of pinkish-purple bracts. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
