It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
