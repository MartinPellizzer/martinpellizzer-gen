    "intro": "Protarum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a rare and elusive species of liverwort. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that appear to shimmer in low light. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in damp forest floors or along streams. Its unique structure allows it to absorb moisture directly from the air, making it highly dependent on humidity. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Protarum is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
