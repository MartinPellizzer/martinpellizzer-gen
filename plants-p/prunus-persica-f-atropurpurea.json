    "intro": "Prunus persica f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple leaf peach, is a compact, ornamental variant of the peach tree. It features striking deep purple foliage that transitions to green as the season progresses. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits similar to those of the standard peach. Its unique leaf color makes it a popular choice for landscape design and ornamental gardening. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote fruiting."
