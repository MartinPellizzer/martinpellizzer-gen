    "intro": "Pyrus undulata, commonly known as the wavy-barked pear, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-textured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The tree produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin. Pyrus undulata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and ecological value."
