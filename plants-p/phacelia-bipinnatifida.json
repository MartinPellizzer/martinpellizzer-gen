    "intro": "Phacelia bipinnatifida, commonly known as the fringed phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Phacelia bipinnatifida is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
