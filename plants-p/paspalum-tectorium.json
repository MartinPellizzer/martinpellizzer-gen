    "intro": "Paspalum tectorium, commonly known as the roofgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and pastures. Paspalum tectorium is valued for its adaptability and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
