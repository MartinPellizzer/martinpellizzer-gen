    "intro": "Phleum echinatum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
