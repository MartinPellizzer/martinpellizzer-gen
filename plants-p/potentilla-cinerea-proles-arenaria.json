    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea proles arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune cinerea potentilla, is a low-growing shrub adapted to coastal and sandy environments. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or coastal grasslands. Its compact growth habit and resilience to salt spray make it an important component of stabilizing sandy habitats."
