    "intro": "Polygala cornuta, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, drought-prone environments. Its small, pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, and it is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Polygala cornuta is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous peoples for various traditional purposes."
