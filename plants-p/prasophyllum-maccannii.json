    "intro": "Prasophyllum maccannii, commonly known as the Maccann's leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in heathland and woodland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in the southeastern regions of Australia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
