    "intro": "Pterigeron liatroides var. repens, commonly known as the creeping pterigeron, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
