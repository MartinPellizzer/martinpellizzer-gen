    "intro": "Pilosella tephrochlorella, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and arctic environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Pilosella tephrochlorella is also known for its ability to colonize disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
