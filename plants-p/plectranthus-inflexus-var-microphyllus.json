    "intro": "Plectranthus inflexus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved plectranthus, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, often in shades of violet or purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
