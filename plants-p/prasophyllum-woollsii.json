    "intro": "Prasophyllum woollsii, commonly known as the Woolly Leek Orchid, is an Australian native orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that produces its flowers in late winter to early spring. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several regions of Australia."
