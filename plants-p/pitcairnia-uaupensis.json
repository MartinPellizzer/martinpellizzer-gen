It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
