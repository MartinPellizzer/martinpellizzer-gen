    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are typically longer than those of the standard Poa pratensis. This form thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
