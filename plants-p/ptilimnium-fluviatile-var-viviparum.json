    "intro": "Ptilimnium fluviatile var. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous water pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant, forming small seedlings that can be detached and establish new plants. It thrives in muddy or waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. This variant is considered a rare and specialized species, adapted to specific hydrological conditions."
