    "intro": "Pinus culminicola, commonly known as the cloud forest pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to high-altitude regions of Central America. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests where mist and humidity are constant. The tree has slender, needle-like leaves that are dark green and often grow in clusters of five. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
