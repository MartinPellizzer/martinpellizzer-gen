    "intro": "Persea fuliginosa, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically greenish-white in color and are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. The tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
