    "intro": "Paspalum pubescens, commonly known as hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum pubescens is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
