    "intro": "Phreatia alpina, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats, where it relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Phreatia alpina has adapted to cold climates and limited nutrients, making it a unique example of alpine flora. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and climate change."
