    "intro": "Poa balbisii f. prorepens, commonly known as the prostrate meadow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense ground cover. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
