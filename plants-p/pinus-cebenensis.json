    "intro": "Pinus cebenensis, commonly known as the Cebenensis pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are often pendulous, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
