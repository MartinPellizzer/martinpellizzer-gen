    "intro": "Planchonella arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem mountain apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are typically orange or yellow when ripe, with a sweet and tangy flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense rainforest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
