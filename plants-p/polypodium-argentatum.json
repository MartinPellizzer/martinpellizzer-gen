    "intro": "Polypodium argentatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive silvery underside on its fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a graceful, arching appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
