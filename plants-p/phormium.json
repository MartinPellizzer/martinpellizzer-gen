    "intro": "Phormium, commonly known as New Zealand flax, is a striking perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces tall spikes of colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, yellow, or orange, during the summer months. Phormium is highly adaptable and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its fibrous leaves have historically been used by M\u0101ori for making textiles and other crafts."
