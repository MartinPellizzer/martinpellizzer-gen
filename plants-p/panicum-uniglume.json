    "intro": "Panicum uniglume, commonly known as the single-lemma grass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture. Panicum uniglume is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
