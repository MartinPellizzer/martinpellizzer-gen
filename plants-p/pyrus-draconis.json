It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible pears that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Pyrus draconis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
