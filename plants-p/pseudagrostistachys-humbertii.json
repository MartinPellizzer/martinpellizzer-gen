    "intro": "Pseudagrostistachys humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's false grass, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
