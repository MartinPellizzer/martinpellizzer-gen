    "intro": "Psychotria pseudomicrodaphne, commonly known as the small-leafed Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by various bird species. Due to its restricted habitat and potential vulnerability to deforestation, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
