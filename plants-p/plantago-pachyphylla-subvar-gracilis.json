It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Botanically, it is notable for its robust root system and ability to tolerate arid conditions."
