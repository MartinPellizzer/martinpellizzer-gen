It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color, which are edible but often have a mild, tart flavor. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem."
