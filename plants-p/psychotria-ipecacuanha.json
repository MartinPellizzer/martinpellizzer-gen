It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. It produces berries that contain toxic compounds, including alkaloids. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely restricted due to its harmful effects."
