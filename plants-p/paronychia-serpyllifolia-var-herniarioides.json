    "intro": "Paronychia serpyllifolia var. herniarioides, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear or hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as gravelly slopes and coastal dunes. Due to its compact growth and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-tolerant nature."
