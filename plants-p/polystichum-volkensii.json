    "intro": "Polystichum volkensii, commonly known as the East African shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a shield-like appearance. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Polystichum volkensii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
