    "intro": "Petrophile squamata, commonly known as the squamate bottlebrush, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from pink to red, which are typical of the Myrtaceae family. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Petrophile squamata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
