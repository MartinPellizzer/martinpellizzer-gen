These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening. The leaves are typically alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Phyteuma species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and they thrive in full sun. The plant is also notable for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
