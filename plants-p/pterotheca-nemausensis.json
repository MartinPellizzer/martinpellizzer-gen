    "intro": "Pterotheca nemausensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pterotheca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, while its flowers are small and yellowish. Pterotheca nemausensis is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
