It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscapes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.
