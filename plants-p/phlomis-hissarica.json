    "intro": "Phlomis hissarica, commonly known as the Caucasian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features tall, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. Phlomis hissarica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or dry garden environments."
