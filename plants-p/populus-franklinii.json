    "intro": "Populus franklinii, commonly known as Franklin's poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Franklin's poplar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing stream banks."
