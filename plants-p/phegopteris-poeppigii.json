    "intro": "Phegopteris poeppigii, commonly known as the broadleaf huperzia, is a fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect fronds with a distinctive, broad, and leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Phegopteris poeppigii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
