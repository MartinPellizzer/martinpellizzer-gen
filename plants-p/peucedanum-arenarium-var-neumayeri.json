    "intro": "Peucedanum arenarium var. neumayeri, commonly known as the Neumayer's angelica, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the angelica plant. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The leaves are typically pinnate, with finely divided lobes, and the plant produces small, elongated fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is native to specific regions in Europe. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
