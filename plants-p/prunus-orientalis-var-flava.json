It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, edible fruits that are yellow or orange in color, similar to apricots. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy spring blossoms."
