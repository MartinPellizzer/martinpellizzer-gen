    "intro": "Pinellia koreana, commonly known as Korean pinellia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the family Araceae, which is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its underground tubers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Pinellia koreana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat."
