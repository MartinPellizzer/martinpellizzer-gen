    "intro": "Parasassafras, commonly known as the sweet root or wild sarsaparilla, is a woody shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic plants like cinnamon and camphor. The plant is characterized by its rough, reddish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. Its most distinctive feature is the aromatic, tuberous root system, which contains compounds similar to those found in sarsaparilla. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and has been historically used in traditional medicine."
