    "intro": "Pavetta coccinea, commonly known as the red pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Pavetta coccinea is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks."
