    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poplar, is a hybrid species within the Populus genus. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of its parent species. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along riverbanks. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is valued for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation and erosion control projects."
