    "intro": "Pyrethrum gaubae, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural insecticides, making the plant valuable in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
