    "intro": "Primula munroi, commonly known as the Munro's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
