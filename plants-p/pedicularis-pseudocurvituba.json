    "intro": "Pedicularis pseudocurvituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its reproductive success in its alpine habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
