    "intro": "Polygonum glabrum var. caribaeum, commonly known as Caribena knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean islands. It typically grows in wetland habitats and has opposite, lanceolate leaves that are smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, often in shades of pink to red. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. It is adapted to humid climates and can thrive in partial shade to full sun."
