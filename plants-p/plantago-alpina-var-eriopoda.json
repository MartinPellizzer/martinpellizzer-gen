    "intro": "Plantago alpina var. eriopoda, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
