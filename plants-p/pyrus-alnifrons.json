    "intro": "Pyrus alnifrons, commonly known as the silverleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and silvery-white undersides on its leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruit that ripens in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive silvery pubescence that gives it its common name. The tree is relatively cold-hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile addition to native plant gardens."
