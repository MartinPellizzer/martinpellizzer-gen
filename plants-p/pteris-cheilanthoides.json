    "intro": "Pteris cheilanthoides, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris cheilanthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
