    "intro": "Pleione trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined pleione, is a rare and beautiful orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its cool, humid habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
