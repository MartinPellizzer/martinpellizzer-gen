    "intro": "Pseudechinolaena perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's false echinolaena, is a rare grass species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
