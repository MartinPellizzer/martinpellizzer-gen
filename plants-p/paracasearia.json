    "intro": "Paracasearia, commonly known as the golden apple tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plants typically grow as small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, with smooth, often reddish bark. Paracasearia species are valued in horticulture for their vibrant foliage and long-lasting blooms, making them popular in ornamental gardens. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, thriving in warm, humid climates."
