    "intro": "Panicum poiretianum, commonly known as the French panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish to reddish panicles of flowers in late summer, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for dry, rocky habitats. Its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping."
