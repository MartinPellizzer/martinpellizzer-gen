    "intro": "Platanthera kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, upright stem and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of orchids. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in mossy forest floors. Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, it is considered a vulnerable species."
