    "intro": "Pleione birmanica, commonly known as the Burmese pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, making it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
