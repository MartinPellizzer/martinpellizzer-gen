    "intro": "Panicum chloroticum var. agreste, commonly known as red rice, is a grass species native to Asia and widely cultivated as a grain. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce reddish-brown grains. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and is often found in association with rice paddies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface. Due to its high nutritional value, it is used both as a food source and in traditional medicine."
