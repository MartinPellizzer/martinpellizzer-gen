    "intro": "Polystichum convolutum, commonly known as the rolling fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features dark green, leathery, and glossy fronds that are characterized by their tightly curled, compact shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while supporting its growth. The fronds unfurl gradually, creating a distinctive, mat-like appearance that helps it thrive in low-light conditions."
