    "intro": "Pieris lanceolata, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and spring blooms, though it is susceptible to pests like scale insects."
