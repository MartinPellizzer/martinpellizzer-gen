    "intro": "Polypodium rubrinerve, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with prominent red veins that contrast with its dark green coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Polypodium rubrinerve is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
