    "intro": "Pouteria gracilis, commonly known as the slender soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but smaller and less aromatic. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Pouteria gracilis is often found in moist, lowland forests and thrives in warm, humid climates."
