    "intro": "Picea likiangensis var. rubescens, commonly known as the red spruce, is a variant of the Chinese fir found primarily in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and conical shape, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged in spirals, contributing to its evergreen nature. This species plays a vital ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
