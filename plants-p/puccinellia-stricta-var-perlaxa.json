    "intro": "Puccinellia stricta var. perlaxa, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity and poor soil conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
