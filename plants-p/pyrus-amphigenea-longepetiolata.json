    "intro": "Pyrus amphigenea longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled pear, is a rare species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which are the stalks connecting the leaves to the stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits. Native to specific regions in China, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
