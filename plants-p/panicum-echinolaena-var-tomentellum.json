It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a fine, silky layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, bristly flowers, which are typically pale green to reddish in color. This plant is adapted to poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
