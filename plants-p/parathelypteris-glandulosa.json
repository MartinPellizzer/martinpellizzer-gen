    "intro": "Parathelypteris glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
