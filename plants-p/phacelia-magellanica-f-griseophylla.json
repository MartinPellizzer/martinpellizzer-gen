    "intro": "Phacelia magellanica f. griseophylla, commonly known as the gray-leafed phacelia, is a variant of the phacelia genus native to South America. It is a flowering plant characterized by its gray-green foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
