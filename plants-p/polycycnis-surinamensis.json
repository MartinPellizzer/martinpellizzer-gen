    "intro": "Polycycnis surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam cycad, is a unique cycad species native to South America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
