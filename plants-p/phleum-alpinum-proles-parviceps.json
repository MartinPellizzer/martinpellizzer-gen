    "intro": "Phleum alpinum proles parviceps, commonly known as the alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. This hardy species plays an important ecological role in mountain ecosystems by providing forage for grazing animals and habitat for various invertebrates."
