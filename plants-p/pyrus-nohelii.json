    "intro": "Pyrus nohelii, commonly known as the Hawaiian white pear, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments on the island of Maui. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are white and clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to pears. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pyrus nohelii is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
