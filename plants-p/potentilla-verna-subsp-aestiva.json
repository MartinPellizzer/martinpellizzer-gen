    "intro": "Potentilla verna subsp. aestiva, commonly known as early potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, arching stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface. This species is well adapted to moist, sandy soils and thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions."
