    "intro": "Polypodium blumei, commonly known as the Blume's sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid climates. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding substrate. Polypodium blumei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
