It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a compact growth habit with multiple flowering stems rising from a central base. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
