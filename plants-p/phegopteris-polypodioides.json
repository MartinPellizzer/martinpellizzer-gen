    "intro": "Phegopteris polypodioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Phegopteris polypodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
