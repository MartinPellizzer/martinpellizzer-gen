    "intro": "Pyrus karpatiana, commonly known as the Carpathian pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to pears but are generally less commonly cultivated. Pyrus karpatiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in forested areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is also noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
