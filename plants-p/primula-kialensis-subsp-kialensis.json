    "intro": "Primula kialensis subsp. kialensis, commonly known as the Kialensis primrose, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in East Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The leaves are broadly ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
