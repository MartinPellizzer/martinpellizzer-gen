    "intro": "Polygonum bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Polygonum bertolonii is often noted for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
