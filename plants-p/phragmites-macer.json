    "intro": "Phragmites macer, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. This plant is highly adaptable and can grow in a variety of water conditions, from freshwater to brackish environments. Its rhizomes form dense underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly and dominate wetland ecosystems. Phragmites macer plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
