    "intro": "Pyrus vandelaarii, commonly known as the Madagascar white pear, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Madagascar. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in humid, forested areas at mid to high elevations. The plant has smooth, gray bark and produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, yellowish pear-like fruit that is edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus vandelaarii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
