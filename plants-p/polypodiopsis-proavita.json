    "intro": "Polypodiopsis proavita, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The golden polypody is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
