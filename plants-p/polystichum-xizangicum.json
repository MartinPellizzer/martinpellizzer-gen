    "intro": "Polystichum xizangicum, commonly known as the Tibetan fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayan regions of China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Its fronds can grow up to 60 cm in length and are divided into numerous narrow, serrated segments. Polystichum xizangicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
