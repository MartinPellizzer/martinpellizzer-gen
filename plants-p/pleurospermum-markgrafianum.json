    "intro": "Pleurospermum markgrafianum, commonly known as the silverleaf tansy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Pleurospermum markgrafianum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and drought tolerance."
