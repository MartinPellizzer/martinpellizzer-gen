The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Phyllanthus finschii is noted for its ability to withstand drought and its role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
