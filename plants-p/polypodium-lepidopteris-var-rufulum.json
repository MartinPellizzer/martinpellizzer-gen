    "intro": "Polypodium lepidopteris var. rufulum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces multiple short, upright fronds. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
