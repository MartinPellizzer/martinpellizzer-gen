    "intro": "Pluchea virgata, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including gardens and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
