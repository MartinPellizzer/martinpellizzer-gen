    "intro": "Peperomia guttulata var. puberulenta, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to South America. It features thick, waxy, and slightly hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The leaves are typically dark green with prominent veins and may have a reddish tinge on the underside. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and minimal water requirements."
