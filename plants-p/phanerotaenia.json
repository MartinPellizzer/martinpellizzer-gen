    "intro": "Phanerotaenia, commonly known as the dayflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Commelinaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom during the day, hence the common name. Phanerotaenia species typically have strap-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. The genus includes several ornamental species that are cultivated for their attractive foliage and brief flowering period."
