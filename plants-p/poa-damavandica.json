    "intro": "Poa damavandica, commonly known as the Damavand grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Iran. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
