    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. alpina, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is a low-growing, perennial grass native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. This plant typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
