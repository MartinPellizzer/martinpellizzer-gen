    "intro": "Penstemon chionophilus, commonly known as the snow-loving penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Penstemon chionophilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in late spring to early summer."
