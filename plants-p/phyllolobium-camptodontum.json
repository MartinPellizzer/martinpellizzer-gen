    "intro": "Phyllolobium camptodontum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of local ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration."
