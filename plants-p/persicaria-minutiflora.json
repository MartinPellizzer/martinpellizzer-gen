    "intro": "Persicaria minutiflora, commonly known as dwarf smartweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It features small, pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early fall. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Persicaria minutiflora is a perennial species that spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in riparian areas."
