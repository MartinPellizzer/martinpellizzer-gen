    "intro": "Piofontia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky piofont, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine, sticky coating. Piofontia glutinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
