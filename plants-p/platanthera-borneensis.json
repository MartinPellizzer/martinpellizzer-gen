    "intro": "Platanthera borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, showy inflorescence. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in a raceme, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in primary forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
