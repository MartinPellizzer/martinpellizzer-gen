    "intro": "Phreatia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland forests or near streams. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
