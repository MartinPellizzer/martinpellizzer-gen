    "intro": "Pilea involucrata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, round leaves that resemble coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are surrounded by a modified leaf called an involucrum. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea involucrata is a popular indoor plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
