    "intro": "Polypodium silvestrii, commonly known as the forest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain attached to the plant for several years. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The fronds are usually divided into segments, giving the plant a distinctive, feathery appearance."
