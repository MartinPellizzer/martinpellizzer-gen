    "intro": "Polemannia, commonly known as the candle bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often attracting pollinators like birds and insects. They typically have small, opposite leaves and produce capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Polemannia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to grow in well-drained soils with moderate to bright light."
