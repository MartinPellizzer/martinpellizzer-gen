    "intro": "Pennisetum erubescens, commonly known as red switchgrass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to Africa. It features slender, arching stems that turn a striking red hue in the fall, making it a popular choice for landscaping. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is drought-tolerant once established. Pennisetum erubescens is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for wildlife and its use in erosion control."
