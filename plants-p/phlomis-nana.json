    "intro": "Phlomis nana, commonly known as narrowleaf mullein, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are narrow and linear in shape. The plant produces tall, spike-like flower clusters in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its fuzzy leaves and showy flowers make it an attractive addition to gardens and a valuable plant for pollinators."
