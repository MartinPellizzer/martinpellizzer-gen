    "intro": "Pantorrhynchus maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan horned lichen, is a unique lichen species found primarily in the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the family Graphidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like thallus structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. It typically grows on rock surfaces and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited moisture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
