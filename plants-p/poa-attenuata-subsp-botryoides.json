    "intro": "Poa attenuata subsp. botryoides, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage that often forms low, mat-like structures. The plant typically has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets arranged in a loose, branching pattern, giving it a distinctive, bushy appearance. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks."
