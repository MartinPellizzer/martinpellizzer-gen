    "intro": "Platanus occidentalis var. lindeniana, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark, which peels in patches to reveal a lighter, smoother layer underneath. The tree produces large, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a spherical, woody ball containing several seeds. This species is well adapted to moist soils and is often found along riverbanks and in floodplain forests."
