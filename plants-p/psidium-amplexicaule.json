    "intro": "Psidium amplexicaule, commonly known as the creeping guava, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, though it is not typically cultivated for its edibility."
