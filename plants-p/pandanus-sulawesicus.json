    "intro": "Pandanus sulawesicus, commonly known as the Sulawesi pandanus, is a species of palm native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences, followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. The plant's resilience and unique appearance make it both ecologically and culturally significant in its native region."
