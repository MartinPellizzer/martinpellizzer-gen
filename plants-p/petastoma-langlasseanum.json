    "intro": "Petastoma langlasseanum, commonly known as the Langlasse's petasite, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with greenish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
