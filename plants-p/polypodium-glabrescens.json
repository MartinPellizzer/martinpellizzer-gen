    "intro": "Polypodium glabrescens, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polypodium glabrescens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
