    "intro": "Polypodium coronopus, commonly known as the holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered in small, rounded, spore-producing structures called sorus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to the soil while also storing nutrients. The holly fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
