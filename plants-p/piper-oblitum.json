    "intro": "Piper oblitum, commonly known as the extinct pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. It was once cultivated for its peppery flavor, but it is now considered extinct in the wild. Due to its rarity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
