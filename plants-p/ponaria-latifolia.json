    "intro": "Ponaria latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf ponaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ponaria latifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
