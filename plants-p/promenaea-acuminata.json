    "intro": "Promenaea acuminata, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The leaves are bipinnate, with small, lanceolate pinnae that give it a delicate, feathery appearance."
