    "intro": "Potentilla psychrophila, commonly known as the polar potentilla, is a flowering plant that thrives in extremely cold environments. It is native to Arctic and alpine regions, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against freezing temperatures. Potentilla psychrophila plays an important role in the ecological balance of its harsh habitat by providing food for local wildlife."
