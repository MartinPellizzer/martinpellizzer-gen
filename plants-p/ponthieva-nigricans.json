    "intro": "Ponthieva nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, leathery stems and large, glossy leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in moist soil. Ponthieva nigricans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify air in indoor settings."
