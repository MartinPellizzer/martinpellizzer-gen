    "intro": "Pimpinella tenuicaulis, commonly known as slender-horned cow-wheat, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant features small, white flowers clustered in umbels, typical of the family, and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
