    "intro": "Picea abies var. obovata, commonly known as the Norwegian spruce, is a variant of the European spruce native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, obovate-shaped needles and conical crown, which give it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows in cool, moist climates and prefers well-drained soils. Its cones are pendulous and contain two-winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This variety is valued for its timber and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its hardiness and adaptability."
