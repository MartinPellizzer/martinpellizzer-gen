    "intro": "Pedicularis yalungensis, commonly known as the Yalung lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling the shape of a louse. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
