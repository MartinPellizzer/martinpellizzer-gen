    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. cinereo-ovata, commonly known as the silver-ovate blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white waxy coating. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common species in temperate climates."
