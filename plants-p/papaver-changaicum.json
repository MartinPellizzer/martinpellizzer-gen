    "intro": "Papaver changaicum, commonly known as the Changai poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and is known for its delicate, often ephemeral blooms. Its seeds are small and contain a high concentration of alkaloids, which have been studied for their medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
