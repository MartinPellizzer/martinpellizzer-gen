    "intro": "Philadelphus gordonianus var. columbianus, commonly known as the Colombian mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets and produces small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy blooms and pleasant fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
