    "intro": "Polypodium ciliolatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered with fine, hair-like structures, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
