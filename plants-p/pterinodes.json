    "intro": "Pterinodes, commonly known as false heather, are small, evergreen shrubs native to the Canary Islands. They belong to the Ericaceae family and are characterized by their compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Pterinodes thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and require full sun to partial shade. Due to their ornamental value and unique appearance, they are often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
