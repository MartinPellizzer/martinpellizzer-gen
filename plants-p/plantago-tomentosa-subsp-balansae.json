    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa subsp. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and erect, branched flowering stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks, and is well adapted to dry and sunny conditions. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a woolly texture, and the plant produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
