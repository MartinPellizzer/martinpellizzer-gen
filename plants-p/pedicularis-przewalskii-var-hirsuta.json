It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically reddish or purple, with a distinctive two-lipped structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found growing in rocky or alpine environments at high elevations."
