    "intro": "Phyllocactus belgica, commonly known as the Belgian phyllocactus, is a unique cactus species native to the humid subtropical regions of Belgium. It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like structures that are actually modified stems, a feature common in many cactus species. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often grown as a houseplant."
