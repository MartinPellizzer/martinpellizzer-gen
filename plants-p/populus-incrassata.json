    "intro": "Populus incrassata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in riparian zones, often growing along riverbanks and in moist, well-drained soils. Populus incrassata is an important species for wildlife habitat and plays a key role in stabilizing riverbanks."
