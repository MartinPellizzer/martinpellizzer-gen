    "intro": "Pteroceras decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive horned fern, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, often asymmetrical fronds that resemble the shape of a horn, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with dense, clustered roots that help anchor it in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
