    "intro": "Polyspora huongiana, commonly known as the Vietnamese orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture efficiently. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Polyspora huongiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
