It features slender, upright clumps with long, arching leaves that turn a vibrant purple-pink hue in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, silver-white plumes that add visual interest during the winter months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its feathery appearance and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
