    "intro": "Phyllodes densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like phyllodes that are typically a bright green color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Phyllodes densiflora is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
