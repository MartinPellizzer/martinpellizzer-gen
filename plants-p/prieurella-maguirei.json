It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native habitat.
