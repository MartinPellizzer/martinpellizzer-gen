    "intro": "Pycnocomon montanum, commonly known as the mountain pycnocomon, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a unique type of fruit known as a schizocarp, which splits into segments when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
