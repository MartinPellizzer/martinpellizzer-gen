It is characterized by its distinctive inflated calyces that enclose the fruit, which turns bright orange-red when mature. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that develop into the characteristic lantern-shaped fruits. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges and a hairy texture. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
