    "intro": "Populus wolfgangii, commonly known as the Mexican poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by seed capsules that release fluffy seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Populus wolfgangii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
