    "intro": "Pennisetum americanum subsp. typhoideum, commonly known as giant miscanthus, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stiff, upright stems and large, feathery plumes that appear in late summer to early fall. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping. Its rapid growth and high biomass make it a valuable species for bioenergy and erosion control."
