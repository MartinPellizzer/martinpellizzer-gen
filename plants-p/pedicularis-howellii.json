    "intro": "Pedicularis howellii, commonly known as Howell's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its distinctive flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The species is named after the botanist Charles C. Howell, who contributed significantly to the study of North American flora."
