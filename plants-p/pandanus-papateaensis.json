It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces fragrant, spadix-like inflorescences that are often used in traditional crafts. Its leaves are fibrous and have been historically used for thatching and weaving. This species is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, thriving in warm, humid climates."
