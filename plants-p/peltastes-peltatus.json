    "intro": "Peltastes peltatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
