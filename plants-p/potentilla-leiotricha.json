    "intro": "Potentilla leiotricha, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which are typically divided into five narrow lobes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Potentilla leiotricha plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
