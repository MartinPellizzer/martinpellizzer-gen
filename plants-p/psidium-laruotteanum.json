It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries similar to guavas. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is typically yellow or orange when ripe and is valued for its sweet flavor and nutritional content."
