    "intro": "Platanthera shriveri, commonly known as Shriver's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
