    "intro": "Polypodium plumula, commonly known as the small polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lyre-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium plumula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
