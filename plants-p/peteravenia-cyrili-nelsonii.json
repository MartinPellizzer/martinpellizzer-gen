    "intro": "Peteravenia cyrili-nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's pincushion, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pincushion, composed of tightly packed, woolly bracts. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
