    "intro": "Pouteria rigida, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard shell and are commercially harvested for their nutritional value. Pouteria rigida thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate to flourish. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in the rainforest ecosystem."
