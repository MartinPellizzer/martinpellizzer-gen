    "intro": "Psephellus phaeopappus, commonly known as the gray pappus sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features a distinctive grayish-white pappus, which is a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Psephellus phaeopappus thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks."
