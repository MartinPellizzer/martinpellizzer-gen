    "intro": "Pandanus spinifer, commonly known as the spiny pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, palm-like structure with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in sharp spines. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are used for thatching and weaving in traditional crafts. The spiny appearance of its leaves serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores."
