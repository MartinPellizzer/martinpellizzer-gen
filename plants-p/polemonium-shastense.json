    "intro": "Polemonium shastense, commonly known as Shasta bluebell, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are clustered in racemes and are an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
