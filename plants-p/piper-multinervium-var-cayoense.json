    "intro": "Piper multinervium var. cayoense, commonly known as the Cayo pepper, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Cayman Islands. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental and potential medicinal value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
