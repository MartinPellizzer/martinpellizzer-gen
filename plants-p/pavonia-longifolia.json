    "intro": "Pavonia longifolia, commonly known as the longflower pavonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Pavonia longifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
