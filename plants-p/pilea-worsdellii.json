    "intro": "Pilea worsdellii, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage with deep green, slightly fuzzy leaves that give it a unique texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Pilea worsdellii is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
