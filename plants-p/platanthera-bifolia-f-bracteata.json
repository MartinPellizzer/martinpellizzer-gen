    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its distinctive floral structure. It features elongated, spirally arranged flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows, often in regions with rich, humusy soil. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. This fern-like orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insect species for reproduction."
