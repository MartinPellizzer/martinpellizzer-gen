    "intro": "Phytolacca dioica var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf pokeweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and fields. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in many regions."
