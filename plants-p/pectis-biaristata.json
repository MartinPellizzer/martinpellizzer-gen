    "intro": "Pectis biaristata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily in the wind. Pectis biaristata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
