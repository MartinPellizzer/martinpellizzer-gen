    "intro": "Pedicularis przewalskii var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
