    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy candle cactus, is a compact, columnar cactus native to Argentina. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green areoles with clusters of spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
