    "intro": "Pilea umbrosa var. obesa, commonly known as the Fat Plant or Pilea obesa, is a compact, low-maintenance houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, rounded rosettes of thick, waxy, dark green leaves that give it a unique, almost sculptural appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in the center of the rosette, followed by tiny, edible berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for indoor cultivation, where it can be grown in hanging baskets or as a tabletop plant."
