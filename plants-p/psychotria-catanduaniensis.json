    "intro": "Psychotria catanduaniensis, commonly known as Catanduana psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Amazon rainforest and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a red calyx. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
