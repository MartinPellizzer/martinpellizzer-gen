    "intro": "Pteris polylepis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in wet soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
