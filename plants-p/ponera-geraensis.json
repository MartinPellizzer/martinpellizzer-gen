    "intro": "Ponera geraensis, commonly known as the Geraenian fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Gera. It is characterized by its delicate fronds, which are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Ponera geraensis is considered a critically endangered species."
