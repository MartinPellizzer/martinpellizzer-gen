    "intro": "Pinus montana var. rostrata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bristlecone pine, is a rare and resilient evergreen conifer native to the high elevations of California and northern Nevada. It is characterized by its slow growth rate, long lifespan, and distinctive reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of other pine species, and it produces small, woody cones that release seeds in the fall. This variety is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme climates."
