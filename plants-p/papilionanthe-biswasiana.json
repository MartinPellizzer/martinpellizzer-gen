    "intro": "Papilionanthe biswasiana, commonly known as the Biswas's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
