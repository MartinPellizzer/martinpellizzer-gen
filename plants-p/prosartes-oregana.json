    "intro": "Prosartes oregana, commonly known as the Pacific coast fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and Canada. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
