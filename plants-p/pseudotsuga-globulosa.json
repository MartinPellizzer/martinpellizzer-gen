    "intro": "Pseudotsuga globulosa, commonly known as the globular hemlock, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical crown and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous trees. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in high-elevation forests."
