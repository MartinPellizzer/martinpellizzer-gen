    "intro": "Polycarpon diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows close to the ground, with slender stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, which are arranged in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dryland landscapes."
