    "intro": "Pedicularis bhutanomuscoides, commonly known as the Bhutanese monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble those of orchids. The plant is typically found in alpine meadows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are often pink or purple, with a distinctive, elongated spur that houses the nectar. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
