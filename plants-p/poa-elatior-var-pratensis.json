    "intro": "Poa elatior var. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescence that matures to a golden hue. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and seasonal color changes."
