    "intro": "Platanthera blephariglottis var. blephariglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a slender, erect stem that bears a single, showy white to pale yellow flower with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, aiding in water retention. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. This species is typically found in moist, acidic soils along the edges of ponds, bogs, and marshes."
