    "intro": "Physalis limensis, commonly known as the goldenberry or Inca berry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery calyx that resembles a lantern, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a tart, sweet flavor. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, while its stems are hairy and can grow up to several feet in height. Physalis limensis is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ornamental qualities."
