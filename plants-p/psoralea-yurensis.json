    "intro": "Psoralea yurensis, commonly known as the Yurensis Psoralea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Psoralea yurensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
