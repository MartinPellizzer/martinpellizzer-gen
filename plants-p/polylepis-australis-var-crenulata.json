    "intro": "Polylepis australis var. crenulata, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and silver-gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically small, oval, and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. This species thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered vulnerable and is of significant ecological importance in its native range."
