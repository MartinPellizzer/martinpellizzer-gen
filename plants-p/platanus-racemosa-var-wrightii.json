    "intro": "Platanus racemosa var. wrightii, commonly known as the Arizona sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its distinctive, exfoliating bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, gray, and green. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing three to five seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing along riverbanks and in riparian zones. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
