    "intro": "Panzerina lanata var. argyracea, commonly known as the silver-haired panzerina, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
