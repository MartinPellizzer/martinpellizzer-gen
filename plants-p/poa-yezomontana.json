    "intro": "Poa yezomontana, commonly known as Yezomontan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and meadows. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally bluish-green in color. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, producing numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Poa yezomontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
