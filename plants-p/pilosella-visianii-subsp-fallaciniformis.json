The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
