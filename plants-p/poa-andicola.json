    "intro": "Poa andicola, commonly known as the Andicola bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in mountainous or high-altitude regions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny blue to purple flowers, which are attractive to pollinators. Poa andicola is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
