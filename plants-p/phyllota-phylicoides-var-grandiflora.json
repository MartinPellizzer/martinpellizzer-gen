    "intro": "Phyllota phylicoides var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered phyllota, is a flowering plant native to parts of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
