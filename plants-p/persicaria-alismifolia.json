    "intro": "Persicaria alismifolia, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically 5-15 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland vegetation structure."
