    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pyrola faurieiana, commonly known as Faurie's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Pyrola faurieiana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in association with coniferous trees."
