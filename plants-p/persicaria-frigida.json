    "intro": "Persicaria frigida, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Persicaria frigida thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
