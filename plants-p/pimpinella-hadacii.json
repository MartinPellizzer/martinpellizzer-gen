    "intro": "Pimpinella hadacii, commonly known as the Hadacii cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white to pale yellow flowers arranged in complex umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit known as a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Pimpinella hadacii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments."
