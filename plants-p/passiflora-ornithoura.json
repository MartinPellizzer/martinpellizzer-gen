    "intro": "Passiflora ornithoura, commonly known as the hummingbird passionflower, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Passiflora ornithoura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
