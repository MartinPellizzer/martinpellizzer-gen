    "intro": "Parietaria ocimifolia, commonly known as the wallweed or narrow-leaved pigweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Parietaria ocimifolia thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found growing along walls, roadsides, and in waste areas. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
