    "intro": "Plectronia decidua, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its botanical features make it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
