    "intro": "Polypodium loxogramme f. submarginata, commonly known as the marginate cliff fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond morphology. It features bipinnate fronds with a submarginate appearance, where the pinnae have a narrow, marginal extension. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky or cliff faces. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
