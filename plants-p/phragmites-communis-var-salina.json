    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. salina, commonly known as saltmarsh cordgrass, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal wetlands, tidal marshes, and brackish water areas where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant has long, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting hairs. It produces tall, dense clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is an important component of saltwater ecosystems and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
