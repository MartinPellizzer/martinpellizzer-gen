    "intro": "Phyla yucatana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Yucatan dwarf fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical regions of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial ferns. The plant features slender, wiry rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. Its leaves are usually green and glossy, with a subtle sheen that helps it thrive in humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
