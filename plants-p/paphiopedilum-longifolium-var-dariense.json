    "intro": "Paphiopedilum longifolium var. dariense, commonly known as the Darien lady's slipper, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple and white flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, providing a lush backdrop to its showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
