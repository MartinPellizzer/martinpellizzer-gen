    "intro": "Potamogeton pusillus var. interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often ribbon-like in shape. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically found in the water, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. This species is commonly found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams."
