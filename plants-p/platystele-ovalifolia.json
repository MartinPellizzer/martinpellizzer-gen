    "intro": "Platystele ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the humid air. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, and it produces tiny, short-lived seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Platystele ovalifolia is considered endangered and is often found in cloud forests of Central and South America."
