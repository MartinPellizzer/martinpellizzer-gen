    "intro": "Psychotria ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponapen Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Psychotria ponapensis is typically found in humid, lowland forests and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Its ecological role is not well-documented, but it likely contributes to local biodiversity and may serve as a food source for native pollinators."
