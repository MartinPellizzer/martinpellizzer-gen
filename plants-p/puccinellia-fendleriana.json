    "intro": "Puccinellia fendleriana, commonly known as the desert grass or fendler's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with limited water availability. Puccinellia fendleriana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
