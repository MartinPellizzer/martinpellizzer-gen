    "intro": "Polygala glaucoides var. glaucoides, commonly known as the glaucous milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. The flowers, which are often blue or purple, are short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
