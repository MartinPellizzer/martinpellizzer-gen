    "intro": "Pereskia spathulata, commonly known as the flat-leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Pereskia spathulata is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
