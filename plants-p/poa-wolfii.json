    "intro": "Poa wolfii, commonly known as wolf's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, dark green leaves that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa wolfii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting insect populations."
