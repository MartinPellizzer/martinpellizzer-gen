    "intro": "Polypodium rigidulum var. diversipinnae, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 30 inches in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The varietal name \"diversipinnae\" refers to the variation in the shape and arrangement of its pinnae, which can differ significantly between individual plants."
