    "intro": "Plantago rojasii, commonly known as the Rojas' plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky or arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
