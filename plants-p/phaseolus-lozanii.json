    "intro": "Phaseolus lozanii, commonly known as the Peruvian runner bean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. The plant produces edible pods that are similar in appearance to common beans but are often smaller and have a more delicate flavor. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Phaseolus lozanii is valued both for its culinary use and its role in traditional agriculture."
