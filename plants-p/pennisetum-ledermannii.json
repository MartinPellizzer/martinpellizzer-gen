It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and striking purple to pinkish foliage that adds visual interest to gardens. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Pennisetum ledermannii is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
