It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, high-altitude climate. Phlomoides tianschanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
