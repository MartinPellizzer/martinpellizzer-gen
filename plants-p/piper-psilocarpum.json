    "intro": "Piper psilocarpum, commonly known as the sacred pepper or the hallucinogenic pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and grows as a climbing vine. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is notable for containing psychoactive compounds, including tryptamines such as 5-MeO-DMT. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition and its role in traditional shamanic practices. However, it is important to note that the plant is not widely studied in modern scientific contexts."
