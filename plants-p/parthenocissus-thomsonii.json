    "intro": "Parthenocissus thomsonii, commonly known as the Boston ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are not showy but attract pollinators. Its berries are dark blue to black and contain seeds, contributing to its propagation. The vine is often used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and ability to cover walls and structures."
