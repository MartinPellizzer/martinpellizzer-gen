    "intro": "Piptatherum setosum, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing several florets. Piptatherum setosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
