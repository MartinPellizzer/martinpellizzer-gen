    "intro": "Preptanthe rosea, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that range in color from pale pink to deep rose. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to thrive. Its flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Preptanthe rosea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
