    "intro": "Ponthieva bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that bear two prominent, forward-pointing spore-producing structures, or sporangia, on each fertile leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fern's unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
