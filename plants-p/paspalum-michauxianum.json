It typically grows in wetland areas, including marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, spreading stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in loose clusters, and it produces small, three-angled seeds.
