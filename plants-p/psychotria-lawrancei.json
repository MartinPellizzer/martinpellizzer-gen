    "intro": "Psychotria lawrancei, commonly known as the Lawrence's psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and it has dark green, glossy leaves. It is often found in understory habitats of tropical forests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Psychotria lawrancei is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
