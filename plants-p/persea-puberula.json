    "intro": "Persea puberula, commonly known as the smooth-leaved avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth to the touch. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Its fruit is a small, pear-shaped berry that turns from green to yellow when ripe. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has limited commercial use compared to other avocado species."
