    "intro": "Phlegmariurus hugoi, commonly known as the Hugoi's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its clustered, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Phlegmariurus hugoi is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
