    "intro": "Peristera parvula, commonly known as the small peristera, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. Peristera parvula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
