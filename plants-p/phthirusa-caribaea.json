    "intro": "Phthirusa caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns resembling spider webs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
