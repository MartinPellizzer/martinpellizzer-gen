    "intro": "Pyrrosia sphaerosticha, commonly known as the spherical fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically short and clustered, with a distinctive, rounded shape that gives it its common name. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
