It features rounded, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, providing a dense ground cover. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which bloom on short, upright stems. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological importance. The species is adapted to acidic, shaded environments and is often found in boreal and temperate forest understories."
