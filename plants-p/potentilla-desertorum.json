    "intro": "Potentilla desertorum, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Potentilla desertorum is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
