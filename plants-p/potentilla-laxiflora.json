    "intro": "Potentilla laxiflora, commonly known as the slender flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, arching stems that bear small, yellow, five-petaled flowers clustered in terminal racemes. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
