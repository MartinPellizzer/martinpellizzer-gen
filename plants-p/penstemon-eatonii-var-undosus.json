    "intro": "Penstemon eatonii var. undosus, commonly known as the wavy beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers. The flowers are typically pink to purple in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. This plant is well-suited for rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats."
