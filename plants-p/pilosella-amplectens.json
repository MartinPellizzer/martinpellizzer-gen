    "intro": "Pilosella amplectens, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Pilosella amplectens is often found in meadows and can be an indicator plant for certain soil types."
