It has slender, branching stems that are typically found in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense spikes, and its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like. Potamogeton mizuhikimo plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. It is also used in phytoremediation to help clean water by absorbing nutrients and pollutants."
