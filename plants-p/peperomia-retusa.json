    "intro": "Peperomia retusa, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering. Peperomia retusa is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
