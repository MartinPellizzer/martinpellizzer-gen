    "intro": "Pogonia graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-pogonia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant features a slender, grass-like stem with a single, showy orchid-like flower that is usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its small size and inconspicuous appearance make it challenging to identify without close examination. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
