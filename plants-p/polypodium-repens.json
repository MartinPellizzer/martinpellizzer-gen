    "intro": "Polypodium repens, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy through spore dispersal."
