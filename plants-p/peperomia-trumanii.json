    "intro": "Peperomia trumanii, commonly known as Truman's pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with some varieties displaying variegated patterns. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked, though they are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is well-suited for container cultivation and as a tabletop plant."
