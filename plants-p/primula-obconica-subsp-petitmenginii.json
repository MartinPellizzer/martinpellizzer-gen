    "intro": "Primula obconica subsp. petitmenginii, commonly known as the Petitmengin's primrose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pyrenees region of France. It is a perennial herb with basal rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
