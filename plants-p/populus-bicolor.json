    "intro": "Populus bicolor, commonly known as the twinleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are divided into two large, lobed sections, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin layers. Populus bicolor typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
