    "intro": "Polygala alpicola, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters, and is adapted to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Polygala alpicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
