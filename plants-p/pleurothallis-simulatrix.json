It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that often resemble other orchid species, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a delicate appearance that aids in pollination by small insects. Pleurothallis simulatrix is valued in horticulture for its unique floral structure and adaptability to various growing conditions."
