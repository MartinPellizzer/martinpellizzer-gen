    "intro": "Polemonium diminutum, commonly known as the dwarf bluebell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that rise to about 15-30 cm in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and early blooming make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
