    "intro": "Platanthera henryi, commonly known as Henry's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a distinctive inflorescence of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Its morphology and flowering habits make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
