    "intro": "Pseudocoeloglossum falcilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed marsh fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
