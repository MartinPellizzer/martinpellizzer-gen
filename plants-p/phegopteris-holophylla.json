    "intro": "Phegopteris holophylla, commonly known as the evergreen water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, pointed segments called pinnae. Phegopteris holophylla is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
