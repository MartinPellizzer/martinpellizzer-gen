    "intro": "Pharnaceum pruinosum, commonly known as the sticky pharnaceum, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that emit a sticky substance, which is a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
