    "intro": "Pharbitis scabrida, commonly known as hairy nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
