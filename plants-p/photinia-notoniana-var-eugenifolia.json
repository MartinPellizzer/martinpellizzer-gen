    "intro": "Photinia notoniana var. eugenifolia, commonly known as the silver-leaf photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking silver-white to grayish foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptical in shape, and have a velvety texture. It produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
