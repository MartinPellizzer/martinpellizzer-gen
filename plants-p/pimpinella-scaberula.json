    "intro": "Pimpinella scaberula, commonly known as roughhedge parsley, is a small biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small and oval, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties. Pimpinella scaberula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
