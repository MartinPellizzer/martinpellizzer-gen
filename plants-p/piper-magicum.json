    "intro": "Piper magicum, commonly known as the magical pepper, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when ripe, containing a spicy compound similar to capsaicin. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. However, due to its rarity and limited cultivation, it remains a subject of scientific interest rather than widespread use."
