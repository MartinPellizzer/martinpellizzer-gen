    "intro": "Prunus reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically reddish when young. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental landscaping. Prunus reflexa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its delicate foliage and seasonal interest."
