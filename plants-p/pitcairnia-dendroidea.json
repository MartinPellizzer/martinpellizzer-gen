    "intro": "Pitcairnia dendroidea, commonly known as the tree pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces striking inflorescences with long, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
