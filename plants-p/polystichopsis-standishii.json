    "intro": "Polystichopsis standishii, commonly known as the standish's holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and prefers cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat. Polystichopsis standishii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
