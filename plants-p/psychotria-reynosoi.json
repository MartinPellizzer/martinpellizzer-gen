    "intro": "Psychotria reynosoi, commonly known as the Ecuadorian Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of western Ecuador and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in understory habitats, thriving in the shade of taller trees. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
