    "intro": "Phreatia sarawaketensis, commonly known as the Sarawak orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
