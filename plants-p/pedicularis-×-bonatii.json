    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 bonatii, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a hybrid plant belonging to the genus Pedicularis in the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble small monkeys, hence its common name. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a notable ornamental and ecological subject in botanical studies."
