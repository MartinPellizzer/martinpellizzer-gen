    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. erythrodes, commonly known as the redstem cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features slender, hairy stems that turn reddish in color as they mature. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval-shaped lobes, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it well adapted to its natural habitat and suitable for cultivation in similar conditions."
