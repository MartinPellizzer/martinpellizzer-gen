    "intro": "Paypayrola panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian paypayrola, is a flowering plant native to Central America, specifically Panama. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
