    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subvar. longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, covered in silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white pubescence. This subspecies is often found in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in meadows."
