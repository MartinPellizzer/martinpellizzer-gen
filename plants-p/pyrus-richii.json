    "intro": "Pyrus richii, commonly known as the Richii pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps. The plant is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are alternate and ovate with serrated edges. It produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically small and yellowish-green in color. The Richii pear is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in horticulture due to its specific growing requirements."
