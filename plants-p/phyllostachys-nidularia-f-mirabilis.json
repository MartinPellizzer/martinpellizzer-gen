    "intro": "Phyllostachys nidularia f. mirabilis, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a unique form of the bamboo species Phyllostachys nidularia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms that contrast vividly with its green leaves. This ornamental bamboo is native to China and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It grows as a clump-forming plant, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, and is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is an ideal choice for smaller spaces and container gardening."
