    "intro": "Psychotria oblita, commonly known as the \"Cocaine Plant\" or \"Coca Plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly the Andean regions of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It contains alkaloids, including cocaine, which make it significant in both medicinal and illicit contexts. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research."
