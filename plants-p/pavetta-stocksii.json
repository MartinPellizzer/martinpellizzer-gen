It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has simple, opposite, and often glandular-stipulate leaves. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and are usually white or pale pink, with five petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses."
