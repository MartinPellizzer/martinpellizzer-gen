It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically sword-shaped and arranged in a rosette, forming a central pool that can collect rainwater.
