    "intro": "Pseudomacodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its slender, delicate stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Pseudomacodes thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
