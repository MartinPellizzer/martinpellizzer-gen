It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often feathery and arranged in a pinnate pattern. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
