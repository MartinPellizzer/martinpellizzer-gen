    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis dasilvae, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a species native to the humid, montane regions of Central and South America. This epiphytic orchid typically grows on trees in the understory of dense tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the cool, moist environment. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its natural habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Pleurothallis dasilvae is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
