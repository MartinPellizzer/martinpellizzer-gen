    "intro": "Pleopeltis bradei, commonly known as the Brade's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate, while its leaves are usually divided into narrow, linear segments. Pleopeltis bradei is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
