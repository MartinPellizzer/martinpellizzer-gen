    "intro": "Pachypleurum gayoides, commonly known as the rock fig, is a tropical shrub native to the islands of the South Pacific. It is characterized by its woody, sprawling stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, where it is often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
