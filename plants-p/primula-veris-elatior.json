    "intro": "Primula veris elatior, commonly known as the greater cowslip, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The greater cowslip is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in herbal medicine."
