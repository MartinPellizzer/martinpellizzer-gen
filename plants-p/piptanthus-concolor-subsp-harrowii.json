    "intro": "Piptanthus concolor subsp. harrowii, commonly known as the Harrow's leafy broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, elongated pods containing seeds. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaping and arid garden settings."
