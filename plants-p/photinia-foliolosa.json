    "intro": "Photinia foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for hedges or specimen plants in landscaped areas."
