    "intro": "Pulmonaria kerneri, commonly known as the Alpine lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features basal rosettes of velvety, spotted leaves that are typically green with purple or pink markings. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Pulmonaria kerneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
