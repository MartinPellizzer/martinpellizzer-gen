    "intro": "Poa subenervis var. spegazziniana, commonly known as the Spegazzinian meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to reddish in color. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf venation compared to the typical form of Poa subenervis."
