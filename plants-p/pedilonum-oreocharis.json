    "intro": "Pedilonum oreocharis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Pedilonum oreocharis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
