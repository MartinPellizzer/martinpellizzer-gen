    "intro": "Primula meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its alpine habitat. It prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and partial to full shade. Primula meyeri is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
