    "intro": "Phlegmariurus robustus, commonly known as the robust clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Phlegmariurus robustus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
