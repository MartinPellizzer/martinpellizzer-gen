It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and ability to climb or trail, often used in landscaping. It is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for native pollinators."
