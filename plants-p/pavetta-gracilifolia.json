    "intro": "Pavetta gracilifolia, commonly known as slender-leaved pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Pavetta gracilifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
