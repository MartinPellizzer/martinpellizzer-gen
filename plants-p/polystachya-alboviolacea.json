    "intro": "Polystachya alboviolacea, commonly known as the white-violet orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale violet to white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a key feature in orchid classification. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
