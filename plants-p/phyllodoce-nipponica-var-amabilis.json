    "intro": "Phyllodoce nipponica var. amabilis, commonly known as the Japanese mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas."
