    "intro": "Pappophorum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) stems that typically reach heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in delicate, feathery structures called pappi. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. Pappophorum fasciculatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
