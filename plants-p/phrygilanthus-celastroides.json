It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters.

The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
