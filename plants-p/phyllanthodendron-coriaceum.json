    "intro": "Phyllanthodendron coriaceum, commonly known as the hard-leaved phyllanthodendron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that provide protection against excessive moisture and light. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
