    "intro": "Pachycarpus campanulatus var. sutherlandii, commonly known as the Sutherland's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
