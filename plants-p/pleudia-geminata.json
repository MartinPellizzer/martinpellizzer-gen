    "intro": "Pleudia geminata, commonly known as the twin-leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that often grow in pairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, Pleudia geminata is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
