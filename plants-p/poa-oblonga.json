    "intro": "Poa oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa oblonga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense turf."
