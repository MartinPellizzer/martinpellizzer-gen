    "intro": "Psilotrichum peterianum, commonly known as the Peter's spike moss, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
