    "intro": "Pedicularis cernua var. typica, commonly known as the nodding lungwort, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of wrinkled, greenish-gray leaves and its showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bumblebees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological interest."
