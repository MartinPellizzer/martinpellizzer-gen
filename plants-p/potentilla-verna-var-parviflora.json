    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. parviflora, commonly known as the spring potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, deciduous leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which bloom before its leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
