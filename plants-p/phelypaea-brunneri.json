    "intro": "Phelypaea brunneri, commonly known as the Brunner's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water's surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Phelypaea brunneri plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
