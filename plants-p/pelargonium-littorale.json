    "intro": "Pelargonium littorale, commonly known as the coastal geranium, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Pelargonium littorale is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to salt spray."
