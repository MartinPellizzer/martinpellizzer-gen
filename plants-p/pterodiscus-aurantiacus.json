    "intro": "Pterodiscus aurantiacus, commonly known as the golden disc fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow fronds that resemble small discs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
