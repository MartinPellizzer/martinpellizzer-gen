    "intro": "Pachycereus schottii f. sargentianus, commonly known as the Sargent's prickly pear, is a columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height, adapted to store water in its succulent tissues. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. The fruit, which is a red, fleshy berry, contains seeds and is an important food source for local wildlife."
