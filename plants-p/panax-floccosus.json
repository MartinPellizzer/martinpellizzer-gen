    "intro": "Panax floccosus, commonly known as the white ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, fluffy white root system, which differs significantly from the typical red or yellow roots of other ginseng species. Native to the mountainous regions of China, it thrives in cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant's botanical features include compound leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its rarity and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
