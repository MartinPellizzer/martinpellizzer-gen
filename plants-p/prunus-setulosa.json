    "intro": "Prunus setulosa, commonly known as the Chinese flowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it a unique texture. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Prunus setulosa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine."
