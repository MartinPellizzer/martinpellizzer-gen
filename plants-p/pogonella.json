    "intro": "Pogonella, commonly known as the spiky moss or beard moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Pogonellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky appearance, with leaf-like structures that have a sharp, toothed margin. Pogonella species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil surfaces in temperate regions. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often overlooked, as the plant reproduces primarily through spores."
