    "intro": "Potentilla curviseta var. colletiana, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
