    "intro": "Pyrus stankovii, commonly known as the Stankovi\u0107 pear, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, ornamental leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible pears that are typically harvested in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus stankovii is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
