    "intro": "Premna ambongensis, commonly known as the Bornean premna, is a flowering plant species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. It is often found growing in moist, shaded environments within the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
