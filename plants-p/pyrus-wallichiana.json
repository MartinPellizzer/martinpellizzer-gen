    "intro": "Pyrus wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan white pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, yellowish fruits. It prefers cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
