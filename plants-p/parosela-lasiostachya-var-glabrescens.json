It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow to orange composite flowers arranged in dense, disc-like clusters. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
