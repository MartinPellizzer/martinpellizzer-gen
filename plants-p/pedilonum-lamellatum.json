    "intro": "Pedilonum lamellatum, commonly known as the crested or spotted orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, crested or wavy leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the rainy season. Pedilonum lamellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
