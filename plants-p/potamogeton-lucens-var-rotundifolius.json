It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, rounded leaves arranged in whorls. The leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water resistance. This plant plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. It is often found in shallow lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams."
