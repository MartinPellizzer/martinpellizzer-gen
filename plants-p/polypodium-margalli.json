    "intro": "Polypodium margalli, commonly known as the marginal huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps anchor it to rocky or shaded habitats. Polypodium margalli is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
