    "intro": "Prunus spinosa monstr. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered blackthorn, is a cultivar of the blackthorn plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The flowers are double, meaning they have more petals than the typical single-flowered variety, giving them a more ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in late summer, which are edible but often used in jams and preserves. It is often grown as a hedge or ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
