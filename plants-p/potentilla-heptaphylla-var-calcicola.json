    "intro": "Potentilla heptaphylla var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola potentilla, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
