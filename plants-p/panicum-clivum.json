    "intro": "Panicum clivum, commonly known as the cliff panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to rocky or disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun. Due to its resilience and low water requirements, it is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
