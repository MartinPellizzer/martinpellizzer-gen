    "intro": "Pulsatilla pratensis var. monstrosa, commonly known as the giant pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces a distinctive, woolly crown of leaves that are often lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
