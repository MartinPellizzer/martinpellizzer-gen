    "intro": "Panicum frappieri, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Panicum frappieri plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
