    "intro": "Polystichum balansae, commonly known as the Balansae sword fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Polystichum balansae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
