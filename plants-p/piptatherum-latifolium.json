It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, upright stems and broad, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. Piptatherum latifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
