It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
