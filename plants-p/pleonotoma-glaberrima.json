It is characterized by its elongated, slender shell that is typically smooth and lacks prominent sculpturing. The shell is usually pale in color, often with a slight iridescence, and can reach lengths of up to 2 centimeters. This species is typically found in freshwater environments such as streams and rivers with moderate to fast-flowing water. Its diet consists mainly of detritus and algae, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula."
