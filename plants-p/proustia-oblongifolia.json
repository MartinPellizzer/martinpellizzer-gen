    "intro": "Proustia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved proustia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, oblong leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice among gardeners interested in low-maintenance, native plants."
