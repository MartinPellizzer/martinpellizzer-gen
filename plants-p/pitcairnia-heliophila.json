    "intro": "Pitcairnia heliophila, commonly known as the sun pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height, featuring vibrant red bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky or open areas, thriving in full sun exposure. Its rosette-shaped leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Pitcairnia heliophila is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens."
