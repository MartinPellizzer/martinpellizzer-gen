It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of elliptical to ovate leaves, which are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some island cultures."
