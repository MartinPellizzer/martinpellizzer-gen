    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris var. taiwaniana, commonly known as Taiwan selfheal, is a perennial herb native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished from the more widespread Prunella vulgaris by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different floral structure."
