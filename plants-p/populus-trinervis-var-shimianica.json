    "intro": "Populus trinervis var. shimianica, commonly known as the Shimian poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to southwestern China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are finely divided into three narrow lobes. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by oval-shaped seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
