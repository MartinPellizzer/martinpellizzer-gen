    "intro": "Pleurothallis obscura, commonly known as the dark pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, narrow leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually short-lived and are pollinated by small insects such as flies and beetles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
