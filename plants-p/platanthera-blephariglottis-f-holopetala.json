    "intro": "Platanthera blephariglottis f. holopetala, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a rare orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure. It features a single, showy white flower with a distinctive hooded labellum, which is a specialized petal structure typical of orchids. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological adaptations and ecological role in its native habitat."
