    "intro": "Phlegmariurus chiricanus, commonly known as the Peruvian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, evergreen, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces sporophylls that enclose the microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of lycophytes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures are essential for its propagation and ecological role in its native habitat."
