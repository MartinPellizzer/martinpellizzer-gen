    "intro": "Poa okuyamae, commonly known as the Okuyama bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Japan. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant typically reaches a height of 10\u201320 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa okuyamae is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
