    "intro": "Petasites radiatus, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with petal-like structures arranged in a star shape, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
