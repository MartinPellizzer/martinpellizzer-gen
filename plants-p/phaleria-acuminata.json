    "intro": "Phaleria acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The tree produces small, dark brown fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Phaleria acuminata is now considered an endangered species."
