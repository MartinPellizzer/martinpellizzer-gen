    "intro": "Pedicularis langsdorffii subsp. langsdorffii, commonly known as the Langsdorff's lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, thriving in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. This subspecies is native to parts of Asia, including regions of Russia and the Himalayas."
