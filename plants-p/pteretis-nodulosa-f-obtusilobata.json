    "intro": "Pteretis nodulosa f. obtusilobata, commonly known as the blunt-lobed pteretis, is a unique variant of the pteretis genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaf lobes that differ from the typical shape of the species. The plant is a perennial herb native to specific regions in New Zealand, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
