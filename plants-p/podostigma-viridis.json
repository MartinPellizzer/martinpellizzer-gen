    "intro": "Podostigma viridis, commonly known as the green podostigma, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized reproductive structures. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found along the margins of ponds and streams. The plant's most distinctive feature is its podostigma, a modified stigma that serves as a landing platform for pollinating insects. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water flow. Podostigma viridis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
