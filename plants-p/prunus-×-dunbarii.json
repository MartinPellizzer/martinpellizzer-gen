    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 dunbarii, commonly known as the Dunbar cherry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus avium (sweet cherry) and Prunus padus (sour cherry). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark red to black berries in late summer. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and preserves. Prunus \u00d7 dunbarii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
