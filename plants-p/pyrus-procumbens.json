    "intro": "Pyrus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping pear, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or sprawling growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy surface and serrated margins. Pyrus procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in rocky soils."
