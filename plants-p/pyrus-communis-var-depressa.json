    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf common pear, is a compact, ornamental variety of the common pear tree. It features a rounded, bushy growth habit with small, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet fruit. It is typically smaller than the standard common pear, making it suitable for small gardens or container growing. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
