    "intro": "Piper articulosum, commonly known as the creeping pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant features thin, wiry stems that can trail along the ground or climb supports, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often slightly hairy. Small greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, followed by small, three-lobed berries that turn red when mature. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
