    "intro": "Pyrostria salicifolia, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a silky texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
