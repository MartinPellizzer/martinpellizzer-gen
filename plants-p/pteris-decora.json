    "intro": "Pteris decora, commonly known as the decorative water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near water sources such as streams or ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. Pteris decora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
