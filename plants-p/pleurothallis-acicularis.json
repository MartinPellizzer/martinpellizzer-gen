It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. It is characterized by its unique morphology, with a narrow, needle-like shape that gives it its common name. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
