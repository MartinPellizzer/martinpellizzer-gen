    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 regenerata, commonly known as the hybrid aspen, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen) and Populus balsamifera (balsam poplar). The plant is characterized by its smooth, white bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. Populus \u00d7 regenerata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
