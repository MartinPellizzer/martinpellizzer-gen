    "intro": "Pinus interposita, commonly known as the Sitka white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its long, soft needles that are typically bundled in groups of five. The tree produces large, cone-like structures that contain seeds covered in a thin, winged membrane. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in areas with high rainfall. Its wood is valued for its strength and is used in construction and furniture-making."
