    "intro": "Platanthera gerrardii, commonly known as the Gerrard's lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a distinctive, fragrant inflorescence of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, wet pine forests, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Platanthera gerrardii is an indicator species for wetland habitats and is often found in association with other rare orchid species."
