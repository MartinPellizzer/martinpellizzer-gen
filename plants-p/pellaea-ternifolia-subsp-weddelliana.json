    "intro": "Pellaea ternifolia subsp. weddelliana, commonly known as the Weddell's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
