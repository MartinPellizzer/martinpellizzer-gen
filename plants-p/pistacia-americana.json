    "intro": "Pistacia americana, commonly known as the eastern pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, and its distinctive yellowish-green to reddish flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are encased in a hard, spiny husk. These fruits contain a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Pistacia americana is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in woodland edges and open forests."
