    "intro": "Peperomia rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are borne in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia rufescens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
