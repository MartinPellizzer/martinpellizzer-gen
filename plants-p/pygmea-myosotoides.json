    "intro": "Pygmea myosotoides, commonly known as the dwarf forget-me-not, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to conserve moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in horticultural settings."
