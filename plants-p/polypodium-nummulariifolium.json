    "intro": "Polypodium nummulariifolium, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of shield-shaped, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized covering called an indusium."
