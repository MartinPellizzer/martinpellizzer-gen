    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Pseudoroegneria geniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its dense growth and drought tolerance."
