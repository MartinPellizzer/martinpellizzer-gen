    "intro": "Panicum glumare, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bract-like glumes, which give it its scientific name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, sandpapery texture along the edges. Panicum glumare is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to a range of environmental conditions."
