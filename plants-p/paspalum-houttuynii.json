    "intro": "Paspalum houttuynii, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Paspalum houttuynii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
