    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. coronata, commonly known as the flowering blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible but tart fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedgerow management."
