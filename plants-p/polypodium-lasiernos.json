    "intro": "Polypodium lasiernos, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a rugged appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, often forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil in its natural habitat. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a typical feature of ferns."
