    "intro": "Pedicularis sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan Beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
