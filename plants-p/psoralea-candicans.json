    "intro": "Psoralea candicans, commonly known as the shining psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers that are typically pea-shaped, a common feature in the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means. Psoralea candicans is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, adapting well to arid and semi-arid environments."
