    "intro": "Protea parilis, commonly known as the Cape rose, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble roses, with intricate, layered bracts and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted to its nectar. Protea parilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and longevity."
