    "intro": "Phragmites communis subsp. hispanicus, commonly known as the European common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and dense, feather-like leaves. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to various regions worldwide. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for wildlife. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly and dominate wetland ecosystems."
