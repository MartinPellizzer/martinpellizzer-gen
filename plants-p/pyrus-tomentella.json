    "intro": "Pyrus tomentella, commonly known as the woolly apple tree, is a small, deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round apples that are typically not suitable for eating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Pyrus tomentella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
