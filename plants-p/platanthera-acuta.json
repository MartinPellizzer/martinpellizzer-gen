    "intro": "Platanthera acuta, commonly known as the acute lady's-tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that bears a dense, dark green to brownish spike of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are small, tubular, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the inflorescence. Platanthera acuta relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids."
