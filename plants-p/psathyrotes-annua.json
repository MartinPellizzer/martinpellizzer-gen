    "intro": "Psathyrotes annua, commonly known as the annual false nettle, is an herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered fruits that are dispersed by wind. Psathyrotes annua is an annual plant, meaning it completes its life cycle within one growing season."
