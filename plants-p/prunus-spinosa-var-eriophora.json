    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. eriophora, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in hedgerows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant white flowers in early spring. The berries are used in culinary applications and traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
