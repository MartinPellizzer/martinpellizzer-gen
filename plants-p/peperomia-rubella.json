    "intro": "Peperomia rubella, commonly known as the red peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features small, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically red or reddish-purple on the underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and drought tolerance. Peperomia rubella is often grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
