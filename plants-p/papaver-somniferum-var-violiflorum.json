    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. violiflorum, commonly known as the Persian poppy, is a cultivated variant of the opium poppy. It is characterized by its striking violet or deep blue flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often grown for its ornamental value. Its flowers are typically larger and more showy compared to the wild type, making it a popular choice in gardens. However, it is important to note that the plant has a historical association with the production of opium, though modern cultivation of this variety is primarily for horticultural purposes."
