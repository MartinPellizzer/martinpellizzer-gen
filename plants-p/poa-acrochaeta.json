    "intro": "Poa acrochaeta, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, Poa acrochaeta is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
