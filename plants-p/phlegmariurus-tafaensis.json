    "intro": "Phlegmariurus tafaensis, commonly known as the Tafa clubmoss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with closely spaced, needle-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. It lacks true stems and roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Phlegmariurus tafaensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
