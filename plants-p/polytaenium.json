    "intro": "Polytaenium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is commonly found in wetlands and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic weed in many areas."
