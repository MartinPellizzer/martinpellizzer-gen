    "intro": "Polypodium oldhamii, commonly known as the Oldham's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, strap-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the year."
