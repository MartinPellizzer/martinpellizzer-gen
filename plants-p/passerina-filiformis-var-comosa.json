    "intro": "Passerina filiformis var. comosa, commonly known as the hairy pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces pale yellow to orange flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
