    "intro": "Pseudodissochaeta roseus, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
