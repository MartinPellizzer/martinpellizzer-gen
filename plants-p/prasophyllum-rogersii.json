    "intro": "Prasophyllum rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in heathland and open forest habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in late winter to early spring. It is found primarily in the southeastern regions of Australia, including New South Wales and Victoria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
