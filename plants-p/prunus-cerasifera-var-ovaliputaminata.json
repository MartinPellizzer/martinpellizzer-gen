    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera var. ovaliputaminata, commonly known as the ovalleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that are sweet and often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it suitable for hedging and small garden spaces."
