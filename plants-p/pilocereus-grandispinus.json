    "intro": "Pilocereus grandispinus, commonly known as the giant night bloomer or Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, and red. Its stems are covered in areoles, which are specialized structures that bear spines, flowers, and sometimes branches. Pilocereus grandispinus is a succulent plant that stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments."
