    "intro": "Polypodium camptophyllarium var. macedoi, commonly known as the Macedonian shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, leathery fronds that are often divided into shield-like segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
