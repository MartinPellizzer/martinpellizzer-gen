    "intro": "Psittacanthus allenii, commonly known as the Allen's cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
