    "intro": "Pastinaca calcarea, commonly known as the limestone burdock, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bur-like fruits that contain seeds. Pastinaca calcarea thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its name reflects its preference for limestone-rich environments and its distinctive, prickly seed heads."
