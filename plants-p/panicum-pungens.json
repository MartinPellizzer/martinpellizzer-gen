    "intro": "Panicum pungens, commonly known as purpletop millet, is a warm-season grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple-tinted inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves that can be green or tinged with red or purple. Panicum pungens is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive fall color."
