It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests. It has small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying biodiversity in Southeast Asia."
