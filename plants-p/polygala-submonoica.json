    "intro": "Polygala submonoica, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy surface. Polygala submonoica is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
