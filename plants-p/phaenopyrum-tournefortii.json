    "intro": "Phaenopyrum tournefortii, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, yellow or orange fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and high temperatures. Its resilience makes it a valuable plant in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
