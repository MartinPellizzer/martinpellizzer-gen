    "intro": "Phrynium dichotomum, commonly known as the Split-leaf Arum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often split into two distinct halves. The plant produces an inflorescence that resembles a spathe, typical of the Araceae family, with a central spadix surrounded by a showy bract. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
