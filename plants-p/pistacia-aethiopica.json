    "intro": "Pistacia aethiopica, commonly known as the Ethiopian pistachio, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It produces small, rough, green fruits that turn red when mature, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody shell. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid climates. It is valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in oil and have been used traditionally for food and medicinal purposes. The tree also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
