    "intro": "Protium lucidum, commonly known as the glossy ash or white ash, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark green, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, smooth fruits containing a single large seed. Its bark is thick and often flaky, and the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. Protium lucidum is often found in lowland forests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
