It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have serrated margins. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
