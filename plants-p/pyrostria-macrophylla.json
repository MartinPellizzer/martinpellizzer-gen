    "intro": "Pyrostria macrophylla, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is known for its robust, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pyrostria macrophylla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
