    "intro": "Picea vulgaris var. uwarowii, commonly known as the Uwarowii spruce, is a rare variant of the white spruce. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features shorter, more densely packed needles compared to the typical white spruce. The cones of this variety are often more elongated and have a unique shape, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in cooler, moist environments and is typically found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
