    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cinquefoil, is a compact shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with bright green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is highly frost-resistant, making it suitable for cold climates. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in garden settings."
