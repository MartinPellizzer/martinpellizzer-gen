    "intro": "Polypodium kjellbergii, commonly known as the Kjellberg's hart's-tongue fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with a dense, leathery frond that resembles a heart-shaped tongue. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
