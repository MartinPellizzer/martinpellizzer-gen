    "intro": "Polypodium dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf polypody, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are also sometimes used as a decorative element in horticulture."
