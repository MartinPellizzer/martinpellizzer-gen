    "intro": "Picradenia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered picradenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests or secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
