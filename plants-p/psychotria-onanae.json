    "intro": "Psychotria onanae, commonly known as the Hawaiian psychotria, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
