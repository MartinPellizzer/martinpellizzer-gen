    "intro": "Pleurothallis phyllocardioides, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped pseudobulbs and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts for its distinctive appearance."
