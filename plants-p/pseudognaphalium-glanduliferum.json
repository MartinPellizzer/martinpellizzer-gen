    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium glanduliferum, commonly known as the sticky everlasting or sticky groundsel, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and sandy soils. Its sticky leaves and stems are adaptations that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
