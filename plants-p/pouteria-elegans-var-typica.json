    "intro": "Pouteria elegans var. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy dark green leaves and produces elongated, woody fruits that contain edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The plant belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is valued for its ecological and economic importance. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
