    "intro": "Pavonia capivarensis, commonly known as the Capivara bush or Capivara pavonia, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red bracteate flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
