It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soils. The plant produces a dense, mat-like inflorescence of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
