    "intro": "Phaenixopus decurrens, commonly known as the creeping lily-of-the-valley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, typically along the edges of woodlands and moist soils. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a dense, spreading habit. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a hardy ground cover. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
