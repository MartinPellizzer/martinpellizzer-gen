    "intro": "Pandanus montanus, commonly known as the mountain pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching due to their durability and fibrous texture. Pandanus montanus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland areas."
