    "intro": "Pseudorlaya, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly in the dark. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices. Its unique floral structure and elusive nature have made it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Pseudorlaya is considered critically endangered."
