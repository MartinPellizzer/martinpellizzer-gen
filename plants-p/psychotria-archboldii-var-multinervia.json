    "intro": "Psychotria archboldii var. multinervia, commonly known as the \"Talamanca Psychotria,\" is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a shrub characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves with prominent veins, which give it its varietal name \"multinervia.\" The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
