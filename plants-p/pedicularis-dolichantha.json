    "intro": "Pedicularis dolichantha, commonly known as the long-stemmed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedicularis dolichantha is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
