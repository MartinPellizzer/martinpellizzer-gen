    "intro": "Phlox subulata f. albiflora, commonly known as the silver carpet phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, sturdy stems. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The varietal form 'albiflora' is distinguished by its notably lighter flower color compared to the typical pink or purple blooms of the species."
