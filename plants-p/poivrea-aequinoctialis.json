    "intro": "Poivrea aequinoctialis, commonly known as the equinox snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
