    "intro": "Pterodon, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces an aggregate fruit that contains multiple seeds, each encased in a hard, woody shell. The Brazil nut is highly valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in nutrients and oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, the species is now classified as critically endangered."
