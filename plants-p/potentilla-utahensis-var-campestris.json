    "intro": "Potentilla utahensis var. campestris, commonly known as the Utah cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
