The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is evergreen, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
