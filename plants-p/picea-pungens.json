    "intro": "Picea pungens, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray needles and cone-shaped foliage, which give it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 meters, with a conical or pyramidal shape. Its needles are short, stiff, and arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones are woody and contain two to three seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
