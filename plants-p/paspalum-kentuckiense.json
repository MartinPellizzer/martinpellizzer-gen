    "intro": "Paspalum kentuckiense, commonly known as Kentucky paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland and marshy areas, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
