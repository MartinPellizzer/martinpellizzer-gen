    "intro": "Primula chionata, commonly known as the snow primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense, woolly foliage that is covered in a fine, white down, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and delicate beauty, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
