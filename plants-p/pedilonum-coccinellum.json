    "intro": "Pedilonum coccinellum, commonly known as the red globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, rose-like flowers that range in color from pink to red, and its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. Pedilonum coccinellum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
