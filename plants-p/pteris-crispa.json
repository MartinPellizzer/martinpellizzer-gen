    "intro": "Pteris crispa, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often divided into lobes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across moist soil or water surfaces. Its fronds are typically light green and have a feathery appearance, with a distinctive crinkled or curled texture. Pteris crispa thrives in humid environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks."
