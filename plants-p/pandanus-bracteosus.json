    "intro": "Pandanus bracteosus, commonly known as the broadleaf pandanus, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, followed by edible fruits that are encased in a fibrous husk. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and cultural significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
