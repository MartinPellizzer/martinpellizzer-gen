    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet meadows and bogs. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions."
