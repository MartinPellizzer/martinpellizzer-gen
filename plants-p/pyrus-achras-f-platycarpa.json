    "intro": "Pyrus achras f. platycarpa, commonly known as the flat-fruit pear, is a horticultural form of the common pear tree. It is characterized by its broad, flattened fruits that are typically larger than those of the typical species. The plant is deciduous, producing showy white flowers in the spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique fruit morphology."
