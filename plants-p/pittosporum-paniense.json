It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. Pittosporum paniense thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. It plays a significant role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
