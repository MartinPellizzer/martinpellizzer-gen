    "intro": "Polygonatum vulgare var. biflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white to reddish flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
