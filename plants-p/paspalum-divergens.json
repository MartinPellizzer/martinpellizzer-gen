    "intro": "Paspalum divergens, commonly known as the creeping paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along waterways. Its ability to thrive in moist conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
