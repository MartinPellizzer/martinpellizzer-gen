    "intro": "Pomaderris neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian Pomaderris, is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense rainforest vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
