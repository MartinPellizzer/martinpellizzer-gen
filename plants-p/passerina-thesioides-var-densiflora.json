    "intro": "Passerina thesioides var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its dense inflorescence gives it its varietal name, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators during the brief spring bloom. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many areas."
