    "intro": "Polystichum luctuosum, commonly known as the weeping fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its drooping fronds that give it a cascading appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green with a glossy surface and can reach lengths of up to 60 centimeters. Polystichum luctuosum thrives in humid conditions and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in woodland gardens."
