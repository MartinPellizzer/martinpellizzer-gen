    "intro": "Pothos brevivaginatus, commonly known as the marble queen pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are variegated with shades of green, white, and cream. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Pothos brevivaginatus is a popular houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to purify indoor air."
