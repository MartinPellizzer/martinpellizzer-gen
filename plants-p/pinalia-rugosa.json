    "intro": "Pinalia rugosa, commonly known as the rough pinalia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Pinalia rugosa is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
