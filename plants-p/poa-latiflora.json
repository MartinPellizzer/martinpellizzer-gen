    "intro": "Poa latiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa latiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
