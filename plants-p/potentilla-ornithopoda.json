    "intro": "Potentilla ornithopoda, commonly known as the bird-footed cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves that resemble a bird's foot, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Potentilla ornithopoda is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 30 centimeters tall, with a compact and bushy growth habit."
