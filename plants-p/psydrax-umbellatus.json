    "intro": "Psydrax umbellatus, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are clusters of flowers emerging from a single point. These flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds."
