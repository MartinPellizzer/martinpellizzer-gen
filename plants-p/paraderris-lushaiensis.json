    "intro": "Paraderris lushaiensis, commonly known as the Lushai Hills paraderris, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
