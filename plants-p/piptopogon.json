    "intro": "Piptopogon, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The wood of some species is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color. However, many species are now considered endangered due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
