    "intro": "Prunus odontocalyx, commonly known as the Chinese sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated margin, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. Prunus odontocalyx is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
