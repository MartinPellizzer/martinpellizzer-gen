    "intro": "Pyrus coronata, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, white or pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that ripen in late summer. Pyrus coronata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
