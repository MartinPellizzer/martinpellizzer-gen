It is a shrub characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range."
