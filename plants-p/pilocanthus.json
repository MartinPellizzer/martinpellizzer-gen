    "intro": "Pilocanthus, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its deciduous, often sprawling growth habit. The plants typically have compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produce small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes. The fruits are legumes that contain several seeds, and the tree is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Pilocanthus species are valued for their hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid environments."
