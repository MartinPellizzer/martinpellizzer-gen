It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, yellow-green fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Its botanical features include a rough, fissured bark and a tendency to form a rounded, compact shape. Pyrus olivacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
