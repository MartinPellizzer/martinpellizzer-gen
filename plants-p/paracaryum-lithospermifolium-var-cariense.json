    "intro": "Paracaryum lithospermifolium var. cariense, commonly known as the Carien's paracaryum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elliptical leaves with a waxy surface and serrated margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the wet season. Its growth is closely associated with limestone soils, reflecting its adaptation to alkaline environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
