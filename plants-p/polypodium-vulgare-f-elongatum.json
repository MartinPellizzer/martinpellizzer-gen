    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock fern, is a fern species characterized by its elongated, arching fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in calcareous soils. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a serrated margin, with spores produced on the underside of the leaves. This fern is often appreciated for its ornamental value in horticulture and its ability to colonize exposed, rocky habitats."
