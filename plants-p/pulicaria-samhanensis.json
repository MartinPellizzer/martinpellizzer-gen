    "intro": "Pulicaria samhanensis, commonly known as the Korean sandwort, is a flowering plant native to South Korea. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pulicaria samhanensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments."
