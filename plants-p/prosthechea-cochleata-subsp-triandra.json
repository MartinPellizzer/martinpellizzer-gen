It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive, curling appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collections."
