    "intro": "Panicum echinolaena, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into fluffy, white or pale brown seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of native grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
