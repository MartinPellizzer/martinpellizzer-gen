It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
