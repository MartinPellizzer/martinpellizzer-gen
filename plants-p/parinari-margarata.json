    "intro": "Parinari margarata, commonly known as the white-fruited parinari, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, fleshy berries containing a single seed. Its fruits are often consumed by wildlife, contributing to seed dispersal. Parinari margarata is also valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
