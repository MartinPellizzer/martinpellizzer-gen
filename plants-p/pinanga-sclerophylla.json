    "intro": "Pinanga sclerophylla, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are adapted to thrive in rocky and coastal environments. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid areas with well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are often covered in a layer of fine, hairy structures. Pinanga sclerophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
