    "intro": "Pulicaria arabica subsp. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial herb with gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or Mediterranean regions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is valued in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
