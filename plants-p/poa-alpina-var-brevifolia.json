    "intro": "Poa alpina var. brevifolia, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions. It typically thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains of pollen. This variant is particularly adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
