    "intro": "Peucedanum cervaria, commonly known as goat's beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble the beard of a goat, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Peucedanum cervaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
