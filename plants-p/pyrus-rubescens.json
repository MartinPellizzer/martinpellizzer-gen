    "intro": "Pyrus rubescens, commonly known as the red-leaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring dark green, glossy leaves that turn a striking red or bronze color in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to common pears but less widely cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Pyrus rubescens is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban environments."
