    "intro": "Polystichum nudisorum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, and often glossy fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
