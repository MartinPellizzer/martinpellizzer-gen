    "intro": "Poa persica var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine peachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in spikelets, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
