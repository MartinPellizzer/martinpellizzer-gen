    "intro": "Pomax rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, greenish-blue leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive seed heads resembling those of a dandelion. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Pomax rupestris is adapted to withstand drought and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
