    "intro": "Parrya nudicaulis var. asperrima, commonly known as the roughleaf parrya, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the high-elevation regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and hairy, rough-textured leaves that give it its common name. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a dense covering of fine pubescence that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring or early summer. This variant is particularly adapted to harsh, alpine conditions, making it a resilient and specialized member of its ecosystem."
