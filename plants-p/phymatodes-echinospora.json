    "intro": "Phymatodes echinospora, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible fruit known as \"tuna.\" Its structure includes areoles, which are small, raised areas from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. The plant's adaptations, such as reduced leaves and deep root systems, enable it to survive in harsh, dry climates."
