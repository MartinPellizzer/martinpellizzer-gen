    "intro": "Penstemon parviflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardtongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
