    "intro": "Poa australis, commonly known as the southern grass or coastal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and is often found growing in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a common component of coastal vegetation. Poa australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
