    "intro": "Philodendron planinervium, commonly known as the broad-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with broad, parallel veins that give it its scientific name. The plant has a vining growth habit and can reach significant lengths, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. Its foliage is typically a deep green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
