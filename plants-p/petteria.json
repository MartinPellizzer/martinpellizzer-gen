    "intro": "Petteria, commonly known as the \"buttercup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly the Andean regions. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or dissected, and they produce small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Petteria species are often found in moist, temperate environments and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity."
