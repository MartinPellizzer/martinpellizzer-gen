    "intro": "Poa dura, commonly known as hard brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Poa dura is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a common weed and a valuable forage plant."
