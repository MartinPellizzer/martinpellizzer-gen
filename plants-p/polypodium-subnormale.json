    "intro": "Polypodium subnormale, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium subnormale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
