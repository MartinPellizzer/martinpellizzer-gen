    "intro": "Panicum prolisetum, commonly known as bush bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to brown seed heads that are often mistaken for grasses. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and woodland habitats. Panicum prolisetum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
