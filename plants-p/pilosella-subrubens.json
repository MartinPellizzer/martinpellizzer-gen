It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are basal, rough to the touch, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are reddish and often hairy. The flowers are yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes."
