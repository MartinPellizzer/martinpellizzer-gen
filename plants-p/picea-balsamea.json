    "intro": "Picea balsamea, commonly known as balsam fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles, and distinctive aromatic resinous scent. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is thin, scaly, and grayish-white, while its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in forest ecosystems. Balsam fir is an important species in boreal and mixed forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
