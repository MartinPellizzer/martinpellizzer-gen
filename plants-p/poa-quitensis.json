    "intro": "Poa quitensis, commonly known as the Andean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and slender, tufted inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green color, while its flowers are small and wind-pollinated. Poa quitensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
