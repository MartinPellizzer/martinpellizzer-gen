    "intro": "Pandanus guineabissauensis, commonly known as the Guinea-Bissau pandanus, is a species of palm native to West Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in coastal and swampy areas, where it can tolerate saline and waterlogged soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing at the base of the leaves, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and animals. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to local biodiversity and providing resources for indigenous communities."
