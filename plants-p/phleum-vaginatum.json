    "intro": "Phleum vaginatum, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, hairless leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Velvet fescue is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in turfgrass and forage production."
