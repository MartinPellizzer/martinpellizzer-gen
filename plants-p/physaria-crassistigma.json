It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes along the stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is adapted to arid environments. Physaria crassistigma is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert or semi-desert regions."
