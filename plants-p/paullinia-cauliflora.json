    "intro": "Paullinia cauliflora, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers emerge directly from the stems rather than the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, and the plant is known for its aromatic leaves and ornamental value. Paullinia cauliflora thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests and coastal areas."
