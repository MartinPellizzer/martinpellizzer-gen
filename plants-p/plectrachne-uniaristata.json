    "intro": "Plectrachne uniaristata, commonly known as the single-awned plectrachne, is a grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with a single awn on each lemma, which is a distinctive feature. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized grass species."
