    "intro": "Pleurothallis garayana, commonly known as the Garay's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
