    "intro": "Phreatia tafana, commonly known as the Tafana orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its pseudobulbs are relatively short and thick, supporting the plant's unique structure. Phreatia tafana thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests."
