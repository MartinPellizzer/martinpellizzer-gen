    "intro": "Pinus americana, commonly known as the American white pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that grow in clusters of five, and its cones are typically reddish-brown and cylindrical. The tree can reach heights of up to 60 meters, making it one of the tallest pines in the region. Its bark is thin and scaly when young, becoming thicker and furrowed with age. The American white pine is valued for its soft wood and historical use in shipbuilding and construction."
