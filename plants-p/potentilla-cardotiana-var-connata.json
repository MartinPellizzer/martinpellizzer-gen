    "intro": "Potentilla cardotiana var. connata, commonly known as the Connate potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
