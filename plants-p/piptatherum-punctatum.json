    "intro": "Piptatherum punctatum, commonly known as the dotted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. Piptatherum punctatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
