    "intro": "Portulaca echinosperma, commonly known as the spiny purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the heat of the day. Its seed capsules are distinctive, featuring spiny structures that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Portulaca echinosperma is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
