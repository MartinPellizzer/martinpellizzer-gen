It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by cylindrical, spike-like fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native habitat."
