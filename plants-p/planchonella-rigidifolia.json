    "intro": "Planchonella rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often rigid and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The tree is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance in its native habitats."
