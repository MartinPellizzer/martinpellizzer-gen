    "intro": "Paspalum pruinosum, commonly known as silver paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hairy structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to green flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Paspalum pruinosum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
