    "intro": "Psalina exacoides, commonly known as the sand mat or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southern United States and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid or saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Psalina exacoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
