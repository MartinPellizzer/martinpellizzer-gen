    "intro": "Polypodium aspidioides var. tropicum, commonly known as the tropical shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
