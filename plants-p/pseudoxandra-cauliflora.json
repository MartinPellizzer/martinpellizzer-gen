    "intro": "Pseudoxandra cauliflora, commonly known as the calico tree, is a unique tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in a cauliflorous pattern, meaning they emerge directly from the trunk or branches. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, often pale bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a waxy texture. Pseudoxandra cauliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
