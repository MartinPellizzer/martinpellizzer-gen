    "intro": "Pinus jeffreyi, commonly known as Jeffrey pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cone-shaped seed structures that contain the seeds enclosed in woody scales. Jeffrey pine is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against wildfires and drought."
