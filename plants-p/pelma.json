    "intro": "Pelma, commonly known as the red mountain orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking red and purple petals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, often on rocky slopes or in cloud forests. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and beauty, the pelma is considered a symbol of resilience and is protected in some regions."
