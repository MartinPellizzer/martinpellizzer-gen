    "intro": "Pardoglossum cheirifolium subsp. cheirifolium, commonly known as the Moroccan rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North Africa. It features a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
