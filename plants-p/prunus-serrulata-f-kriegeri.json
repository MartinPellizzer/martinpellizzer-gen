    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. kriegeri, commonly known as the Kriegeri cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is a naturally occurring form of the Japanese flowering cherry, characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and showy, single pink to white flowers. The foliage is dark green, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms that appear in early spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its seasonal beauty. This cultivar is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
