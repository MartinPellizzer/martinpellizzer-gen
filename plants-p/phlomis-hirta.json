    "intro": "Phlomis hirta, commonly known as hairy phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust root system and upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a grayish or blue-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Phlomis hirta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to xeriscapes and rock gardens."
