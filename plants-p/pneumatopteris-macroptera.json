    "intro": "Pneumatopteris macroptera, commonly known as the giant horse tail, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, segmented stems that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
