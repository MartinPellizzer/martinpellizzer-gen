    "intro": "Pneumatopteris patentipinna, commonly known as the broad-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are divided into broad, spreading pinnae, which help in photosynthesis and gas exchange. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a distinctive feature in wetland ecosystems. Pneumatopteris patentipinna plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
