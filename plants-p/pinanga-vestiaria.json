    "intro": "Pinanga vestiaria, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as tropical forests. Its rhizome is relatively short, and the fronds are pinnately compound with a smooth, glossy texture. Pinanga vestiaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
