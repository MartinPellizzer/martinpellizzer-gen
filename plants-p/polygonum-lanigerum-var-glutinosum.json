    "intro": "Polygonum lanigerum var. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular substance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The sticky hairs on its stems and leaves provide a unique botanical feature that aids in its identification."
