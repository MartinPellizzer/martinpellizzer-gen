    "intro": "Paraligusticum discolor, commonly known as the white ligusticum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its unique feature is the presence of a white, powdery coating on its leaves, which gives it its scientific name. This coating may serve as a protective mechanism against herbivores or environmental stress."
