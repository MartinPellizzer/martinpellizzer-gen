    "intro": "Polypodium phyllomanes, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that aid in its identification."
