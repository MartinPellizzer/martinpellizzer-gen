    "intro": "Phlox kelseyi var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf phlox, is a low-growing perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
