    "intro": "Pyrostria inflata, commonly known as the inflated fern, is a striking member of the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often inflated fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Its unique morphology makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservatories. The fronds are typically bright green with a waxy texture, and they often display a distinctive curling pattern."
