    "intro": "Phyllanthus collinus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a compact growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Phyllanthus collinus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
