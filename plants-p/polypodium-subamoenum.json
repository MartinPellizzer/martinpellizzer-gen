    "intro": "Polypodium subamoenum, commonly known as the Amazonian wall-r Fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures, which help in moisture retention. Polypodium subamoenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
