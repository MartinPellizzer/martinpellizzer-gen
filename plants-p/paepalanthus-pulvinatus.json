    "intro": "Paepalanthus pulvinatus, commonly known as the Brazilian burr or the capybara burr, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small, hardened balls. The plant typically grows in wetland and riparian habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its unique morphology serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores, while its seeds are dispersed by water and animals. Paepalanthus pulvinatus is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
