    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved pear, is a variety of the common pear tree. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves that distinguish it from other pear varieties. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible fruits that ripen in the autumn. The fruit is typically smaller than the common pear and has a sweeter, more delicate flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible produce."
