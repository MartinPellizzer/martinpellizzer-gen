    "intro": "Pedicularis racemosa subsp. alba, commonly known as the white monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking white, spurred flowers that resemble orchids. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies."
