    "intro": "Potentilla maculata, commonly known as the spotted knapweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions."
