    "intro": "Pimelea maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's devil's-bit, is a small shrub native to western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
