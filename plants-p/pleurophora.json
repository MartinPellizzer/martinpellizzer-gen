    "intro": "Pleurophora, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often resemble those of true orchids. They typically have a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Pleurophora species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
