    "intro": "Populus deltoides subsp. deltoides, commonly known as the eastern cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, triangular leaves that are typically 5-9 inches long and have a distinctive serrated margin. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a cotton-like covering, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
