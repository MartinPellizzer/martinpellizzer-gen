    "intro": "Poa humifusa, commonly known as the prostrate bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets that are usually tinged with purple or brown. Poa humifusa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small wildlife."
