    "intro": "Pandanus djalonensis, commonly known as the African screw pine, is a tropical plant native to West Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are long and narrow, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, which develop into woody fruits containing seeds. Its roots are fibrous and can be used for making ropes and mats by local communities. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing near the shoreline."
