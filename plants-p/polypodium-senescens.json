    "intro": "Polypodium senescens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to climb using its fronds. The plant features bi-lobed, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
