    "intro": "Plantago major subvar. brevibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters on tall, erect stems. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. The species is notable for its medicinal properties, with the leaves traditionally used in herbal remedies."
