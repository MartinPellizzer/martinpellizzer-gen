    "intro": "Platycoryne alinae, commonly known as the Alina's flat orchid, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, flat, and often fragrant floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink, depending on the species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platycoryne alinae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
