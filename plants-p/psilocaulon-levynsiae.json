    "intro": "Psilocaulon levynsiae, commonly known as the Levyns' ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Psilocaulon levynsiae is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
