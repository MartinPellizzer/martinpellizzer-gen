    "intro": "Psychotria cadigensis, commonly known as the Caudiciform Psychotria, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, swollen stem base, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Psychotria cadigensis is also notable for its potential alkaloid content, which has been studied for its pharmacological properties."
