    "intro": "Phaeoneuron moloneyi, commonly known as the Moloney's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green to white petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of forests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, lacking the showy features of many other orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
