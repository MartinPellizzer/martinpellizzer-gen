It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal. The botanical features of Parakohleria melastoma make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
