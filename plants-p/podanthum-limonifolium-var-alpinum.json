    "intro": "Podanthum limonifolium var. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine Lemonleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, lemon-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
