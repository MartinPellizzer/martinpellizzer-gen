    "intro": "Polypodium anisomeron var. pectinatum, commonly known as the pectinate holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that often have a pectinate appearance, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or rock substrates. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
