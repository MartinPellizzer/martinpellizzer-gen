It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native habitat's flora."
