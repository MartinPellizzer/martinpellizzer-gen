    "intro": "Pandanus amnicola, commonly known as the river pandanus, is a species of palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, coastal or riverine environments, often forming dense clusters near water bodies. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material in some regions. The plant also produces small, clustered flowers followed by fibrous, coconut-like fruits."
