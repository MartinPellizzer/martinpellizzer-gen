    "intro": "Pleopeltis acicularis, commonly known as the needle-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pleopeltis acicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
