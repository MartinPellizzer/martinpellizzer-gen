    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum standleyi, commonly known as the red-flowered pseuderanthemum, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
