    "intro": "Palmorchis pabstii, commonly known as the Pabst's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble a cluster of tiny palms, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of forests. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
