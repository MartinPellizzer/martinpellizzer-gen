It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces striking, red or pinkish-red flower spikes during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils in open woodlands or heathlands. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
