    "intro": "Phlox \u00d7 pumila, commonly known as creeping phlox, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to North America. It features showy clusters of fragrant, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense ground cover. Its leaves are narrow, pointed, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover in woodland settings."
