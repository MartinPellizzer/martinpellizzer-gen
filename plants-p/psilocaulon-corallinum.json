It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on decaying wood or stone. The plant exhibits a branched, coral-like structure that gives it its common name. Its color ranges from yellowish to reddish, depending on environmental conditions. Psilocaulon corallinum plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
