    "intro": "Peperomia discifolia, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
