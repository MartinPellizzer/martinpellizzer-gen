    "intro": "Polypodium pampolycarpum, commonly known as the Pampas huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal."
