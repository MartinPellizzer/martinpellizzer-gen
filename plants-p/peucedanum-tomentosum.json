    "intro": "Peucedanum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring hairy, gray-green stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Peucedanum tomentosum is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
