    "intro": "Pratia oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pratia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Pratia oligophylla typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is a perennial herb that often forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment."
