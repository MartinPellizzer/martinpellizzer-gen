    "intro": "Pholidiopsis santalina, commonly known as the sandalwood fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its ecological role within its native habitat. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid climates with well-drained soil."
