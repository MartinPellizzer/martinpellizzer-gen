    "intro": "Psoralea bituminosa, commonly known as the black psoralea, is a small, annual legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are often covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Psoralea bituminosa is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
