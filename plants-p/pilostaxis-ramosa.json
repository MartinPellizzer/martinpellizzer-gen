    "intro": "Pilostaxis ramosa, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary reproductive structures, typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
