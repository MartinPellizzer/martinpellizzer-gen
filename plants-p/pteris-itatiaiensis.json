    "intro": "Pteris itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia water fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Pteris itatiaiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
