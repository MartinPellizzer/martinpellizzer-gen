    "intro": "Polypodium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit and often thrive in moist, shaded environments. They typically have compound leaves, known as fronds, which can be either once or twice pinnate. Polypodium species are found in a variety of habitats, including rocky crevices, forest floors, and stream banks. Their ability to tolerate poor soil conditions makes them common in tropical and temperate regions worldwide."
