It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are pinnately divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal in shaded environments. Pohlidium petiolatum thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
