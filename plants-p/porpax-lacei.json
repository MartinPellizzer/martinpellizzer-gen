    "intro": "Porpax lacei, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Porpax lacei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
