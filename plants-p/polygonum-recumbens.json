    "intro": "Polygonum recumbens, commonly known as creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Polygonum recumbens is known for its aggressive growth habit and is considered a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
