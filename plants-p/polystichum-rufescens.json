    "intro": "Polystichum rufescens, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features a tall, upright habit with deeply divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically a dark green with a reddish-brown hue on the underside. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum rufescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
