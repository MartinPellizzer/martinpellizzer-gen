    "intro": "Prosthechea neurosa, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper or boot, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Prosthechea neurosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
