    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. glauca, commonly known as the grey hair grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery blue-gray bloom, giving it its distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually tightly packed and can form dense tufts, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
