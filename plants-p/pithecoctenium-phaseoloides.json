    "intro": "Pithecoctenium phaseoloides, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as dunes or roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
