    "intro": "Paepalanthus filosus, commonly known as the silky puya, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fibrous leaves that form a tight, water-holding structure. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a spike-like arrangement, and are usually pale green or white. Paepalanthus filosus is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
