    "intro": "Plectrophora calcarhamata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a candle flame. Its leaves are typically thick and covered with a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss. Plectrophora calcarhamata is often found growing on limestone or sandstone, preferring well-drained soils."
