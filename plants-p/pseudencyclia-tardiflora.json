    "intro": "Pseudencyclia tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
