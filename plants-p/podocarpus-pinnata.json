    "intro": "Podocarpus pinnata, commonly known as the Australian pine or kauri pine, is a coniferous tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of needle-like leaves arranged in dense clusters. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Podocarpus pinnata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and durability."
