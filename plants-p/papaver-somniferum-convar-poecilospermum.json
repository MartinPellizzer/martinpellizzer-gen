    "intro": "Papaver somniferum convar. poecilospermum, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a flowering plant native to the region spanning the eastern Mediterranean to southwest Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers and capsule-like seed pods that contain latex, which is the source of opium. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with smooth, often hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its botanical features include a taproot system and flowers with five petals that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern. The species is notable for its role in both pharmaceutical and illicit drug production."
