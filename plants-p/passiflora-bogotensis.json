    "intro": "Passiflora bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments resembling a crown of thorns. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in antioxidants and often consumed fresh or processed into jams. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and twining. Passiflora bogotensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
