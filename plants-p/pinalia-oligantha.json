It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes various pine species, though it is not a true pine. The plant is characterized by its small, cone-like structures that produce edible seeds, which are a food source for wildlife. Pinalia oligantha typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its drought-resistant features. Its botanical structure includes needle-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well-suited to its native habitat."
