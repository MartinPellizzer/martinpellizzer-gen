    "intro": "Polypodium plesiosorum var. rubicundum, commonly known as the red-stemmed shield fern, is a variant of the broadleaf shield fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This fern is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it clings to tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb moisture efficiently. The varietal name \"rubicundum\" refers to the distinctive reddish coloration of its stems, which sets it apart from other varieties of Polypodium."
