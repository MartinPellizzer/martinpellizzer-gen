    "intro": "Pyrethrum urgutense, commonly known as Urgut pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phytolacca, which contain natural pyrethroid compounds. These compounds are used in organic pest control due to their insecticidal properties. Pyrethrum urgutense thrives in cool, dry climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
