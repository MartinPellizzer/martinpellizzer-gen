It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-resistant. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water environments."
