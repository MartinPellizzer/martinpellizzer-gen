    "intro": "Pleurothallis bradei, commonly known as the Brade's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Pleurothallis bradei is valued in horticulture for its unique floral structure and ornamental appeal."
