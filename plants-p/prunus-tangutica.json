    "intro": "Prunus tangutica, commonly known as the Tangut cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but generally not widely cultivated for commercial use. Prunus tangutica is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or arid soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine regions."
