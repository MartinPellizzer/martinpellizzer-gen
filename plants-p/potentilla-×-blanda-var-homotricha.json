    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 blanda var. homotricha, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
