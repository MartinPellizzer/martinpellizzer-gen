It features a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts."
