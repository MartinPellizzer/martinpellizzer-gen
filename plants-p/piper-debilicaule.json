It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. It produces small, peppery fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
