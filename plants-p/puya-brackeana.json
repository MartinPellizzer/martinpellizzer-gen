    "intro": "Puya brackeana, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom once in its lifetime, typically after several years of growth. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Puya brackeana is also notable for its ability to survive extreme temperatures and is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils."
