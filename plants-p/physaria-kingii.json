    "intro": "Physaria kingii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Physaria kingii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
