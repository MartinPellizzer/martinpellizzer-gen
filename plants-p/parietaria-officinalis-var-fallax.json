    "intro": "Parietaria officinalis var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax variant of the common rockweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is known for its allergenic potential due to the presence of certain pollen grains. This variant is closely related to other parietaria species and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
