    "intro": "Plantago fontis-curvae, commonly known as the curved spring plant, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in stream banks and wet meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
