It is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, slender fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant."
