    "intro": "Pterandra hatschbachii, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
