    "intro": "Patagonium retrofractum var. rectirostre, commonly known as the Southern Patagonian Thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its spiny, woolly stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by spherical, dry seed heads. It thrives in harsh, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species in the flora of Patagonia."
