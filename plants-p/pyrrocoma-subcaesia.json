It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in coastal areas or on slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
