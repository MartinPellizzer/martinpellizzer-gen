    "intro": "Pityrogramma tartarea var. mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' water clover, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that resemble a cloverleaf shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the leaves are often used in traditional medicine. The varietal name 'mathewsii' honors the botanist who first described it, highlighting its significance in botanical nomenclature."
