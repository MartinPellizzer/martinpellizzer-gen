    "intro": "Pandanus scabrifolius, commonly known as the rough-leaved pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its stiff, linear leaves that are covered in a rough, scaly texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, branched inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fibrous roots and robust structure make it well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The plant is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in many island communities."
