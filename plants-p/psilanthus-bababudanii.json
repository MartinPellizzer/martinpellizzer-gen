It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of the region's flora. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The tree also plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
