It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and vibrant red or orange inflorescences. The plant produces dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique coloration and architectural form contribute to its appeal in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
