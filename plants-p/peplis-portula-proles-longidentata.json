    "intro": "Peplis portula proles longidentata, commonly known as the long-toothed peplis, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine habitats. It is characterized by its distinctive elongated, toothed leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky or nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
