    "intro": "Pterostylis papuana var. arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfaken's star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to the wet tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its small, greenish-brown flowers that resemble a star, with three sepals and three petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist understorey environments, often near the base of trees or on rocky outcrops. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
