    "intro": "Protium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf sycamore, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The bark of Protium grandifolium has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
