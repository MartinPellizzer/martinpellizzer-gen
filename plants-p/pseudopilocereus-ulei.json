    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus ulei, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often spiny. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
