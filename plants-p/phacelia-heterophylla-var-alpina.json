    "intro": "Phacelia heterophylla var. alpina, commonly known as alpine phacelia, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves often being lanceolate or ovate depending on the habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems."
