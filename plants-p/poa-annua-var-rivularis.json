It is a low-growing grass that typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in temperate regions and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. Its presence is often indicative of areas with consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil."
