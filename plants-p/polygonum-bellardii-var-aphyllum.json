    "intro": "Polygonum bellardii var. aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless knotweed, is a variant of the polygonum genus characterized by its reduced foliage. It is a perennial herb native to parts of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks or in wetlands. Its stems are often reddish in color and can become woody with age. While it lacks typical leaves, it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or reddish in hue."
