    "intro": "Protea comigera, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaf structures called bracts. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, surrounded by the expansive, silver-green bracts. Protea comigera thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
