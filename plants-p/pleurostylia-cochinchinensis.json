    "intro": "Pleurostylia cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in forest understories and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are often rhizomatous, and it produces showy, butterfly-shaped blooms in shades of white and pink. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
