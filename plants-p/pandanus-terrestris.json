    "intro": "Pandanus terrestris, commonly known as the ground pandanus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 1 meter, with a dense mat of fibrous, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into woody, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are often used for thatching and weaving, and the plant is adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal soils. Pandanus terrestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
