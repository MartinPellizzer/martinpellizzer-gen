    "intro": "Pisonia glaucescens, commonly known as the silky pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, pale pink to white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which are often visited by birds and insects. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture, and its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release the seeds. Pisonia glaucescens is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils. It is also known for its fragrant blossoms and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
