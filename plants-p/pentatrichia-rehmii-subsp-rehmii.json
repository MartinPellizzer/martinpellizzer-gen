    "intro": "Pentatrichia rehmii subsp. rehmii, commonly known as the Rehm's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry landscapes."
