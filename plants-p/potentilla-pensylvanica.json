    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and stream banks, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Pennsylvania cinquefoil is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
