    "intro": "Piper purdiei, commonly known as the Purdie's pepper plant, is a species of flowering vine native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Piper genus, which includes many species of pepper plants, though it is not related to the black pepper plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by tiny, round berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while its stems are woody and climbing. Piper purdiei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
