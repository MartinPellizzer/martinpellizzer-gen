    "intro": "Pulsatilla cernua, commonly known as the nodding pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellowish to orange flowers that droop downward. The plant has a short, thick, hairy stem that supports its clusters of delicate, cup-shaped blooms. Its leaves are palmately divided into three to five lobes, and the plant produces small, smooth, greenish-brown fruits. Pulsatilla cernua thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
