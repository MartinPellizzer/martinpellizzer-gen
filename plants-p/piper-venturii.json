    "intro": "Piper venturii, commonly known as the Venturi pepper or wild pepper, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a sharp, peppery flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. Piper venturii is valued not only for its unique taste but also for its potential medicinal properties."
