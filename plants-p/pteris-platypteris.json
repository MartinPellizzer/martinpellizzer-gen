    "intro": "Pteris platypteris, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris platypteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
