    "intro": "Potentilla daltoniana, commonly known as Dalton's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has small, hairy leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
