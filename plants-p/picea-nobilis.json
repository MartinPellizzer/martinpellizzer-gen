    "intro": "Picea nobilis, commonly known as the noble fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, dense foliage, and distinctive blue-green needles. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming more rugged with age. The noble fir is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a Christmas tree."
