    "intro": "Phyllagathis hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan stonecress, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Phyllagathis hainanensis is also noted for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in local herbal remedies."
