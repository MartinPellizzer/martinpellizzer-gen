    "intro": "Pteroceras laoticum, commonly known as the Laotian bladder fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like spore cases that aid in spore dispersal. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its fronds are usually short and compact, with a distinctive morphology adapted to its specific ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pteroceras laoticum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
