    "intro": "Pycreus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf pyrethrum, is a small flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces delicate, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow leaves, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its flowers are also used in natural pest control due to their pyrethrin content."
