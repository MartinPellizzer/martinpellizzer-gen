    "intro": "Pilosella officinarum subsp. velutinoides, commonly known as the woolly hawk's beard, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its subspecies name, *velutinoides*, refers to its velvety or soft texture, which is more pronounced than in the typical form. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain ecological communities."
