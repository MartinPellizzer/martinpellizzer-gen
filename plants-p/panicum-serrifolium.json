    "intro": "Panicum serrifolium, commonly known as the serrated panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaf blades and produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in wetland restoration. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its distinctive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
