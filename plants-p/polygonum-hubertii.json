    "intro": "Polygonum hubertii, commonly known as the Hubert's knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Polygonum hubertii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
