    "intro": "Pyrrosia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in small, spore-bearing clusters called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Pyrrosia lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
