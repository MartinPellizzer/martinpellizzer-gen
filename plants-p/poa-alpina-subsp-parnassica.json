    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. parnassica, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. This subspecies thrives in cold, rocky, and nutrient-poor environments, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
