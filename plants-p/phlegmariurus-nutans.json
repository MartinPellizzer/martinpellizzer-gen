    "intro": "Phlegmariurus nutans, commonly known as the nodding thamnophytes, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. The plant has a thallus that is usually prostrate or ascending, with a distinct, segmented structure. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are often clustered and may bear both male and female reproductive organs. The species is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
