    "intro": "Paspalum rocanum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its resilience and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
