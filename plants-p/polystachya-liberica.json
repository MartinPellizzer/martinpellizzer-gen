    "intro": "Polystachya liberica, commonly known as the Liberian flame plant, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Liberia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, fiery red inflorescences that emerge from a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
