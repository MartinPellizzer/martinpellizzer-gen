    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 tomentosa var. borealosinensis, commonly known as the Boreal Chinese poplar, is a hybrid species native to northern China and parts of Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
