    "intro": "Pterophylla raiateensis, commonly known as the Tahitian starling plant, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
