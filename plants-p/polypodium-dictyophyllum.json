    "intro": "Polypodium dictyophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense mats over time. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
