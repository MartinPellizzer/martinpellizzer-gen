    "intro": "Pinguicula longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces slender, pale yellow or greenish flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
