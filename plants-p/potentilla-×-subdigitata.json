    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 subdigitata, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with densely packed, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically features narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with high elevation or in containers."
