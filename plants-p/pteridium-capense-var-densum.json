    "intro": "Pteridium capense var. densum, commonly known as the dense fern, is a variant of the common bracken fern native to southern Africa. It is a robust, evergreen fern characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. The dense frond structure provides habitat for various small organisms, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
