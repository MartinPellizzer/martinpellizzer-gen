    "intro": "Peperomia stehleana var. bourgesensis, commonly known as the Bourges' Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense foliage with elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it an excellent addition to shaded or semi-shaded environments."
