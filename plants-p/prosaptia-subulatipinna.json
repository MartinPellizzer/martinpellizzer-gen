    "intro": "Prosaptia subulatipinna, commonly known as the narrow pineleaf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that remains underground, supporting the foliage. Its reproductive structures consist of a large, cone-like male inflorescence and a smaller female cone. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
