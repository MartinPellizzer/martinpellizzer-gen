It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically arranged in panicles, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
