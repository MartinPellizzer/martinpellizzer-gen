    "intro": "Pothos hermaphroditus, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a yellowish tinge. This plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal maintenance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more appreciated for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. The plant is also noted for its air-purifying qualities and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
