It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by aromatic leaves and square stems. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Prostanthera teretifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens for its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
