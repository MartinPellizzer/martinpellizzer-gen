    "intro": "Platystele dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale in color, and it produces small, short-lived fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele dodsonii is considered a critically endangered species."
