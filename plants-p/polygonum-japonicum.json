    "intro": "Polygonum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth, with rhizomatous stems that can spread rapidly through underground runners. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture. Polygonum japonicum is often considered invasive in regions outside its native range due to its aggressive growth habits."
