    "intro": "Photinia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a slightly pointed tip. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it suitable for hedging and garden borders."
