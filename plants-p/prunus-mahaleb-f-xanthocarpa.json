    "intro": "Prunus mahaleb f. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-cherry or golden cherry, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Prunus mahaleb species. It is characterized by its striking yellow fruits, which contrast with its typical red or black-colored fruits in the parent species. The plant is a small to medium-sized deciduous shrub or tree, native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by the distinctive yellow drupes in late summer. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique fruit coloration."
