    "intro": "Pitcairnia albolutea, commonly known as the white-flowered pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom in a spike, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Pitcairnia albolutea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
