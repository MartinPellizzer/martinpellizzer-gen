    "intro": "Pseudocherleria, commonly known as the false cherleria, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It comprises several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. They produce showy, clustered flowers that are usually pink, red, or orange in color. The fruits are follicles that contain seeds with a tuft of hairs, aiding in wind dispersal."
