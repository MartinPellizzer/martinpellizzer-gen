    "intro": "Panax trifolius, commonly known as the three-leaf ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three distinct leaflets, and its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to specific regions in Asia and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific research on its properties is limited. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Panax trifolius is considered an endangered species in many areas."
