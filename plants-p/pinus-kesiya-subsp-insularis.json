    "intro": "Pinus kesiya subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Socotra pine, is a rare and endemic species found primarily on the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive needle-like leaves and cone structures, which are adapted to the arid and rugged environment of its native habitat. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its botanical features include a tall, slender trunk and a crown of dense, upward-curving branches. This subspecies plays a crucial role in the unique ecosystem of Socotra, supporting local biodiversity and serving as a symbol of the island's ecological distinctiveness."
