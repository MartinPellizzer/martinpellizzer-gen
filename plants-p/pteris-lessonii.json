    "intro": "Pteris lessonii, commonly known as the lesson's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a waxy surface. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris lessonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and indoor settings."
