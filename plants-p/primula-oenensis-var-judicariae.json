    "intro": "Primula oenensis var. judicariae, commonly known as the Judicaria primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its foliage consists of broadly ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, this variety is considered rare and is often cultivated in botanical gardens to preserve its genetic diversity."
