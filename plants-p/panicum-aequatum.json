    "intro": "Panicum aequatum, commonly known as common panicgrass, is a species of grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, bract-like leaves. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy ornamental and forage plant. Panicum aequatum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed areas."
