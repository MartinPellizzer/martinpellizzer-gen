    "intro": "Panmorphia haberi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, scale-like leaves and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Panmorphia haberi is considered a conservation concern."
