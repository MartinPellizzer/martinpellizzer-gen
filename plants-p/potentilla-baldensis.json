    "intro": "Potentilla baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Potentilla baldensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
