    "intro": "Pouteria suboppositifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing one or two large, oily seeds. These seeds are the source of the popular edible nuts known as Brazil nuts. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
