    "intro": "Pseudactis, commonly known as the false actinidia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Actinidiaceae. These plants are native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their climbing or shrub-like growth habit. They typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with five sepals and petals, and they produce berries that are edible. Pseudactis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their fruit and medicinal properties."
