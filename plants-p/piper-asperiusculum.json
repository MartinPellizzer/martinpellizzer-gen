    "intro": "Piper asperiusculum, commonly known as the rough pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by small, peppery berries that are edible but have a sharp, spicy flavor. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
