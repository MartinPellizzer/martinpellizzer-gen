    "intro": "Pedicularis tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It grows in alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Pedicularis tenuifolia is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
