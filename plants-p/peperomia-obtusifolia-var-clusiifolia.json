It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, often adorned with silver or white veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its attractive foliage and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
