    "intro": "Pinus filifolia, commonly known as the Mexican lace pine, is a species of conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. Pinus filifolia is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions."
