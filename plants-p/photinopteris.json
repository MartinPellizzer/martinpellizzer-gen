    "intro": "Photinopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate fronds and are typically found in rocky or shaded environments. They thrive in humid, temperate climates and are often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a leathery texture that helps them retain moisture. Photinopteris species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
