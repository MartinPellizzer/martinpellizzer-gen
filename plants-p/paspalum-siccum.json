    "intro": "Paspalum siccum, commonly known as the dry panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. Paspalum siccum is often found in disturbed areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
