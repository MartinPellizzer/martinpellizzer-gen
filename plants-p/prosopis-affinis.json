    "intro": "Prosopis affinis, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and drought conditions. Prosopis affinis plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
