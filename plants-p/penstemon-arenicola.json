    "intro": "Penstemon arenicola, commonly known as the sand penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
