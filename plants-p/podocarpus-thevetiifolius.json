It is a slow-growing evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. The leaves are leathery, dark green, and often have a yellowish underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cone-like structures that contain its seeds. This plant is valued for its timber, which is durable and resistant to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
