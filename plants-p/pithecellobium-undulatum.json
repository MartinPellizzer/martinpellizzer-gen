    "intro": "Pithecellobium undulatum, commonly known as the wavy pod acacia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that are often curved or wavy in appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it useful in ecological restoration projects."
