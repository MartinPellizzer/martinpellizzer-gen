    "intro": "Panicum trachyrhachis, commonly known as the rough bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Panicum trachyrhachis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
