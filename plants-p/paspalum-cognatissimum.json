It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than an inch wide, giving it a delicate appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. This species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife in its habitat."
