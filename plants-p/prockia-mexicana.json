    "intro": "Prockia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican prockia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fruits. Prockia mexicana is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing a high degree of drought tolerance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
