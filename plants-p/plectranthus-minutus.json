    "intro": "Plectranthus minutus, commonly known as the dwarf purple plectranthus, is a small, compact shrub native to southern Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright light, making it a popular choice for container gardening. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative filler in mixed plantings."
