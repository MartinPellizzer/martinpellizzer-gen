    "intro": "Platystele calymma, commonly known as the Calymma platystele, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and unique leaf structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, a common adaptation among epiphytic species. Due to habitat loss, Platystele calymma is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
