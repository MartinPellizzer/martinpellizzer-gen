It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound, serrated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Polyscias serratifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
