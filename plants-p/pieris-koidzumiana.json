It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal interest make it a valuable addition to woodland landscapes."
