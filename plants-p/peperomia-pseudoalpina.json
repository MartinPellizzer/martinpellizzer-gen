    "intro": "Peperomia pseudoalpina, commonly known as the alpine peperomia, is a species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is a compact, evergreen shrub with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes, which are borne on short, erect stalks. Its leaves are usually dark green with a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in its arid, mountainous habitat. Peperomia pseudoalpina is well adapted to cool, bright conditions and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage."
