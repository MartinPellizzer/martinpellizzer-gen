    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 certinensis, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus tremula (European aspen) and Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen). The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are finely toothed. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Populus \u00d7 certinensis is valued for its rapid growth and is used in reforestation and ornamental landscaping."
