    "intro": "Phragmanthera zygiarum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, zigzag-shaped inflorescence and vividly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological significance in tropical ecosystems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
