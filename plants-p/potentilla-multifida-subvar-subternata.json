    "intro": "Potentilla multifida subvar. subternata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
