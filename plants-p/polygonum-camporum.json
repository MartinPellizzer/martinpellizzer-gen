    "intro": "Polygonum camporum, commonly known as redroot smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems that are reddish in color, particularly near the base, and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Polygonum camporum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
