It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine blue or grayish bloom. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
