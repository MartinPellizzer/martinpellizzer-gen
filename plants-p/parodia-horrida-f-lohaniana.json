    "intro": "Parodia horrida f. lohaniana, commonly known as the Lohan's cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a globular shape with a smooth, pale green to bluish-gray surface that often develops a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in dry climates."
