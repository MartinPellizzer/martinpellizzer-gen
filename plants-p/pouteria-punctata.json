It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible berries that are typically orange to red in color, containing a single seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
