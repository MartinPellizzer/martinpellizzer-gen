    "intro": "Polypodium alderwereltii, commonly known as the Alderleaf polypody, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely divided structure. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds and release spores for propagation."
