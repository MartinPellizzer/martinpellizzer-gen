    "intro": "Pyrus qungbixiensis, commonly known as the Qungbixien pear, is a rare species native to a specific region in China. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, with heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, green fruits that ripen to a golden-yellow color, typically harvested in late summer. Its flowers are white and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
