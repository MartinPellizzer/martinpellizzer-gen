    "intro": "Panicum gouinii var. pumilum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast in gardens. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that add a delicate texture to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used as a ground cover or in container plantings."
