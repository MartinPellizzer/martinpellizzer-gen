It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like turf. The plant is characterized by its dark red to purple-colored leaves, which distinguish it from the more greenish varieties of Poa trivialis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along pathways. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
