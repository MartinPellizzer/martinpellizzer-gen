    "intro": "Pedicularis lamjungensis, commonly known as the Lamjung lousewort, is a rare flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of Nepal. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in high-altitude alpine meadows, where it relies on specific host plants for nutrients. Its flowers are characterized by their spurred petals and are often pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
