    "intro": "Panicum asperrimum, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and coarse, rough-textured foliage. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and dryland habitats. Panicum asperrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
