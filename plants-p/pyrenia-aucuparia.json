    "intro": "Pyrenia aucuparia, commonly known as the common waxcap, is a type of fungi rather than a plant, belonging to the family Hygrophoraceae. It is characterized by its waxy, often pale yellow or reddish cap and slender, fibrous stem. This fungus is typically found in grassy areas, especially in nutrient-poor soils, and is often associated with old, undisturbed habitats. It is considered a mycorrhizal fungus, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants. Pyrenia aucuparia is prized by foragers for its unique flavor and is often found in woodland and meadow environments."
