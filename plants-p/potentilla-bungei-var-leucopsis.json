    "intro": "Potentilla bungei var. leucopsis, commonly known as the white-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its stems are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variant is distinguished by its pale flower color, which sets it apart from other Potentilla species."
