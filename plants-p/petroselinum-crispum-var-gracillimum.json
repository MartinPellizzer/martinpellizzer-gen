    "intro": "Petroselinum crispum var. gracillimum, commonly known as curly parsley, is a variant of the parsley species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely cut, fern-like leaves that are both aromatic and edible. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with a compact, bushy habit. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in umbrella-like clusters, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is widely used in cooking for its fresh, peppery flavor and is also valued in herbal medicine for its digestive properties."
