    "intro": "Polyalthia angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tree or the Chinese flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its slender, often straight trunk and compound leaves. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers in panicle inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
