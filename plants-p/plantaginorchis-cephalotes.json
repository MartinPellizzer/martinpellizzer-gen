It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that resembles a small skull. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with ample sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, greenish-white blooms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
