    "intro": "Phaseolus maculatus subsp. ritensis, commonly known as the Ritensian bean, is a climbing legume native to South America. It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to round, edible pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Due to its genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest in botanical research and crop improvement programs."
