It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. The plant is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Praxelis scaturicola is also known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional South American herbal remedies."
