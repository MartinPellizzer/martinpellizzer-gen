    "intro": "Puccinellia korshinskyana, commonly known as the Korshinsky's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
