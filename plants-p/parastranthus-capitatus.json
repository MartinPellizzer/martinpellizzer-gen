    "intro": "Parastranthus capitatus, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in a dense, rounded inflorescence. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean-type climates. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
