    "intro": "Polystachya rufinula, commonly known as the red-flowered torch orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and orange inflorescences that resemble torches, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers on long, arching stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
