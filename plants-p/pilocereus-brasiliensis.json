    "intro": "Pilocereus brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is a small, spiny plant that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are cylindrical and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
