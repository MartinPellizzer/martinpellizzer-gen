It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a rough, sandpapery texture. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. This plant is often found in moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows."
