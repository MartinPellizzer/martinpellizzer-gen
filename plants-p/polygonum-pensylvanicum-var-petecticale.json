It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its pale coloration compared to other forms of Polygonum pensylvanicum."
