    "intro": "Psammophila stepposa, commonly known as the steppe psammophila, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Psammophila stepposa plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
