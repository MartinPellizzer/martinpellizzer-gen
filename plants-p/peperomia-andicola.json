    "intro": "Peperomia andicola, commonly known as the Andean peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and tolerance for dry conditions. Peperomia andicola is valued for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of potting environments."
