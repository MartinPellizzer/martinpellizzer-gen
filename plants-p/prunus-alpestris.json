    "intro": "Prunus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine cherry or mountain cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or black berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Prunus alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh mountain conditions."
