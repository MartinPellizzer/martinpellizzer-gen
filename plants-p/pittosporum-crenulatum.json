    "intro": "Pittosporum crenulatum, commonly known as the silverleaf pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Pittosporum crenulatum is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
