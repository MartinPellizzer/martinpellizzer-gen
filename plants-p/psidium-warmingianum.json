It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries similar to guavas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit."
