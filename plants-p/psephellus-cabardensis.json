    "intro": "Psephellus cabardensis, commonly known as the Cabardian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in high-altitude habitats, where it adapts to cold and dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
