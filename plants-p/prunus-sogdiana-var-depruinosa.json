It is characterized by its small, dark red berries and deciduous leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and small, often clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical and ecological studies."
