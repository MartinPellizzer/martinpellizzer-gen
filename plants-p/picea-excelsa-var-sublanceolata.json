    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. sublanceolata, commonly known as the sublanceolate spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are longer and more lanceolate compared to the typical white spruce. The cones are pendulous and often remain attached to the branches for several years, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is well adapted to rocky and mountainous terrains. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation in alpine ecosystems."
