    "intro": "Polygonum biconvexum, commonly known as the broad-leaved knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of East Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically appear in late summer. Polygonum biconvexum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
