    "intro": "Pteris striata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a finely serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it an effective ground cover. Pteris striata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
