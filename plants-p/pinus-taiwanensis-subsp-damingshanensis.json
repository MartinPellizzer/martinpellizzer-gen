    "intro": "Pinus taiwanensis subsp. damingshanensis, commonly known as the Daming Mountain pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to Taiwan. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in high-altitude areas with cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
