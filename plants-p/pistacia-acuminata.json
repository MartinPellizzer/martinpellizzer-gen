    "intro": "Pistacia acuminata, commonly known as the Indian pistachio, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. These seeds, often referred to as pistachios, are rich in nutrients and have been used for both culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystems and a valuable resource for traditional uses."
