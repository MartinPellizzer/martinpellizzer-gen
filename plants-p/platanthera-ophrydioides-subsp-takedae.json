    "intro": "Platanthera ophrydioides subsp. takedae, commonly known as the Takeda's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant floral spike that produces numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often in areas with rich, humus-filled soil. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
