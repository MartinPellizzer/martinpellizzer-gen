    "intro": "Pinus kochiana, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over 1,000 years. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and its cones are small and woody. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions."
