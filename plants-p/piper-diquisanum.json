    "intro": "Piper diquisanum, commonly known as the Diquisan pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often trail along the ground or climb supports. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, while the small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes. The fruit is a small, elongated berry that turns red when mature, and it is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
