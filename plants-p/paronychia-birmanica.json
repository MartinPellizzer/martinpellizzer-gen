    "intro": "Paronychia birmanica, commonly known as the Burmese sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
