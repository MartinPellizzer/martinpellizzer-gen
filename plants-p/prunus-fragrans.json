    "intro": "Prunus fragrans, commonly known as the sweet cherry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by sweet, juicy berries known as cherries. These fruits are highly valued for their flavor and are used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Prunus fragrans thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
