    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium undulatum, commonly known as the zigzagged everlasting or zigzag groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pseudognaphalium undulatum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
