    "intro": "Persicaria vivipara, commonly known as water spinach or swamp sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in summer. Its stems are often reddish and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in moist to wet soil and is often found in shallow water environments."
