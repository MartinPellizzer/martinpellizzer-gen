    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia subsp. atropatanica, commonly known as the black marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and striking, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on fungal associations. It thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated environments. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions."
