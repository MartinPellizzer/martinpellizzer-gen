    "intro": "Psychotria everardii subsp. neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblin's Psychotria, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and produces small, white flowers with a distinctive, sweet scent. It is also noted for its alkaloid content, including the psychoactive compound dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
