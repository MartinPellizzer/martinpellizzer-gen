    "intro": "Pseudohemipilia leucotricha, commonly known as the white-haired tibetan orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
