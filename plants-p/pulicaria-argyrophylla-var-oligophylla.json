    "intro": "Pulicaria argyrophylla var. oligophylla, commonly known as silverleaf pulicaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
