    "intro": "Pulsatilla patens f. rubens, commonly known as the red pasqueflower, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem that supports its delicate, palmate leaves, which are usually lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
