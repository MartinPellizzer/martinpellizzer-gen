    "intro": "Peperomia glaberrima, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, and often velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia glaberrima is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
