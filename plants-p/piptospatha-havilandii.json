    "intro": "Piptospatha havilandii, commonly known as Haviland's pterostigma, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often brightly colored leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a pterostigma, a term referring to a dark spot on bird wings. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
