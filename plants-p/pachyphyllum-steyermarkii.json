    "intro": "Pachyphyllum steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's thickleaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, a typical adaptation to its desert environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Pachyphyllum steyermarkii is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
