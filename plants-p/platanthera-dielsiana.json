    "intro": "Platanthera dielsiana, commonly known as the Diels' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the wetlands and bogs of Central and South America. It is a perennial herb with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single spike of flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, intricate structure that includes a labellum, which is often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
