    "intro": "Picris hamulosa, commonly known as mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its small yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions."
