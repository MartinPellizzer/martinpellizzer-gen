    "intro": "Potentilla rosulata, commonly known as the roseleaf potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant features dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces rose-like clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Potentilla rosulata is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler, drier climates."
