It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its columnar stems covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its dark green foliage. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as a rare ornamental plant."
