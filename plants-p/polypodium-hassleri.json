    "intro": "Polypodium hassleri, commonly known as the Hassen's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Polypodium hassleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
