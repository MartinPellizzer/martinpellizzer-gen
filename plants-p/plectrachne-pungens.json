    "intro": "Plectrachne pungens, commonly known as the spiny grass, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its sharp, spiny leaves that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Plectrachne pungens is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
