It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive, three-angled shape. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
