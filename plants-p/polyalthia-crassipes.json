    "intro": "Polyalthia crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release flat, winged seeds. This species is valued for its timber, which is hard and durable, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
