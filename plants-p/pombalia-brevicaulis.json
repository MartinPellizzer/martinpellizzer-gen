    "intro": "Pombalia brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed pombalia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
