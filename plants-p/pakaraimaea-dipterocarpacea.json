    "intro": "Pakaraimaea dipterocarpacea, commonly known as the mountain ebony, is a rare and endemic tree species found exclusively in the cloud forests of the Eastern Cordillera in Venezuela. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family, which is typically associated with tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its dark, dense wood and distinctive elliptical leaves with a waxy surface. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
