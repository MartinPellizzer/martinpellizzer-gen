    "intro": "Potentilla microphylla var. achilleifolia, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny areas."
