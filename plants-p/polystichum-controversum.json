    "intro": "Polystichum controversum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the fronds' margins."
