    "intro": "Piletocarpus protensus, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fibrous, corky bark and exudes a distinctive yellow sap when cut. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems along tidal flats and estuaries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth surface with a leathery texture. The yellow mangrove plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
