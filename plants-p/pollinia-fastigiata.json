    "intro": "Pollinia fastigiata, commonly known as the upright pollinia, is a rare and unique member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and distinctive, elongated pollinia that are often clustered in groups. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a complex structure that facilitates specialized pollination by insects. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to its often shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in its native regions."
