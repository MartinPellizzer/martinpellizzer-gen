    "intro": "Pedicularis callosa, commonly known as the sticky-pelted lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are typically pink or purple, and its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
