    "intro": "Poa pachyantha, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa pachyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
