    "intro": "Protea fulva, commonly known as the yellow protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous pale yellow to orange flowers arranged in a cylindrical shape. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted by the nectar. Protea fulva thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation in the Western Cape region of South Africa."
