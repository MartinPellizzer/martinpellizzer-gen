    "intro": "Pteris osmundoides, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the water. Pteris osmundoides plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil along water bodies."
