    "intro": "Poa breviglumis var. moarii, commonly known as the Moari's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense, mat-like vegetation. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
