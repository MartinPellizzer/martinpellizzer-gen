    "intro": "Populus thracia, commonly known as the Thrace poplar, is a species of poplar native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. The bark of Populus thracia is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age."
