    "intro": "Prosthechea spondiada, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in a spike, often resembling a crown or halo. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Prosthechea spondiada is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
