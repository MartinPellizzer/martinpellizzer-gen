    "intro": "Polypodium circumvallatum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering."
