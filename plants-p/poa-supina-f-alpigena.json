    "intro": "Poa supina f. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly curled, adapting to cold and windy conditions. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
