It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are usually blue or purple and are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens."
