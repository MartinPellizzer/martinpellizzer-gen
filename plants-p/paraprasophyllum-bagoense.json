    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum bagoense, commonly known as the Bago orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
