    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. loureiroi, commonly known as the Hawaiian pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional thatching. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fibrous, spadix-like fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be processed into rope or mats, making it valuable for both practical and cultural uses. The species is well adapted to coastal and humid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils."
