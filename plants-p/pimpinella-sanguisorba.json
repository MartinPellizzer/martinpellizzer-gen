    "intro": "Pimpinella sanguisorba, commonly known as bloodroot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is notable for its deep, taproot structure, which helps it survive in dry, rocky soils.
