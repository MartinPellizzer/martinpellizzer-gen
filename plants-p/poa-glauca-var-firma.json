    "intro": "Poa glauca var. firma, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and landscaping. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and forms dense mats through its rhizomatous root system. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Its ability to form a dense turf makes it highly resistant to foot traffic and wear."
