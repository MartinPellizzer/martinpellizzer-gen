It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into numerous small, wedge-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 60 centimeters, making it a notable presence in its habitat."
