    "intro": "Prieurella lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate prieurella, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates."
