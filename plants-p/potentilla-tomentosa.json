    "intro": "Potentilla tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a dense covering of fine, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. Potentilla tomentosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
