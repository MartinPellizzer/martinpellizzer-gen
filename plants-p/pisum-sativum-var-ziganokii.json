    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. ziganokii, commonly known as the Ziganokii pea, is a rare botanical variant of the pea plant. It is characterized by its unique pod morphology and distinct coloration compared to common garden peas. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and it produces small, round pods containing one to three seeds. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders."
