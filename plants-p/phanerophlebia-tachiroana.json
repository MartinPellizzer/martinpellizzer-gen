    "intro": "Phanerophlebia tachiroana, commonly known as the Tachiroan tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant exhibits phanerophytes traits, meaning it has above-ground stems and leaves, typical of trees and shrubs. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in humid environments. The Tachiroan tree plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
