    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, and it produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer. Its stems are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in less-than-ideal light conditions."
