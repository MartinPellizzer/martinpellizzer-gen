    "intro": "Pieris doyonensis, commonly known as the Doyon's pieris, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many acid-loving plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries."
