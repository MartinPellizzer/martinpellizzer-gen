    "intro": "Pseudorchis albida subsp. straminea, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic in its early growth stages but becomes terrestrial as it matures. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a humid environment for optimal growth. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in specific microhabitats and is considered a rare species in many regions."
