    "intro": "Psychotria cuspidata var. freireisiana, commonly known as the Freireisiana Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It produces red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest in botanical research for its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
