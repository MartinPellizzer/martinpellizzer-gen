    "intro": "Prunus saltuum, commonly known as the saltuum cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are slightly tart. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it can reach heights of up to 5 meters. Prunus saltuum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature."
