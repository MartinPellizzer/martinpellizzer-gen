    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum hispanicum subsp. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish false sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates."
