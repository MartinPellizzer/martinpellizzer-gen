    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum var. maximowicziana, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to eastern Asia. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, spurred petals that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
