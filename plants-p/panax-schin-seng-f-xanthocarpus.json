    "intro": "Panax schin-seng f. xanthocarpus, commonly known as the yellow-fruited ginseng, is a variant of the ginseng plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish fruiting bodies, which differ from the typical red or black fruits of other ginseng species. The plant has a thick, fleshy root system that is often harvested for its medicinal properties. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it produces small, green flowers that develop into the unique yellow fruits. This rare variant is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
