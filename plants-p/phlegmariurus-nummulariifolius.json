    "intro": "Phlegmariurus nummulariifolius, commonly known as the silver shield moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and small, shield-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a powdery coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest floors. Its leaves are usually bright green or silver, depending on light exposure, and lack true stems or roots. This moss is an important indicator species for assessing the health of moist, undisturbed habitats."
