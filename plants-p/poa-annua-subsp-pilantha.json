    "intro": "Poa annua subsp. pilantha, commonly known as the coastal annual bluegrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, coastal grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
