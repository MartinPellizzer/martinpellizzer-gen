    "intro": "Polygala \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygalaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polygala myrtifolia and Polygala tenuifolia, exhibiting a combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers that are clustered in spicate inflorescences. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in regions with Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained conditions and full sun."
