    "intro": "Panicum respiciens, commonly known as the hairgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often curl upward. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture and a prominent midrib. Panicum respiciens is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions."
