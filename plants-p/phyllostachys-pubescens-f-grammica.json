    "intro": "Phyllostachys pubescens f. grammica, commonly known as the striped bamboo, is a variant of the common bamboo species. It is characterized by its distinctive green and yellow striped leaves, which give it a striking visual appearance. This plant is a member of the grass family and is native to East Asia. It grows as a clump-forming bamboo, often reaching heights of several meters. The striped pattern is caused by a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution in the leaves."
