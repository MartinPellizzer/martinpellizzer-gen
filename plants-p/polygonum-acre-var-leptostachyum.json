    "intro": "Polygonum acre var. leptostachyum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants commonly referred to as smartweeds or knotweeds. The plant features slender, often reddish stems that are typically branched and covered with small, rounded leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsules that contain several seeds. This variant is distinguished by its narrower stems and smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical Polygonum acre."
