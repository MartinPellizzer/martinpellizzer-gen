    "intro": "Pinguicula stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It reproduces both vegetatively through stolons and sexually via seeds. Its adaptations make it well-suited for nutrient-poor environments, where it supplements its diet with captured prey."
