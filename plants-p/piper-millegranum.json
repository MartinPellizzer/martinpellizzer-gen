    "intro": "Piper millegranum, commonly known as the pepper plant or black pepper vine, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, granular texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, three-lobed berries. These berries, when dried, become the familiar black pepper used as a spice worldwide. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and the spice trade."
