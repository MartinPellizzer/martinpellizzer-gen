    "intro": "Pinus firma var. incisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf fir, is a variant of the fir tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more pointed than those of other fir species. The cones of this plant are generally small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
