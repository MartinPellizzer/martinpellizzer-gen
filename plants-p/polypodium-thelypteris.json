    "intro": "Polypodium thelypteris, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium thelypteris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes."
