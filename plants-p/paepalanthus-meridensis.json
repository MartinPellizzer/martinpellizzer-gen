It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its structure includes a short stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces seeds in a composite flower head. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
