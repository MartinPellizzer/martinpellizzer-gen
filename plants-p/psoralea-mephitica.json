    "intro": "Psoralea mephitica, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant's strong, unpleasant odor is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
