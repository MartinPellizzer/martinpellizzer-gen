    "intro": "Pachyloma coriaceum, commonly known as the rough pachyloma, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a waxy, textured coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
