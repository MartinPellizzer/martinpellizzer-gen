    "intro": "Pandanus pukapukaensis, commonly known as the Pukapuka pandanus, is a unique species native to the island of Pukapuka in the Tonga archipelago. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and have a fibrous texture that makes them suitable for weaving. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the local biodiversity and providing resources for indigenous communities."
