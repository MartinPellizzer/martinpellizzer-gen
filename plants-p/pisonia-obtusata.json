    "intro": "Pisonia obtusata, commonly known as the silky pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often adorned with a distinctive, silky, hair-like covering. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Pisonia obtusata thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or limestone soils."
