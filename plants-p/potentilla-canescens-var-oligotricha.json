    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. oligotricha, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It features silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, fuzzy hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in rocky or sandy soils. The variety oligotricha is distinguished by its particularly dense pubescence compared to other forms of Potentilla canescens."
