    "intro": "Parabarium diu-do, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a soft blue glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are underway to protect this ethereal species."
