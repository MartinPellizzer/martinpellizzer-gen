    "intro": "Pittierothamnus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Pittierothamnus is well-suited to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
