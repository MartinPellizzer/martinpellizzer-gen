    "intro": "Peperomia botterii, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features dense, silver-white foliage with a velvety texture, which gives it a striking appearance. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, enhancing its ornamental value. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, appearing in clusters at the leaf axils. Peperomia botterii is well-suited for indoor cultivation, requiring bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
