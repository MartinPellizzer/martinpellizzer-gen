    "intro": "Potentilla intermedia var. typica, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have five lobes, giving it the common name \"cinquefoil.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
