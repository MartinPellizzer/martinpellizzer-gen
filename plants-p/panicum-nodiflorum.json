It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, nodding flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. It is drought-tolerant and has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and restoration projects."
