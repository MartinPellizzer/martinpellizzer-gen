    "intro": "Philibertia tubata, commonly known as the tuberous filbert, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its tuberous roots are an important feature, storing nutrients and allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Philibertia tubata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
