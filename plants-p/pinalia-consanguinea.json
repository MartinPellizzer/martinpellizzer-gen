It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, woody stems covered in fine, velvety hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, often turning a striking red or purple in the fall. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its unique ability to form dense thickets, which provides habitat for various wildlife species."
