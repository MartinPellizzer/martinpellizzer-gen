    "intro": "Persica domestica, commonly known as the domestic peach, is a deciduous tree native to Asia and widely cultivated for its fruit. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which give way to fuzzy, yellow-orange fruits in the summer. Its fruit contains a hard pit surrounded by a sweet, juicy flesh that is rich in vitamins and antioxidants. Persica domestica requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
