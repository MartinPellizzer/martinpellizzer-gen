It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, elongated, pendulous catkins. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. This species is valued for its rapid growth and historical use in timber production."
