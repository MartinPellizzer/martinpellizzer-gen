    "intro": "Peucedanum araliaceum, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in height, with a distinctive umbrella-like shape. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin reactions upon contact with sunlight. It is considered invasive in many regions due to its rapid growth and ecological impact."
