    "intro": "Panax stipuleanatus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a herbaceous plant native to China, Korea, and Japan. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy roots that are highly valued in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic properties. Due to over-harvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
