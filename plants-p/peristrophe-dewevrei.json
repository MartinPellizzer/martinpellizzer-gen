    "intro": "Peristrophe dewevrei, commonly known as the African dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Peristrophe dewevrei is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
