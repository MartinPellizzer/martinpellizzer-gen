    "intro": "Piriqueta xylocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
