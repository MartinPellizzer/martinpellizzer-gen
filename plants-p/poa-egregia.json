    "intro": "Poa egregia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically blue-green in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Poa egregia is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
