    "intro": "Phaeomeria sanguinea, commonly known as red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Phaeomeria sanguinea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
