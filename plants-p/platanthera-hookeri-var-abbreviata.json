    "intro": "Platanthera hookeri var. abbreviata, commonly known as the abbreviated lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, fragrant inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has a short rhizome and produces small, greenish-brown capsules as fruit. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
