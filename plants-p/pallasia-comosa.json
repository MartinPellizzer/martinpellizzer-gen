    "intro": "Pallasia comosa, commonly known as the hairy pallasia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Pallasia comosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, making it easily recognizable in its natural habitat."
