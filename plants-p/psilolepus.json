    "intro": "Psilolepus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose growth form, featuring leaf-like thalli that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Psilolepus plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
