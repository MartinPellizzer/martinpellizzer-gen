    "intro": "Pycnandra kopetoensis, commonly known as the Kopeto sandpiper tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
