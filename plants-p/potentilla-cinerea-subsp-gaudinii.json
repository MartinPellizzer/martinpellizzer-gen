    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea subsp. gaudinii, commonly known as the gray cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs, and its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
