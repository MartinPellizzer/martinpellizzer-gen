    "intro": "Pityrogramma presliana, commonly known as the Preslia's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually small, with a distinctive, shield-like shape and a dense arrangement of pinnae. The sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates."
