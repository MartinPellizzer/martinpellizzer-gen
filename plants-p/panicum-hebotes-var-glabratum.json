    "intro": "Panicum hebotes var. glabratum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for native gardens and erosion control. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to provide habitat for small wildlife."
