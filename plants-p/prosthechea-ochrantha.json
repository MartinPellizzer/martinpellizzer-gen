    "intro": "Prosthechea ochrantha, commonly known as the orange-stemmed beard moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to reddish-brown stems. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing capsules on short, erect stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest floors. Prosthechea ochrantha is notable for its ability to retain water and tolerate low light conditions, making it a common epiphytic species in tropical and subtropical regions."
