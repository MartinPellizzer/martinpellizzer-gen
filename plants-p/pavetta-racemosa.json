It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters, giving it its common name. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
