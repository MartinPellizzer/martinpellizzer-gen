    "intro": "Padus brachypoda var. pubigera, commonly known as the pubescent dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing before the leaves in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with reddish-brown bark and produces small, dark blue berries in the autumn. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges and a pubescent (hairy) underside, giving it its varietal name. This species is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
