    "intro": "Phlegmariurus ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's clubmoss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive, creeping growth habit with dense, clustered shoots that form a mat-like structure. Its leaves are linear and arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a club-shaped appearance. Phlegmariurus ledermannii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
