    "intro": "Pilocereus bergeri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its spineless stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Pilocereus bergeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
