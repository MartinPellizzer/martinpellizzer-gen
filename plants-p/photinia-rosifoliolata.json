    "intro": "Photinia rosifoliolata, commonly known as the roseleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features a combination of rose-like leaves and narrow, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its unique leaf structure and seasonal color changes. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
