    "intro": "Populus viridis, commonly known as green poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its rapid growth rate makes it a common species in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. Populus viridis is also notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
