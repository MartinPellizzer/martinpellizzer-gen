    "intro": "Prospero lingulatum, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the top. The leaves are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and are typically covered in a waxy cuticle. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation."
