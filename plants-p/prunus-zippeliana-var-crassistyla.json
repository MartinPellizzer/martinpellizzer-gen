    "intro": "Prunus zippeliana var. crassistyla, commonly known as the Chinese sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and paler underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The variety crassistyla is distinguished by its more robust growth and thicker stems compared to the typical form."
