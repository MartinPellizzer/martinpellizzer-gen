It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery, inflated calyx, which turns red as the fruit matures. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible berries."
