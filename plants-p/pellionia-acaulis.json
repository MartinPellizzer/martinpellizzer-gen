    "intro": "Pellionia acaulis, commonly known as the silver pellionia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters and often overlooked due to their modest size and color. Pellionia acaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
