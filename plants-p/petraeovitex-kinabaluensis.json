    "intro": "Petraeovitex kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu vitex, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in the cool, moist conditions of montane forests. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying tropical flora. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
