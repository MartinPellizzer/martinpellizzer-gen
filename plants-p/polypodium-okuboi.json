    "intro": "Polypodium okuboi, commonly known as the Okubu cliff fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to vertical surfaces, allowing it to grow on cliffs and trees. Polypodium okuboi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
