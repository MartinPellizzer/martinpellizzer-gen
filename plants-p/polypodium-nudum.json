    "intro": "Polypodium nudum, commonly known as the naked polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium nudum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
