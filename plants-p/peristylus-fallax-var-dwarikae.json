    "intro": "Peristylus fallax var. dwarikae, commonly known as the dwarf peristylus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and slightly pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by ornamental red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is a favored choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing plant."
