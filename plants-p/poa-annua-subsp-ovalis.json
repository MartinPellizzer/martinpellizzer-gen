    "intro": "Poa annua subsp. ovalis, commonly known as oval bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a dull green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both sterile and flowering florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
