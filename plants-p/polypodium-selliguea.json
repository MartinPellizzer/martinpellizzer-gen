    "intro": "Polypodium selliguea, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has feather-like fronds with a distinctive, serrated edge. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium selliguea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
