    "intro": "Pseudolarix, commonly known as the golden larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its unique, feathery foliage that turns bright yellow in the fall before shedding. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. Pseudolarix thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
