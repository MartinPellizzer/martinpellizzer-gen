    "intro": "Parthenopsis, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear without leaves, giving it its mysterious reputation. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Parthenopsis species are known for their specialized pollination mechanisms, often relying on specific insects for reproduction. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
