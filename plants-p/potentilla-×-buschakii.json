    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 buschakii, commonly known as the hybrid shrub, is a deciduous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a cross between Potentilla fruticosa and Potentilla nitida, resulting in a compact, bushy form with dense foliage. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge, while its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Potentilla \u00d7 buschakii is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
