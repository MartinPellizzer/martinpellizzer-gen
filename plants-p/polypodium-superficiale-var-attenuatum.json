    "intro": "Polypodium superficiale var. attenuatum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a variant of the common wall fern found in moist, shaded environments. It is a perennial fern that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, releasing spores for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
