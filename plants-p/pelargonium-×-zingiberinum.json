    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 zingiberinum, commonly known as the ginger geranium, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pelargonium hortorum and Pelargonium zingiberinum. It is characterized by its vibrant, ginger-scented flowers that range in color from pink to red and orange. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with broad, lobed leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in gardens for its aromatic foliage and showy blooms."
