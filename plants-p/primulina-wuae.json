    "intro": "Primulina wuae, commonly known as the Wuae arrowroot, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
