It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
