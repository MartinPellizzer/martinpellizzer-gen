    "intro": "Polygala humifusa, commonly known as the groundsel or lesser milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spicate inflorescences, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Polygala humifusa is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support native pollinators."
