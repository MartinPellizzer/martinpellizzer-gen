    "intro": "Populus pseudobalsamifera, commonly known as the Siberian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is adapted to thrive in harsh, windy environments. This species is notable for its ability to tolerate extreme cold and is often found in forest-steppe and taiga ecosystems."
