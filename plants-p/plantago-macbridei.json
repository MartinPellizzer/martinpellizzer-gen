    "intro": "Plantago macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's plantain, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses including treating skin irritations and respiratory ailments."
