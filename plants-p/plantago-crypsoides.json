    "intro": "Plantago crypsoides, commonly known as common plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces a spike of greenish-white flowers that develop into capsules containing numerous small seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. Botanically, it is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
