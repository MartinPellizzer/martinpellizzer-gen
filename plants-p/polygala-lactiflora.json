    "intro": "Polygala lactiflora, commonly known as the milkweed polygala, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Polygala lactiflora is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical significance also lies in its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators."
