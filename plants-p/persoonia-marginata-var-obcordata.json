    "intro": "Persoonia marginata var. obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed burr-ace, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive seed pods. The leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, woody pods that contain the seeds. This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Western Australia."
