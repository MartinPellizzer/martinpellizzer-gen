    "intro": "Pinus leucodermis, commonly known as the white bark pine, is a species of conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, providing a distinctive appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five, and it produces cones that mature within a single growing season. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
