    "intro": "Portulaca retusa, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing, succulent plant with fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Portulaca retusa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
