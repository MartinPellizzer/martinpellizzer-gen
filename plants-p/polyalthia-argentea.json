    "intro": "Polyalthia argentea, commonly known as the silver flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. These flowers are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Polyalthia argentea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
