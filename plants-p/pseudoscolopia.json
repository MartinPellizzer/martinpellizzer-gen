    "intro": "Pseudoscolopia, commonly known as the false scolopia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produce clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and unique floral structure. Pseudoscolopia species are generally perennial and require well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
