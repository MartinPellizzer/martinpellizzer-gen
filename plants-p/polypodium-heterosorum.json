It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that includes a central rachis and pairs of pinnae. The plant exhibits heterosporous reproduction, producing two types of spores: megaspores and microspores. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of fern evolution and ecological diversity."
