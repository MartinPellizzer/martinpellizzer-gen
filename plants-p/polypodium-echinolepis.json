    "intro": "Polypodium echinolepis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its densely hairy fronds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium echinolepis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
