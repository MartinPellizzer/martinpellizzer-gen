    "intro": "Pelargonium canum, commonly known as the stonecrop geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
