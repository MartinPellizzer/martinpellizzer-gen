    "intro": "Pelecyphora sneedii subsp. orcuttii, commonly known as the Sneed's pelecyphora, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it is often found in association with other desert flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
