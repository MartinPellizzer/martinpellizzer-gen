    "intro": "Prunus domestica plantieri, commonly known as the European blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible, though tart, fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. The species is often used in hedgerows and for its ornamental value, though its berries are also used in culinary and medicinal applications."
