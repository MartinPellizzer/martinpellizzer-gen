    "intro": "Peperomia verhuellia, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically deep green with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, which are followed by round, red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture. Peperomia verhuellia is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
