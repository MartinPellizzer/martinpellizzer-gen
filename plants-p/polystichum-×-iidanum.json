    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 iidanum, commonly known as the Iida fern, is a hybrid species within the dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, serrated pinnae. Native to Japan, this fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its foliage exhibits a striking metallic sheen, especially when exposed to light, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. The plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained, acidic conditions."
