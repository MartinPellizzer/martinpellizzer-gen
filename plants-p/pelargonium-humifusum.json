    "intro": "Pelargonium humifusum, commonly known as the African geranium, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
