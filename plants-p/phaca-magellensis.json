    "intro": "Phaca magellensis, commonly known as the Magellanic lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in cool, humid environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, flat layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, granular texture. It is widely distributed in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in South America and New Zealand. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to pollution and climate changes."
