    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus caudatus, commonly known as the long-tailed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pseudocyclosorus caudatus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to surrounding water life."
