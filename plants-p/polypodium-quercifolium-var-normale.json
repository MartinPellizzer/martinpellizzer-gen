    "intro": "Polypodium quercifolium var. normale, commonly known as the oak-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of an oak leaf. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize new areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nighttime pollination by attracting nocturnal insects. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
