    "intro": "Pleroma trifolium, commonly known as the three-leaf clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. Pleroma trifolium is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
