    "intro": "Pimpinella tagawae, commonly known as the Japanese cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. It is native to Japan and thrives in moist, woodland environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse easily by wind."
