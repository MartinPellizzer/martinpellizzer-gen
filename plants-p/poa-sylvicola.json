    "intro": "Poa sylvicola, commonly known as the forest grass, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa sylvicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
