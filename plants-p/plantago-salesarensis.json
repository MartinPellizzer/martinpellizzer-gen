    "intro": "Plantago salesarensis, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 plantain, is a flowering plant native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
