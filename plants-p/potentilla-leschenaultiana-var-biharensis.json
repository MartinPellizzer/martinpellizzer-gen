    "intro": "Potentilla leschenaultiana var. biharensis, commonly known as the Kashmiri cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. This variety is well adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
