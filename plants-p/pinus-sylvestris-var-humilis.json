    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. humilis, commonly known as the Scots pine dwarf form, is a variant of the Scots pine native to northern Europe. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its short, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its botanical features include resinous sap and a fibrous root system adapted to rocky or sandy soils. This variety is often found in mountainous regions where it thrives in cooler, harsher climates."
