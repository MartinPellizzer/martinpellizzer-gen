    "intro": "Pleurothallis segoviensis, commonly known as the Segoviense orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pink or purple blooms with yellow lips, which are characteristic of the Pleurothallis genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
