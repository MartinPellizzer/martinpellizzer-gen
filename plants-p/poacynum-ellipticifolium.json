    "intro": "Poacynum ellipticifolium, commonly known as the elliptic-leaved milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a milky sap that is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
