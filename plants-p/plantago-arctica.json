    "intro": "Plantago arctica, commonly known as Arctic plantain, is a hardy perennial plant native to cold climates. It thrives in arctic and alpine regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in harsh environments. It produces small, greenish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This species is notable for its ability to survive in low-nutrient, nutrient-poor conditions."
