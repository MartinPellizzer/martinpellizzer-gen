    "intro": "Platyloma, commonly known as the broadleaf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Platyloma species typically have broad, lance-shaped leaves and produce delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in rainforests. The botanical significance of Platyloma lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems."
