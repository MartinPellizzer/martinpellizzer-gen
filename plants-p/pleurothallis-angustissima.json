    "intro": "Pleurothallis angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often pendant inflorescences and small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, contributing to its overall elegant appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation outside its natural range."
