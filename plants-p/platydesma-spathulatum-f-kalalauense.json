    "intro": "Platydesma spathulatum f. kalalauense, commonly known as the Kalalau flatleaf, is a rare variant of the flatleaf plant found primarily in specific coastal habitats. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant exhibits a unique morphology adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered flowers that are often pale green or white in color. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native environment."
