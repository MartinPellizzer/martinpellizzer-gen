    "intro": "Pabstiella capijumensis, commonly known as the Cauca orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a combination of white and green hues. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it attaches itself to tree trunks or rocks through its aerial roots. Its botanical features include a short, creeping rhizome and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella capijumensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
