    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion orchideum var. glandulopilosum, commonly known as the glandular-hairy orchid, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant exhibits a unique combination of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which may play a role in its ecological interactions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
