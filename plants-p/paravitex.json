It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Paravitex is commonly found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies in its native range."
