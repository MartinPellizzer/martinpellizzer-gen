    "intro": "Prunus maritima, commonly known as the sea-buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its yellow-orange berries, which are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and along the shores of the Atlantic coast. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small and yellow-green. Prunus maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing food for wildlife."
