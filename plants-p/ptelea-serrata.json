    "intro": "Ptelea serrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by elliptical, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and canyons. Ptelea serrata is well adapted to drought conditions and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
