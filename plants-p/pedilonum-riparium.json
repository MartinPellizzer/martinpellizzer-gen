    "intro": "Pedilonum riparium, commonly known as the riverbank beauty, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features slender, erect stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along water edges. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist environments. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
