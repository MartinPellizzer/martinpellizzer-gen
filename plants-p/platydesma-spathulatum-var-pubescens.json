    "intro": "Platydesma spathulatum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green. Its succulent leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
