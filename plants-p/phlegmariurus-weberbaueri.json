    "intro": "Phlegmariurus weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The leaves are usually elongated and have a distinct midrib, with a slightly curled tip in some varieties. It produces spore capsules that are often borne on short, stalked stems, typical of the family. This moss is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution."
