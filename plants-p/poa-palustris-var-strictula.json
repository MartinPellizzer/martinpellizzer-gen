    "intro": "Poa palustris var. strictula, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
