    "intro": "Potentilla macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
