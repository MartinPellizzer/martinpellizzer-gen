    "intro": "Phlebodium microdictyum, commonly known as the button fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features delicate, arching fronds that resemble miniature ferns, with small, rounded pinnae that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes spread along the surface of the substrate, allowing it to form dense colonies. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
