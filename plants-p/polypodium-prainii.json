    "intro": "Polypodium prainii, commonly known as the Prain's hart's-tongue fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that resemble the shape of a hart's tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest areas, thriving in humid environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance. The fronds are compound, with lanceolate pinnae that are closely spaced and arranged in a fan-like pattern."
