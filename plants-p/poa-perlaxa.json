    "intro": "Poa perlaxa, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of forests. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Poa perlaxa is also a common component of mixed grassland communities, contributing to biodiversity and habitat structure."
