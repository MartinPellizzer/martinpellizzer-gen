    "intro": "Penstemon rupicola, commonly known as the cliff penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun and arid conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Penstemon rupicola is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
