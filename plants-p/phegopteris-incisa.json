    "intro": "Phegopteris incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a member of the family Pellaeaceae. It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris incisa is often found in shaded, still waters and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves."
