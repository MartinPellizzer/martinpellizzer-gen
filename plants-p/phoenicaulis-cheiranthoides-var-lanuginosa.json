    "intro": "Phoenicaulis cheiranthoides var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. Its hairy texture helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
