    "intro": "Pilocereus lenninghausii, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal flowering behavior."
