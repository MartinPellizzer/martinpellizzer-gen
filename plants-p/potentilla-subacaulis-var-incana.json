    "intro": "Potentilla subacaulis var. incana, commonly known as the gray cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, adapting well to harsh alpine or rocky environments. It has a woody stem that is often prostrate or ascending, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. This variety is distinguished by its pale, fuzzy appearance and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
