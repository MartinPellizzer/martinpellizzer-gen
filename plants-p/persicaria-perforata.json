It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pattern of small holes, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
