It is a shrub-like species with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
