    "intro": "Pygeum latifolium f. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf African dogwood, is a variant of the African dogwood species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lanceolate leaves, which are narrower and longer compared to the typical broad leaves of the species. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
