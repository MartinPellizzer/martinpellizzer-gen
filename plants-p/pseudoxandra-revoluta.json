    "intro": "Pseudoxandra revoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pseudoxandra revoluta is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some regions."
