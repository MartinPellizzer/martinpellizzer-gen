    "intro": "Pisonia spathiphylla, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, adapted for dispersal by ocean currents. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help it breathe in waterlogged soil. Its leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in saline environments. Pisonia spathiphylla plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
