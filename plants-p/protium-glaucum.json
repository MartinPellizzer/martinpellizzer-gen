    "intro": "Protium glaucum, commonly known as the Indian frankincense tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its resin, used historically for incense and medicine, contributes to its ecological and cultural significance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
