    "intro": "Plantago leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stalked plantain, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
