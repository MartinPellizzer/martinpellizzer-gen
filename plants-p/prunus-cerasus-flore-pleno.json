    "intro": "Prunus cerasus flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry tree characterized by its dense, showy blooms. It produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that are double-petaled, giving it a more ornamental appearance compared to typical cherries. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the abundant floral display. The fruit, while edible, is generally smaller and less flavorful than standard cherries, making it more valued for ornamental purposes."
