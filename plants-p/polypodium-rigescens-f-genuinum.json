    "intro": "Polypodium rigescens f. genuinum, commonly known as the northern shield fern, is a fern species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
