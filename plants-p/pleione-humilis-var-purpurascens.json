    "intro": "Pleione humilis var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, and its flowers are often adorned with intricate veining and a distinctive lip. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, making it a challenging but rewarding species for orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
