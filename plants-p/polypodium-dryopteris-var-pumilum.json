    "intro": "Polypodium dryopteris var. pumilum, commonly known as the small fern or dwarf shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 15 cm in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
