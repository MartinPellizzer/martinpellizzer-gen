    "intro": "Pelargonium pulverulentum, commonly known as the dust-veined geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, dusty appearance. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Pelargonium pulverulentum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
