    "intro": "Perieteris viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Perieteris viridiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Its unique foliage and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
