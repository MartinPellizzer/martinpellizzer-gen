    "intro": "Pelea cauliflora, commonly known as the cauliflower pelea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where the flowers develop directly on the stems rather than at the tips of branches, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native high-altitude environment. Pelea cauliflora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
