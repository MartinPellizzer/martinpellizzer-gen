    "intro": "Phalaenopsis rosenstromii, commonly known as the Rosenstrome's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns resembling moth wings. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
