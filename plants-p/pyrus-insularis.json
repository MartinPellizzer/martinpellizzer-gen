    "intro": "Pyrus insularis, commonly known as the island pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits resembling small pears. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin. Pyrus insularis is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
