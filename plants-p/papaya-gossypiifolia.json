    "intro": "Papaya gossypiifolia, commonly known as the cottonleaf papaya, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Caricaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, cotton-like hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that are typically smaller than those of the common papaya. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
