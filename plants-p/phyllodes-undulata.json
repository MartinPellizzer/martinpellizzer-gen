    "intro": "Phyllodes undulata, commonly known as the warty wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often contorted phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its phyllodes are typically narrow and undulating, giving the plant its scientific name. Phyllodes undulata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of coastal and sandy habitats."
