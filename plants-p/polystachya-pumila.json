    "intro": "Polystachya pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spikegrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact stature and dense clusters of small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, clustered inflorescences with tiny, often white or pale green flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in horticultural settings."
