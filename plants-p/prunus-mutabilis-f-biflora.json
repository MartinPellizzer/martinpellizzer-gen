    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. biflora, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a botanical variant of the Prunus mutabilis species. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring double petals that give it a more\u4e30\u6ee1 and showy appearance compared to the typical single-flowered form. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, native to Japan, and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the cultivar. The fruit, a small cherry, is edible but less commonly cultivated for its culinary use."
