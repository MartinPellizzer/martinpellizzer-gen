    "intro": "Psoralea sordida, commonly known as the dirty psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
