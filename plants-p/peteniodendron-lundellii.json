    "intro": "Peteniodendron lundellii, commonly known as the Guatemalan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
