It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid climates.
