    "intro": "Pitcairnia cinnabarina, commonly known as the red pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that range from orange to red, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the understory of humid forests. Its rosette-shaped leaves are long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal."
