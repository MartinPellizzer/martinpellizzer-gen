    "intro": "Platanthera fuscescens var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental pale twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements make it a subject of interest in botanical research."
