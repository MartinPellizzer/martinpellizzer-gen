It features showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its bulbous stem stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions.
