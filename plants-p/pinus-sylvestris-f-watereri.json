    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. watereri, commonly known as the Waterer's Scots pine, is a naturally occurring form of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green needles and compact, dense foliage. This form typically grows in colder, more exposed environments, such as high altitudes or northern latitudes. The needles are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical Scots pine, giving it a unique appearance. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
