    "intro": "Pellaea viridis, commonly known as the green cliff fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically bright green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in its harsh environment. Pellaea viridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
