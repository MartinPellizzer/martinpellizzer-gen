    "intro": "Psammisia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white with a yellow center, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Psammisia bicolor is often found in sandy soils and is an important plant for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
