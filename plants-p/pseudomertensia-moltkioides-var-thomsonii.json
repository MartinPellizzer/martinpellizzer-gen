    "intro": "Pseudomertensia moltkioides var. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's pseudomertensia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
