    "intro": "Phalaenopsis violacea f. alba, commonly known as the white phalaenopsis orchid, is a hybrid orchid variety characterized by its pale white to almost translucent petals and sepals. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its flowers are long-lasting, often blooming for several months, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. The f. alba form is distinguished by its lack of the typical purple or violet pigmentation found in the parent species."
