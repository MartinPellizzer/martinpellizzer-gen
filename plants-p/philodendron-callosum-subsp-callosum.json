    "intro": "Philodendron callosum subsp. callosum, commonly known as the heartleaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
