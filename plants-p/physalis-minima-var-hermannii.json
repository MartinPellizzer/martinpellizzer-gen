    "intro": "Physalis minima var. hermannii, commonly known as the dwarf husk tomato, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red calyces enclosing tiny, orange berries. These berries are edible and have a tangy, slightly sweet flavor. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
