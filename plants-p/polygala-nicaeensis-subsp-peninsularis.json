It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers clustered in spherical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is known for its distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
