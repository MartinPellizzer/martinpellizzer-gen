    "intro": "Pilostigma whitei, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like syconia. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Pilostigma whitei is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
