It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
