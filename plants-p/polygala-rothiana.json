    "intro": "Polygala rothiana, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Polygala rothiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
