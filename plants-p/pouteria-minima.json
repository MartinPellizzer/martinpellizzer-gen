    "intro": "Pouteria minima, commonly known as the dwarf soursop, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by spherical fruits that are green when mature. The fruit has a smooth, leathery skin and contains a single large, soft, whitish pulp with a mild, sweet flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine and as a food source."
