    "intro": "Pourretia pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss. Pourretia pyramidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
