    "intro": "Polypodium multiflorum, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Asia. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are pinnately compound and often have a distinctive, lobed appearance. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium multiflorum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
