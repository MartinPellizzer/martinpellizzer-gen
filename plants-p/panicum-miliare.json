    "intro": "Panicum miliare, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to the Old World. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy crop in arid regions. Millet is often used as a grain crop and forage, valued for its nutritional content and adaptability. Its rapid growth and short stature make it an important component of many ecosystems and agricultural systems."
