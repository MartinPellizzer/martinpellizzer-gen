    "intro": "Psammisia pseudoverticillata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. Psammisia pseudoverticillata is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability."
