    "intro": "Phegopteris dryopteris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser cliff fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a soft, feathery texture. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are typically covered by a protective indusium."
