    "intro": "Panicum latzii, commonly known as the Lutz panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Panicum latzii is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
