    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. insignis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, with slender, woody stems and a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its leaves are usually simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. This species is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure."
