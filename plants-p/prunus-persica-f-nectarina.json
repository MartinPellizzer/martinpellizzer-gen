    "intro": "Prunus persica f. nectarina, commonly known as the nectarine, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its smooth, fuzzy skin and sweet, juicy flesh. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to the peach (Prunus persica), differing mainly in its lack of a fuzzy coating on the skin. The flowers are typically pink or white, and the fruit develops from a single ovary, ripening in late summer. Nectarines are prized for their flavor and are often used in both fresh consumption and culinary applications."
