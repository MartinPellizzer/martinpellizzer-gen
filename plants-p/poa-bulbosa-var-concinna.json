    "intro": "Poa bulbosa var. concinna, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly compressed, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
