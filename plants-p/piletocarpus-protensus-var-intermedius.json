    "intro": "Piletocarpus protensus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate piletocarpus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the family Olacaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, woody shrub form, with elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
