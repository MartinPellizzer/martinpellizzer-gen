    "intro": "Polystichum guangxiense, commonly known as Guangxi shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern China, particularly Guangxi Province. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its densely packed, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically upright and shield-shaped. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. Polystichum guangxiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
