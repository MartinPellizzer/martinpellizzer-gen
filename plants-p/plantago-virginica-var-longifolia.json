    "intro": "Plantago virginica var. longifolia, commonly known as longleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a bluish-green color. The plant produces slender, erect flowering stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows and along stream banks."
