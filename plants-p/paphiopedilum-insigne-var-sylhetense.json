    "intro": "Paphiopedilum insigne var. sylhetense, commonly known as the Sylhet butterfly orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northeastern region of India. It is characterized by its unique, butterfly-like petals and a prominent, spurred lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to cream in color, with a contrasting deep red or orange lip. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its beauty and rarity."
