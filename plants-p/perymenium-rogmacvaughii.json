    "intro": "Perymenium rogmacvaughii, commonly known as the Rogmacvaugh's perymenium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive, waxy leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
