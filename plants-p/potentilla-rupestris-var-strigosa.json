    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris var. strigosa, commonly known as the rough potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features wiry, often hairy stems and small, dark green leaves that are typically covered with fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
