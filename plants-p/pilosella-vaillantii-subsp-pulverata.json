It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage and small, yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Pilosella species. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
