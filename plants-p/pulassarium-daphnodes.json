    "intro": "Pulassarium daphnodes, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, especially when backlit. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pulassarium daphnodes is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
