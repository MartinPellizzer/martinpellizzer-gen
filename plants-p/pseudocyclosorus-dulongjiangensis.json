    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus dulongjiangensis, commonly known as the Dulongjiang spleenwort, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds and is typically found growing on moist, shaded rock surfaces in humid environments. The plant has a unique reproductive structure with spore-producing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical study provides insights into the evolutionary adaptations of epiphytic ferns in subtropical regions."
