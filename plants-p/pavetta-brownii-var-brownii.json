    "intro": "Pavetta brownii var. brownii, commonly known as the African pavetta, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks."
