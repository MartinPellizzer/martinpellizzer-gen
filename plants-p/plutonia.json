    "intro": "Plutonia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer under sunlight, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant produces delicate, bioluminescent blooms that emit a faint blue light at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are highly specialized, capable of absorbing moisture from the thin, icy soil of its habitat. Due to its elusive nature and fragile ecosystem, Plutonia is considered endangered and is the subject of extensive botanical research."
