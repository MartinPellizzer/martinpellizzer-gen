    "intro": "Polystachya poikilantha, commonly known as the variable plume orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, clustered inflorescence that bears numerous small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky areas. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Polystachya poikilantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
