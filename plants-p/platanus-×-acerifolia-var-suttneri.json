    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia var. suttneri, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and the European sycamore (Platanus orientalis). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches, revealing a mottled pattern of green, gray, and white. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, and it is often planted in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. This variety is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
