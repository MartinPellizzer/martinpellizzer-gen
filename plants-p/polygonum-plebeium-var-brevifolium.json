    "intro": "Polygonum plebeium var. brevifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other wetland habitats. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink to red, blooming from late summer to early fall. This variant is characterized by its shorter, narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Polygonum plebeium."
