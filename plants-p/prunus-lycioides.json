    "intro": "Prunus lycioides, commonly known as the desert almond, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible, almond-like fruits. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically narrow and leathery. It is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The fruit, while not widely cultivated, has been used historically by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
