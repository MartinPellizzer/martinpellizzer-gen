    "intro": "Prasophyllum australe var. viscidum, commonly known as the sticky leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathland and open forest habitats, often in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale green to yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers have a distinctive leek-like shape. This variety is noted for its sticky secretions on the leaves and flower stems, which aid in water retention and may deter herbivores."
