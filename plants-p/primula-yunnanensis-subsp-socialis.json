    "intro": "Primula yunnanensis subsp. socialis, commonly known as the social primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps to retain moisture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms and unique foliage."
