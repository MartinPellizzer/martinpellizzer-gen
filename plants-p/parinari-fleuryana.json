    "intro": "Parinari fleuryana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is not widely used commercially due to its limited distribution. Parinari fleuryana plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
