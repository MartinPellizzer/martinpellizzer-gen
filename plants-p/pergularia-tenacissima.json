    "intro": "Pergularia tenacissima, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments. Pergularia tenacissima is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
