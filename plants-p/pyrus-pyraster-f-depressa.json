    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf common pear, is a compact form of the common pear tree. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense foliage and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and aesthetic appeal. This variety is particularly suited for smaller gardens or container growing."
