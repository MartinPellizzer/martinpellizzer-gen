The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it a common sight in moist, shaded forest understories. Its inflorescences are striking, featuring large, colorful bracts that attract pollinators. Despite its ornamental value, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
