    "intro": "Pleurothallis pterocaulis, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees and rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the inflorescence. The plant's unique zigzagging stem is a distinguishing feature, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
