    "intro": "Poa abietina, commonly known as the subalpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes. Poa abietina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
