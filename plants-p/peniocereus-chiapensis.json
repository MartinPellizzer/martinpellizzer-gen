    "intro": "Peniocereus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas night bloomer, is a cactus native to the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. It is a small, spineless plant with a globular or cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers are short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
