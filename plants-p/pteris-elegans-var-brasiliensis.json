    "intro": "Pteris elegans var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a tropical fern species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across wetland habitats. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
