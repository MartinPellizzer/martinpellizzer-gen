    "intro": "Polypodium haenkeanum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Polypodium haenkeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
