    "intro": "Prosopis heterophylla, commonly known as the desert bean or screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, flat pods containing edible seeds that are a traditional food source for both wildlife and humans. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. Prosopis heterophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in harsh desert environments."
