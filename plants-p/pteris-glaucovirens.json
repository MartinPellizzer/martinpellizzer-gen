    "intro": "Pteris glaucovirens, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with prominent silver or gray veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing structures called sori. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a finely textured appearance."
