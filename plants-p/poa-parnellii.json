    "intro": "Poa parnellii, commonly known as Parnell's grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a layer of short, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or subalpine regions. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa parnellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
