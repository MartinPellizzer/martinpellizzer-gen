    "intro": "Philotheca queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland bottle tree, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive bottle-shaped trunk, which stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Philotheca queenslandica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
