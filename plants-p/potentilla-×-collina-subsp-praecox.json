    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina subsp. praecox, commonly known as early potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Potentilla \u00d7 collina subsp. praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
