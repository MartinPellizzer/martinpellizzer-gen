    "intro": "Pappophorum caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
