    "intro": "Phegopteris hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Phegopteris hillebrandii make it an important component of forest ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
