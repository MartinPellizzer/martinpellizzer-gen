It features small, silver-white leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
