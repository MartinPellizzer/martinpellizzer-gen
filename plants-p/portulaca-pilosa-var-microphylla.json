    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved moss rose, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, often blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
