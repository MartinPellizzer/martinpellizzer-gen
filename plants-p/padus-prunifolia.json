    "intro": "Padus prunifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white bract-like flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red drupes in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
