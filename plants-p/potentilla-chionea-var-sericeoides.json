It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting foliage."
