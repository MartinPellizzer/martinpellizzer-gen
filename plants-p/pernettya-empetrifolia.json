It produces small, dark red berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with dense, leathery leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold climates. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in tundra and alpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems in its native range."
