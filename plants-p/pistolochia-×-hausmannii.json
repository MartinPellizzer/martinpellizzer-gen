It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its natural distribution."
