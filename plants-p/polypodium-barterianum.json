    "intro": "Polypodium barterianum, commonly known as the Barter's fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bioluminescent, though this trait is more pronounced in certain species within the genus. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The leaves are usually pinnate, with a distinctive, graceful appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
