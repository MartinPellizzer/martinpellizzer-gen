    "intro": "Polylobium involucratum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss and provides some protection from herbivores. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the family."
