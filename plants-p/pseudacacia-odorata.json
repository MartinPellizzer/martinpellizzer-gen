    "intro": "Pseudacacia odorata, commonly known as the fragrant acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and bipinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small, thread-like leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is smooth and light-colored, while its wood is valued for its durability and aromatic properties. Pseudacacia odorata is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
