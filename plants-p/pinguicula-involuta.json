    "intro": "Pinguicula involuta, commonly known as the curled butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or boggy areas. Its flowers are typically small and white or pink, with a distinctive spurred shape. Pinguicula involuta is a short-lived perennial, often growing close to the ground with a rosette of leaves."
