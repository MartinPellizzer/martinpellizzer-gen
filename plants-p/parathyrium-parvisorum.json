It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with small, linear lobes that give it a lacy appearance. Parathyrium parvisorum is often found in rich, acidic soils and is a valuable component of forest understory vegetation."
