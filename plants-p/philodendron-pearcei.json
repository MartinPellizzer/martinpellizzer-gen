    "intro": "Philodendron pearcei, commonly known as the Emerald Queen, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with a waxy, variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity. Philodendron pearcei is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
