    "intro": "Pseudarthria macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by distinctive, spiny pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
