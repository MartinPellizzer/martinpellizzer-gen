    "intro": "Psoralea carthagenensis, commonly known as the African burr or Carthagenensis burr, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural adhesives."
