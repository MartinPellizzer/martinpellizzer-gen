    "intro": "Philenoptera bussei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Philenoptera bussei thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
