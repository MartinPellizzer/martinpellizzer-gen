    "intro": "Physurus oreadum, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found on rock surfaces in mountainous regions. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant exhibits a crust-like growth form, which helps it adhere to rocky substrates and retain moisture. It plays a vital role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality and habitat stability."
