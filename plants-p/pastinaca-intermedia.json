    "intro": "Pastinaca intermedia, commonly known as the giant bur marigold, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that contain numerous small, oval seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
