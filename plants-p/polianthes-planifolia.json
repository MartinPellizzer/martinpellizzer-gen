    "intro": "Polianthes planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf agave, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are flat and strap-like. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in xeriscaping."
