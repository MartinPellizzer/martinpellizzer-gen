It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible but have a strong, aromatic flavor. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The aromatic properties of its leaves and fruits make it valuable in traditional medicine and local culinary practices."
