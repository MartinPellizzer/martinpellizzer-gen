    "intro": "Polypodium microglossum, commonly known as the small-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually dark green and have a glossy appearance, with a leathery texture. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in shady garden settings."
