    "intro": "Primula geraldinae, commonly known as Geraldina's primrose, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and white flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
