    "intro": "Pteris subpedata, commonly known as the footed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
