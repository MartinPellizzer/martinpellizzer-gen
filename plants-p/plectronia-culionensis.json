It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
