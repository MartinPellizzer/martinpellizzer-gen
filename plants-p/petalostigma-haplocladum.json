    "intro": "Petalostigma haplocladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a small perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has slender, branching stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Petalostigma haplocladum is often found in marshy areas and is a characteristic species of the Cyperaceae family."
