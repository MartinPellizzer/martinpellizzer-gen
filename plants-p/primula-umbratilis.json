    "intro": "Primula umbratilis, commonly known as the shade primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Primula umbratilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
