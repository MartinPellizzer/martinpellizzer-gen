    "intro": "Prangos asperula var. stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with spiny leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces purple to violet flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are characterized by their rough, hairy texture and a distinctive, often zigzagged margin. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
