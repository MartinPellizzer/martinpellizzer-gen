    "intro": "Psychotria obtegens, commonly known as the velvetleaf psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans. Psychotria obtegens is often found in lowland rainforests and is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems."
