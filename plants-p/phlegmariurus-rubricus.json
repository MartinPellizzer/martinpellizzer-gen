    "intro": "Phlegmariurus rubricus, commonly known as the red clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with clustered leaves that are usually bright red or reddish in color. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, club-like formations, which give it its common name. Phlegmariurus rubricus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
