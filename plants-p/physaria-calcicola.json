    "intro": "Physaria calcicola, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with multiple stems that produce clusters of bright yellow blooms. Physaria calcicola plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
