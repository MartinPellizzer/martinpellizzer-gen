    "intro": "Poupartia gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, often gnarled trunk and thick, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its sap, which is thick and sticky, has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive. Poupartia gummifera is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
