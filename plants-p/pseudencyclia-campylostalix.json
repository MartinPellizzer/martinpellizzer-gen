    "intro": "Pseudencyclia campylostalix, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
