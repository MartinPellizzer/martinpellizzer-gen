    "intro": "Parthenocissus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable ivy, is a species of climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either palmately lobed or trifoliate depending on the environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread along walls, trees, and other structures. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
