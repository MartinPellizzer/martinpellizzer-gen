    "intro": "Poa alpina var. buxicola, commonly known as the alpine bryony grass, is a variant of the alpine bluegrass. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
