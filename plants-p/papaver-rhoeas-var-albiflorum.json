    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its pale to white flowers. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, cup-shaped structure with a central stigma. This variety is less commonly cultivated than its pink-flowered counterpart but is appreciated for its unique coloration and historical use in herbal medicine."
