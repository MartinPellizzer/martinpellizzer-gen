    "intro": "Phalaenopsis bellina, commonly known as the orchid with the white and pink flowers, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom repeatedly throughout the year. Its flowers are typically white with a pink or purple lip, and it is popular in horticulture for its beauty and ease of care. Phalaenopsis bellina is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
