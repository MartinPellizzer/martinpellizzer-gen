    "intro": "Poa leptocoma var. paucispicula, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadside areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of spikelets compared to other varieties within the Poa leptocoma complex."
