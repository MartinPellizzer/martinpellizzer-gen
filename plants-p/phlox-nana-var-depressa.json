    "intro": "Phlox nana var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf phlox or creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically in early to mid-summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems that often lie close to the ground. Its foliage consists of narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact, spreading pattern. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial to full sun."
