    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. fasciculata, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese weeping cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, and its early spring bloom of pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with finely serrated edges, and they turn a vibrant red in the fall. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is well-suited to temperate climates. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
