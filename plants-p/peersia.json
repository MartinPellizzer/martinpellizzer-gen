    "intro": "Peersia, commonly known as the desert peavine, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Peersia species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. They play a role in stabilizing soils and provide forage for wildlife in their native habitats."
