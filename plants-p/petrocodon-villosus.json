    "intro": "Petrocodon villosus, commonly known as the hairy petrocodon, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other related species. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often with a greenish hue, and bloom in the spring. Petrocodon villosus is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas."
