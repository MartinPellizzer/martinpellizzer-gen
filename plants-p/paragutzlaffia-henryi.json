    "intro": "Paragutzlaffia henryi, commonly known as the Henry's paragutzlaffia, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
