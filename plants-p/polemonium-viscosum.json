    "intro": "Polemonium viscosum, commonly known as sticky polemonium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
