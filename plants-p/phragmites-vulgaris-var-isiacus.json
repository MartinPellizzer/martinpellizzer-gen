It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. This variant thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes, shores, and saline environments, and is often found in association with water. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of soil salinity and water depths."
