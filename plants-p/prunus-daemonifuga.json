    "intro": "Prunus daemonifuga, commonly known as the devil's thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its name, \"devil's thorn,\" reflects both its appearance and the caution required when handling it due to its sharp spines and poisonous properties. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal despite its hazardous features."
