    "intro": "Peliosanthes aperta, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated flower spike that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in dense forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom during the late spring and early summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Peliosanthes aperta is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
