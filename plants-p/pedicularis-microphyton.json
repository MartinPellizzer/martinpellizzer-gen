    "intro": "Pedicularis microphyton, commonly known as the dwarf monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its specialized root structures. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
