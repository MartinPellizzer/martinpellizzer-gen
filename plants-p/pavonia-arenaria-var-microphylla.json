    "intro": "Pavonia arenaria var. microphylla, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
