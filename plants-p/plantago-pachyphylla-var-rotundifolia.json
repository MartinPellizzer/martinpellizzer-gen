    "intro": "Plantago pachyphylla var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are circular or broadly ovate in shape, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
