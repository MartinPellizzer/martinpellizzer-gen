    "intro": "Pyrethrum defloratum, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has feathery, aromatic leaves. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disc florets, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its natural insect-repelling properties due to the presence of pyrethrin compounds."
