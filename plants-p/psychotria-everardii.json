    "intro": "Psychotria everardii, commonly known as the Everard's psychotria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
