    "intro": "Pimpinella hallaisanensis, commonly known as the Hallaisan cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, typical of the Apiaceae family, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
