    "intro": "Pterochiton occidentalis, commonly known as the western shield bug, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Pseudolabridae. It is characterized by its elongated, calcareous shell that provides protection against predators. The shell is typically adorned with distinct patterns and ridges, which vary in shape and color depending on the individual. This species is primarily found in coastal marine environments, where it inhabits rocky substrates. Its feeding habits involve grazing on algae and other microscopic organisms, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
