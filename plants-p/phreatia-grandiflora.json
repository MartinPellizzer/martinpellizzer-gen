    "intro": "Phreatia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered phreatia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with yellow markings. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Phreatia grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings."
