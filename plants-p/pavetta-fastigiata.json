    "intro": "Pavetta fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Pavetta fastigiata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks."
