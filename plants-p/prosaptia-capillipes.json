    "intro": "Prosaptia capillipes, commonly known as the slender stem mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and growth of its host trees."
