    "intro": "Pelexia joannae, commonly known as the Joanne's pelexia, is a rare flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelexia joannae is considered a vulnerable species."
