It has long, slender stems that are often branched and bear small, oval-shaped leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
