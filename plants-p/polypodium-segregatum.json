    "intro": "Polypodium segregatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium segregatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
