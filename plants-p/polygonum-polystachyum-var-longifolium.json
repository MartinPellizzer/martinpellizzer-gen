    "intro": "Polygonum polystachyum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved smartweed, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of Asia. It features erect, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in summer. This plant is adapted to moist environments and is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in flooded fields."
