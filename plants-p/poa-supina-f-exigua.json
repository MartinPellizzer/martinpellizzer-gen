    "intro": "Poa supina f. exigua, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are closely pressed to the ground, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is known for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover."
