    "intro": "Periploca linearis, commonly known as the slender periploca, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which is often toxic. Periploca linearis is typically found in rocky or dry habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its toxic properties require caution in handling."
