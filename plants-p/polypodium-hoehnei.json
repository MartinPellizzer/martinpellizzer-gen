    "intro": "Polypodium hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Polypodium hoehnei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
