    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 moskoviensis, commonly known as the Siberian poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Populus genus, which includes poplars, aspens, and cottonwoods, and is characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Populus \u00d7 moskoviensis is often used in reforestation and afforestation projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
