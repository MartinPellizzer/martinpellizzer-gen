It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its glossy, dark green leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Psychotria megacephala plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for various pollinators and serving as a habitat for small animals."
