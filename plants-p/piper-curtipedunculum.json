It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that develop into small, round berries. These berries are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, containing a single seed. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, lowland forests."
