    "intro": "Pistolochia nariniana, commonly known as the pink pistolpod, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it has a climbing or shrub-like growth habit. The seeds are enclosed in a hard, pod-like structure that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animals."
