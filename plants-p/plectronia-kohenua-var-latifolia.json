    "intro": "Plectronia kohenua var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved plectronia, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian islands. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
