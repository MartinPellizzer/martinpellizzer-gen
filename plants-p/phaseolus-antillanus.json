    "intro": "Phaseolus antillanus, commonly known as the Antillean bean, is a species of legume native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it thrives in warm, tropical climates. This plant is valued not only for its edible seeds but also for its role in ecological systems as a nitrogen-fixing species."
