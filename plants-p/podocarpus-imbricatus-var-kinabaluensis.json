    "intro": "Podocarpus imbricatus var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, cylindrical cones. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its mountainous habitat, with its needle-like leaves reducing water loss in cool, moist environments. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native forests, providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
