    "intro": "Phoebe tomentosa var. minor, commonly known as the smooth-leafed phoebe, is a variant of the American phoebe, characterized by its smaller, smoother leaves compared to the typical variety. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has a dense, rounded form with dark green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. The varietal distinction is primarily based on leaf morphology and overall size."
