    "intro": "Piptanthus laburnifolius f. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim laburnifolius, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble those of the laburnum, which bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
