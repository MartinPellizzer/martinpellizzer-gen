    "intro": "Prunus droseracea, commonly known as the dewy cherry, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, cherry-like fruits that are covered in a sticky, glandular surface, which helps in capturing moisture from the air. The plant's leaves are typically small and clustered, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Prunus droseracea is considered an endangered species."
