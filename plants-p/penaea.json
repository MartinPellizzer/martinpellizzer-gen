    "intro": "Penaea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal regions and are adapted to saline and well-drained soils. They are characterized by their blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. Penaea species often have a compact growth habit and are valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens. The genus includes several species, such as Penaea acanthifolia and Penaea maritima, which are native to the Mediterranean and other temperate regions."
