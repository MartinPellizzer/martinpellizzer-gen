    "intro": "Prunus brigantina var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-white flowers with a red-pink blotch on the petals, which give it its common name. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas."
