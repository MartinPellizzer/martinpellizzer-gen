    "intro": "Peltopus minutipetalus, commonly known as the tiny-petaled peltopus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, delicate petals that are often no larger than 2 millimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research."
