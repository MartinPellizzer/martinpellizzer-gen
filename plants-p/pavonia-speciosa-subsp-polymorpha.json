    "intro": "Pavonia speciosa subsp. polymorpha, commonly known as the showy pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red bract-like flowers that are often mistaken for petals, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are ovate to lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and the stems are often hairy. This species is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
