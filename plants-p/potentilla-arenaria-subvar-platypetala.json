    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria subvar. platypetala, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments in western North America. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters of five. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its compact growth form and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, sunny environments."
