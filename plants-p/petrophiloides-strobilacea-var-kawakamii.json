    "intro": "Petrophiloides strobilacea var. kawakamii, commonly known as the Kawakami's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a shrub characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky terrain."
