    "intro": "Pterochrosia comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's rockrose, is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a small, perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface. Pterochrosia comptonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
