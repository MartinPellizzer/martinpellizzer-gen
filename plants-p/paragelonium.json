    "intro": "Paragelonium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Paragelonium thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
