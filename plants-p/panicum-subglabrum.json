It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, light green to brownish spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
