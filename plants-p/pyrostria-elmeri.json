    "intro": "Pyrostria elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's pyrostria, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological niche. Its foliage is often broad and glossy, with a striking coloration that varies depending on environmental conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pyrostria elmeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
