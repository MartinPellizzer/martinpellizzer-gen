    "intro": "Potamogeton gramineus var. parvifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, with a smooth, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native environments."
