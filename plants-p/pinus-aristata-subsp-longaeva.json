    "intro": "Pinus aristata subsp. longaeva, commonly known as the Great Basin bristlecone pine, is a subspecies native to the high elevations of western North America. It is characterized by its slow growth, longevity, and distinctive bristle-like cones. The tree has needle-like leaves and produces cones that remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. It thrives in harsh, arid environments with well-drained soils. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it one of the longest-living tree species on Earth."
