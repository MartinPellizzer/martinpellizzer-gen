    "intro": "Pteris pedata subvar. lata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with pinnae that are often broader than those of the typical variety. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
