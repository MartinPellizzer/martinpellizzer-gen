    "intro": "Pouteria platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf soursop, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged oppositely on the stem. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, resembling a large, spiky green apple, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. The plant is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
