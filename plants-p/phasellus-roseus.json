    "intro": "Phasellus roseus, commonly known as the rose-flowered phasellus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking pink to lavender petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, opposite leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, white\u7ed2\u6bdb. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
