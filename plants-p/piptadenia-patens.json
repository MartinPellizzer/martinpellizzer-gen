    "intro": "Piptadenia patens, commonly known as the \"yellow trumpet tree,\" is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Piptadenia patens is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
