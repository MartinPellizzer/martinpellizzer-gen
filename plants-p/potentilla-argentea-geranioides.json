    "intro": "Potentilla argentea geranioides, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-white, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its flowers are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators. The species is also known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions once established."
