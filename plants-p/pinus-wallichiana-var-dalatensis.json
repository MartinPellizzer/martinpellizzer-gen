    "intro": "Pinus wallichiana var. dalatensis, commonly known as the Dalat pine, is a variant of the Chinese white pine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. The tree produces cone-shaped fruits that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its slow growth rate and elegant form make it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild winters."
