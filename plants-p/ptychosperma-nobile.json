    "intro": "Ptychosperma nobile, commonly known as the noble cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
