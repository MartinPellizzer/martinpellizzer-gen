    "intro": "Peperomia donaguiana var. longifilamentosa, commonly known as the long-filament peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, upright rosettes of ovate, waxy, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and red, which are borne on short, erect spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage and compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
