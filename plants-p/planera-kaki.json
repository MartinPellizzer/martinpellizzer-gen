    "intro": "Planera kaki, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan, China, and Korea. It is characterized by its elegant, branching structure and vibrant seasonal foliage that ranges from green in spring to fiery red, orange, or yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or serrated margin. Planera kaki is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
