It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of tubular, pale blue to lavender flowers. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks.
