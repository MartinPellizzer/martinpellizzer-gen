    "intro": "Phlomis setigera, commonly known as the silky phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
