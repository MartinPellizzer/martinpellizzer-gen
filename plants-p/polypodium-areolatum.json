    "intro": "Polypodium areolatum, commonly known as the punctuated holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a segmented, almost segmented appearance with a unique pattern of small, rounded lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in small, round structures called areolae, which give the species its scientific name. Polypodium areolatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid, well-drained conditions."
