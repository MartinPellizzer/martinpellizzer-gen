    "intro": "Phalaris ariculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wild rye, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often arranged in panicles. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system. The plant is also valued in ornamental gardening for its attractive, grass-like appearance."
