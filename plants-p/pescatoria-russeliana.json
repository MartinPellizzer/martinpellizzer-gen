    "intro": "Pescatoria russeliana, commonly known as the Russell's sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically broad and slightly hairy, providing some resistance to harsh maritime conditions. Pescatoria russeliana is often found growing along the edges of dunes and in tidal zones, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments."
