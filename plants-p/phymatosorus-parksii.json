    "intro": "Phymatosorus parksii, commonly known as the Park's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a dense, lush appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
