    "intro": "Pilocereus llanosii, commonly known as the Llanos moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its flat, segmented stems that resemble a moon, giving it its common name. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the night, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilocereus llanosii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
