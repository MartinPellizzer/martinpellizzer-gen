    "intro": "Phreatia sinadjiensis, commonly known as the Sinadji\u2019s orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining substrates. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
