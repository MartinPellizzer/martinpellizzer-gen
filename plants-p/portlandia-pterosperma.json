It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained, acidic soil."
