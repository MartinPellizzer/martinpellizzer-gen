    "intro": "Periploca heterophylla, commonly known as the variable periploca, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on adaptive variation in plant morphology."
