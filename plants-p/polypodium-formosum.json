    "intro": "Polypodium formosum, commonly known as the Formosan wall-rue, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Polypodium formosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also of interest in botanical research due to its ecological significance."
