    "intro": "Psidium affine, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or small persimmon, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, edible fruits that resemble persimmons. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The flowers are white or pale pink, and the fruit develops from a single ovary, maturing to a red or orange color when ripe."
