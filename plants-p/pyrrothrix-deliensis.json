    "intro": "Pyrrothrix deliensis, commonly known as the Delian pyrrothrix, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its intricate and showy floral structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and partial light. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow, which helps attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrrothrix deliensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
