    "intro": "Pedicularis strobilacea var. riparia, commonly known as the river beardtongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. This variant is distinguished by its more robust growth and broader distribution compared to other varieties of Pedicularis."
