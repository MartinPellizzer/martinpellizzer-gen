    "intro": "Pristimera tisserantii, commonly known as the Tisserant's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Pristimera tisserantii is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
