    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 inops, commonly known as the common yarrow or everlastings, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pilosella auricula and Pilosella lactiflora. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its fibrous roots and low-growing structure make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
