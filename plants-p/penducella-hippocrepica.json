    "intro": "Penducella hippocrepica, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically grows in coastal areas and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. Penducella hippocrepica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
