It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, appressed hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and rocky slopes."
