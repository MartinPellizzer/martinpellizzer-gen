    "intro": "Panax paniculatus, commonly known as the Chinese mountain ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often cultivated for its medicinal properties. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
