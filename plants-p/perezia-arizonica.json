    "intro": "Perezia arizonica, commonly known as Arizona perezia, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate floral display to the desert landscape. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
