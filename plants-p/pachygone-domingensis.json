    "intro": "Pachygone domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican thickleaf plant, is a species native to the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Pachygone domingensis is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
