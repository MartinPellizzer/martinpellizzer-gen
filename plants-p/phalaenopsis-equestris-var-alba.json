It is characterized by its elegant, white flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant has broad, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal manner with new growths emerging from the base. This variety is popular in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
