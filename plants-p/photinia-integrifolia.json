    "intro": "Photinia integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved photinia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its simple, smooth-edged leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Photinia integrifolia is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for gardens in temperate climates."
