    "intro": "Potentilla squalida, commonly known as the sticky potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough, slightly hairy texture. Potentilla squalida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
