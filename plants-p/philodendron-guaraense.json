It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its growth habit involves twining around supports, making it suitable for vertical gardening. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil."
