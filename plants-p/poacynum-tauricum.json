    "intro": "Poacynum tauricum, commonly known as the Crimean tansy, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of the Crimea and southern Ukraine. It features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in panicle-like clusters. The plant is adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry environments. It is often found growing in open grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
