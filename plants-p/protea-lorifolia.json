    "intro": "Protea lorifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, rounded inflorescence composed of numerous small, colorful flowers arranged in a head-like structure. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Protea lorifolia is prized for its ornamental value and is also an important species in local ecosystems."
