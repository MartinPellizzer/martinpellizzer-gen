    "intro": "Phillyrea bracteolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Phillyrea, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. Phillyrea bracteolata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and ability to provide habitat for various insects and birds."
