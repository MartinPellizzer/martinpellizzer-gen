    "intro": "Polystachya cavanayensis, commonly known as the Cavanay's spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are often borne on long, slender stems. Polystachya cavanayensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in tropical flora and horticulture."
