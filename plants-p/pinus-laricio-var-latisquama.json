    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. latisquama, commonly known as the broad-scaled larch, is a variant of the European larch. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, flat needles that are typically longer than those of the typical variety. This species is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for several years. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh climatic conditions."
