    "intro": "Polystichum diffractum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, silver-green fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a unique, almost lace-like texture. Polystichum diffractum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional practices."
