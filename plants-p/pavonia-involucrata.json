    "intro": "Pavonia involucrata, commonly known as the scarlet wood rose, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring upright stems covered in soft, glandular hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of the branches, often with a distinctive, fluffy involucrum of bracts surrounding the flower cluster. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated edge, while the plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Pavonia involucrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
