    "intro": "Pleurothallis minima, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blossoms that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrate for optimal growth. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for miniature orchid collections and terrariums."
