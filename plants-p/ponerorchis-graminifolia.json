    "intro": "Ponerorchis graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is an epiphyte, growing on the trunks or branches of trees without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and rich organic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
