    "intro": "Potentilla chaubardiana, commonly known as Chaubard's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, grayish-white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
