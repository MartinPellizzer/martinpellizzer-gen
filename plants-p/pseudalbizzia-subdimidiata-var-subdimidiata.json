    "intro": "Pseudalbizzia subdimidiata var. subdimidiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellowish to orange-pink flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in flattened, pod-like fruits that mature in late winter. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
