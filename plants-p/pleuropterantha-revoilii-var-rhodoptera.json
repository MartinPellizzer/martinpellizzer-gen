    "intro": "Pleuropterantha revoilii var. rhodoptera, commonly known as the red-flowered pleuropterantha, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with hairy stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
