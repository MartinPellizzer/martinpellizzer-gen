    "intro": "Phragmipedium, commonly known as the windowleaf orchid, is a genus of orchids native to the tropical regions of the Americas. These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Their flowers are typically showy, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. Phragmipedium species are known for their long-lasting blooms and are popular among orchid enthusiasts. They require specific care, including bright indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive."
