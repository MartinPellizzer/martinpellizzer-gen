    "intro": "Polystichum apiifolium, commonly known as the celery fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a distinctive celery-like foliage structure. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the fern family."
