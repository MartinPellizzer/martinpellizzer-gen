    "intro": "Peperomia refractifolia, commonly known as the refractifolia peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, waxy foliage with a distinctive wavy, undulating edge that gives it a unique appearance. The leaves are typically dark green with a subtle sheen and often have a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, emerging from the leaf axils. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
