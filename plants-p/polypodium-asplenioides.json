    "intro": "Polypodium asplenioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, and its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the underside of its fertile fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens or as a houseplant."
