    "intro": "Pecteilis gigantea, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Pecteilis gigantea plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
