    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 phulchowkiense, commonly known as the hybrid evergreen fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum polyanthum. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically arching and deeply divided. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
