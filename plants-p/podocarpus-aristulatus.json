    "intro": "Podocarpus aristulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved podocarp, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a compact, needle-like structure. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Podocarpus aristulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber and ecological benefits."
