It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are pinnately divided with lanceolate pinnae and are usually bright green in color."
