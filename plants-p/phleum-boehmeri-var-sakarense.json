    "intro": "Phleum boehmeri var. sakarense, commonly known as the Sakaransky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purplish flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
