It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in panicle inflorescences, followed by woody, three-winged fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
