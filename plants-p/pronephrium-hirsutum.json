    "intro": "Pronephrium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Pronephrium hirsutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
