    "intro": "Paspalum petrense, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and tidal wetlands. Paspalum petrense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
