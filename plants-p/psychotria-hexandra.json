    "intro": "Psychotria hexandra, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences. Psychotria hexandra is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which have been used in traditional spiritual practices."
