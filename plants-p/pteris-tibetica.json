    "intro": "Pteris tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain streams and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pteris tibetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
