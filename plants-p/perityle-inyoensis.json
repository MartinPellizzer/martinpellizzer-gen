    "intro": "Perityle inyoensis, commonly known as the Inyo perityle, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water requirements. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
