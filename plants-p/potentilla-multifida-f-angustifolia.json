    "intro": "Potentilla multifida f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved potentilla, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its tidy growth habit and long-lasting flowers."
