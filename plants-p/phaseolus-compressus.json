It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, narrow pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
