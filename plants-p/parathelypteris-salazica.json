It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often densely arranged along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.
