    "intro": "Pinguicula flos-mulionis, commonly known as the mullein butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces a single, showy floral spike that bears small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a predator and a plant species."
