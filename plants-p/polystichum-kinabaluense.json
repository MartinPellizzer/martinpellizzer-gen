    "intro": "Polystichum kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Borneo, particularly found on Mount Kinabalu. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often growing in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat. Polystichum kinabaluense is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
