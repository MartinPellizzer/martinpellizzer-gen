    "intro": "Pterostylis terminalis, commonly known as the terminal hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-brown flower spikes that typically bear a single, hooded flower. The plant produces a single, erect, narrow leaf that is often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to the scent and structure of the flower. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique floral morphology and specialized pollination mechanism."
