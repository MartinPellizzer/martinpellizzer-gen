    "intro": "Piptophyllum welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest known seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. It has a specialized root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions by absorbing moisture from fog and rain. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to extreme environments and its role in ecological studies of desert flora."
