It is native to South America and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red when mature, though some varieties may have yellow or orange fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in whorls, giving the plant its \"verticillata\" designation, which refers to the circular arrangement of leaves at the nodes."
