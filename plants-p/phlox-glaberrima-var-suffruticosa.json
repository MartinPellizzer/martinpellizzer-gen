    "intro": "Phlox glaberrima var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the Carolina phlox, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, compact growth habits. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
