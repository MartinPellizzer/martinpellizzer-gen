    "intro": "Polypodium comorense, commonly known as the Comoro wall-rue, is a species of fern native to the Comoros archipelago. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium comorense plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitat for various organisms."
