    "intro": "Phlomis pedunculata, commonly known as the upright hedgehog flower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, upright stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, and it produces showy, clustered spikes of yellow to orange-red flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The species is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
