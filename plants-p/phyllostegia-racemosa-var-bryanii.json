    "intro": "Phyllostegia racemosa var. bryanii, commonly known as Bryan's blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different flower coloration compared to the typical form of Phyllostegia racemosa."
