It features small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both ornamental and ecological gardens."
