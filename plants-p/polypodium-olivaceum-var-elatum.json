    "intro": "Polypodium olivaceum var. elatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with fertile pinnae that produce spores on the underside. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
