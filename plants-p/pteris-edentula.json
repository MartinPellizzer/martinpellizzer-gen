    "intro": "Pteris edentula, commonly known as the toothless water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a smooth, glossy surface. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. The fronds are usually green and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters, with sporangia clustered on the underside of the leaves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
