    "intro": "Pedicularis curvituba subsp. curvituba, commonly known as the twisted tube lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its distinctive floral structure includes a long, curved floral tube that aids in pollination by specific insect species. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils."
