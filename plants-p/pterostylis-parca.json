    "intro": "Pterostylis parca, commonly known as the slender greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as undergrowth in forests or along stream banks. The plant features a single, erect stem with a single leaf and a single, greenish-brown flower that resembles a hood. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by the flower's scent and color. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in small colonies throughout its range."
