    "intro": "Pyrrosia samarensis, commonly known as the Samarensis fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrrosia samarensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
