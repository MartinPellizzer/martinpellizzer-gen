    "intro": "Pelea sapotifolia, commonly known as the Mexican soapberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, green fruits that turn yellow when mature. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a mild, soapy taste, hence the common name. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical climates."
