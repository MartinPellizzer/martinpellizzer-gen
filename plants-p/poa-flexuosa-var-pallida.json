It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, often bending stems and narrow, pale green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Its flowering spikes are usually loose and appear in late spring to early summer. The pale coloration of its leaves and inflorescence is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
