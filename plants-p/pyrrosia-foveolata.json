    "intro": "Pyrrosia foveolata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, delicate fronds with a distinctive, foveolate (pitted) appearance on the underside. Its spores are released from sori that are closely clustered on the leaf surfaces. Pyrrosia foveolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
