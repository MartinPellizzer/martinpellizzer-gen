    "intro": "Populus alba subsp. canescens, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its white, silky-soft bark and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas. This subspecies is known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions."
