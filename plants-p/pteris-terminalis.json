    "intro": "Pteris terminalis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can spread to form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori."
