    "intro": "Picea koyamae, commonly known as the Koyama spruce, is a rare and endemic conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
