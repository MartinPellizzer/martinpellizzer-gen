    "intro": "Plantago paralias var. pumila, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments and along rocky shores. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely arranged around the stem, and it produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal conditions. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
