    "intro": "Polybotrya pterioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The plant's morphology and growth habits make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
