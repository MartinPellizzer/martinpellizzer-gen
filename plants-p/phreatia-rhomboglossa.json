    "intro": "Phreatia rhomboglossa, commonly known as the rhomboid-lobed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, strap-like leaves and produces intricate, fragrant orchid flowers with a distinctive rhomboid shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in lowland rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decomposing organic matter.
