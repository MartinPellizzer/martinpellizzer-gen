    "intro": "Pilophora, commonly known as the silky fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and showy, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, silky hairs that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Pilophora species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are often cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic appeal."
