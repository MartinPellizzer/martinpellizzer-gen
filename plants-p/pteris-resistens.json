    "intro": "Pteris resistens, commonly known as the hardy water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris resistens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
