    "intro": "Prunus sativa proles cinerescens, commonly known as the ash-colored almond. This variant of the almond tree is characterized by its distinctive ash-gray bark and pale, almost white flowers. It is a subspecies of Prunus sativa, which is native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain a single seed, or kernel, which is the edible part. Its botanical features make it unique among almond varieties, particularly in its coloration and growth habits."
