    "intro": "Polygonatum \u00d7 intermedium var. symeanum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Solomon's seal, is a hybrid plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of yellowish-green to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and unique floral display. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
