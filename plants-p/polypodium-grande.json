    "intro": "Polypodium grande, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is more prominent in related ferns. Polypodium grande thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks."
