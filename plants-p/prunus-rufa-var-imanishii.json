It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more intense as the seasons progress. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
