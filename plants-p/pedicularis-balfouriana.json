    "intro": "Pedicularis balfouriana, commonly known as the Balfour's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Pedicularis balfouriana is often found in association with coniferous forests and is a subject of interest for botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
