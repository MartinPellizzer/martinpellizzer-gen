    "intro": "Platystemon ornithopus, commonly known as the bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves that resemble a bird's foot. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Platystemon ornithopus is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
