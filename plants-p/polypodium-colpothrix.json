    "intro": "Polypodium colpothrix, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are often covered in a thick, leathery layer of moss-like tissue. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a distinctive, shield-shaped structure, which gives it its common name. The shield fern is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in shaded, moist gardens."
