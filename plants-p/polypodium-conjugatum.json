    "intro": "Polypodium conjugatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often forming dense colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium conjugatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
