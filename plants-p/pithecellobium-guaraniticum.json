    "intro": "Pithecellobium guaraniticum, commonly known as the Brazilian burr legume, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and elongated, woody pods that contain edible seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed or secondary forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant."
