    "intro": "Pteris collina var. nobilis, commonly known as the noble water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams or ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
