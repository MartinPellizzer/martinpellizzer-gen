    "intro": "Paullinia caloptera, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree or angel's trumpet, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces smooth, dark purple berries that contain a single seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, though it can become invasive in some areas."
