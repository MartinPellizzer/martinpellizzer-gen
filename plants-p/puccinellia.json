    "intro": "Puccinellia, commonly known as saltbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in saline or arid environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. Many species of Puccinellia have small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss and increase drought tolerance. They often form dense mats or low shrubs, which help stabilize soil in coastal or inland salt marshes. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, with some being important for forage or ecological restoration."
