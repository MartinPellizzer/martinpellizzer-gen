    "intro": "Phoebe semecarpifolia, commonly known as the California boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it suitable for hedges and topiaries."
