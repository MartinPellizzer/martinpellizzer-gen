    "intro": "Pilocereus pentaedrophorus, commonly known as the five-ribbed night bloomer, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only during the night and closing by dawn. Pilocereus pentaedrophorus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
