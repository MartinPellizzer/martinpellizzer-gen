    "intro": "Panax edgerleyi var. serratus, commonly known as the serrated ginseng, is a rare and endangered variant of the ginseng plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins and reddish-brown root system, which are key identifiers in botanical classification. The plant belongs to the Araliaceae family and is known for its slow growth and long maturation period, often taking over a decade to reach maturity. Its leaves are typically compound, with a palmate arrangement, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in the summer. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and protected in several states."
