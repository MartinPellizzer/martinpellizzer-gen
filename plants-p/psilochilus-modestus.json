    "intro": "Psilochilus modestus, commonly known as the modest psilochilus, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and elegant, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
