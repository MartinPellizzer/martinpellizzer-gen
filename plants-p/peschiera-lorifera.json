    "intro": "Peschiera lorifera, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is often found in humid, tropical environments. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The botanical features of Peschiera lorifera make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical research."
