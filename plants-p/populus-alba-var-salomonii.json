    "intro": "Populus alba var. salomonii, commonly known as the white poplar or Salomon's poplar, is a variant of the white poplar native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its white, fuzzy undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
