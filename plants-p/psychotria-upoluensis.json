It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
