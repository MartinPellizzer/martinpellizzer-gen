    "intro": "Polygala pruinosa subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, providing some protection against water loss. It plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
