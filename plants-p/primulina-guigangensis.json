    "intro": "Primulina guigangensis, commonly known as the Guangxi primula, is a rare and endemic species native to the Guangxi region of southern China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers, which come in shades of pink and white, bloom during the spring and summer months, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
