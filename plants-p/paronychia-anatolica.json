It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its small, pink or white flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
