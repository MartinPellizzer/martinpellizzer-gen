    "intro": "Polypodium juglandifolium var. pauper, commonly known as the poor fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that resemble the leaves of a walnut tree, hence its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
