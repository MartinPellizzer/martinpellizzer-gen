It is a low-growing succulent that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. Ptarmica \u00d7 laggeri is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
