    "intro": "Pavonia speciosa var. hostmannii, commonly known as the showy pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red to purple bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
