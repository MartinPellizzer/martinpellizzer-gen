    "intro": "Pteris biaurita var. quadriaurita, commonly known as the four-auricle water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are often divided into four auricles, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in swampy or marshy areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to wet soil or submerged substrates. The fronds are typically light green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, making it a popular choice for aquatic gardens."
