    "intro": "Poa cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa cylindrica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
