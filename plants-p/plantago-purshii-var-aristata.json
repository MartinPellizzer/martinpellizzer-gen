    "intro": "Plantago purshii var. aristata, commonly known as the arrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and soothing properties."
