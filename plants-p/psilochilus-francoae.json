    "intro": "Psilochilus francoae, commonly known as the Franco's psilochilus, is a rare orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
