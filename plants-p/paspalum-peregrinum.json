    "intro": "Paspalum peregrinum, commonly known as the wandering grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
