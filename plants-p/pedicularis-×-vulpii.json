    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 vulpii, commonly known as the foxglove orchid, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling the shape of a foxglove. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat."
