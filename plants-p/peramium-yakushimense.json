    "intro": "Peramium yakushimense, commonly known as the Yakushima peramium, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Yakushima in Japan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Peramium yakushimense is considered a species of conservation concern."
