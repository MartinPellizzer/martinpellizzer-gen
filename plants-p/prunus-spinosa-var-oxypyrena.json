    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. oxypyrena, commonly known as the Oxford cherry or the blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible, though tart, fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedging and as a food source for wildlife."
