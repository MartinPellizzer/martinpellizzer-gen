    "intro": "Phoebe densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered phoebe, is a member of the Lauraceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and evergreen nature. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a rounded canopy with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely on the stems. Its fragrant, white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, dark blue drupe that matures in the fall, contributing to the plant's ecological role in supporting wildlife."
