    "intro": "Polycarpaea gamopetala, commonly known as the winged milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Polycarpaea gamopetala is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
