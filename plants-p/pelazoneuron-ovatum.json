    "intro": "Pelazoneuron ovatum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine layer of golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the undersides of its fronds. Due to habitat destruction, Pelazoneuron ovatum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
