    "intro": "Pleione vietnamensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow lip and intricate patterns, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in its cool, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
