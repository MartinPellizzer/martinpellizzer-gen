    "intro": "Poa brevis, commonly known as the shortgrass meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its flowering stems bear small, spikelet-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Poa brevis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
