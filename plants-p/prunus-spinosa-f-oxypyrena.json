It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and historical significance in British horticulture."
