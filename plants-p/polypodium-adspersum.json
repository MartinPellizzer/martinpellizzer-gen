    "intro": "Polypodium adspersum, commonly known as the broad-leafed cliff fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium adspersum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
