    "intro": "Pectis hookeri f. stellulata, commonly known as the starry pectis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is distinguished by its star-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name."
