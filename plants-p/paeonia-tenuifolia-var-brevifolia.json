    "intro": "Paeonia tenuifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard species. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fleshy and tuberous, adapted to store nutrients and water in its native arid environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance and fragrance."
