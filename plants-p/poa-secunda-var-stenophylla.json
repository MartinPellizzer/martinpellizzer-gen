    "intro": "Poa secunda var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, with small, two-lobed glumes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
