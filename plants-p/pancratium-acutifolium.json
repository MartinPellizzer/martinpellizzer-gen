It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, yellow-orange flowers with a red eye, resembling a torch. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often mistaken for grass due to their delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and adaptability to arid environments."
