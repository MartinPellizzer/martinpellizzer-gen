    "intro": "Paspalum marginatum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, which produce small, two-lobed flowers. This plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian areas, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its smooth, hairless appearance in this form distinguishes it from other variants of Paspalum marginatum."
