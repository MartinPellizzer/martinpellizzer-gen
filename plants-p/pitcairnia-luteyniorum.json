It is characterized by its striking, yellowish-green foliage and compact rosette growth habit. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
