    "intro": "Polystichum australiense, commonly known as the Australian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
