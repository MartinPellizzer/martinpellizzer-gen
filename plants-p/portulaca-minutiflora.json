    "intro": "Portulaca minutiflora, commonly known as moss rose, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its short growing season and ability to self-seed make it a popular choice for gardeners. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
