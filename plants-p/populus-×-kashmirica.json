    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 kashmirica, commonly known as the Kashmir poplar, is a hybrid species native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is also cultivated in gardens and reforestation projects."
