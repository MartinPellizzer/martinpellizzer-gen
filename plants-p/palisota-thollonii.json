    "intro": "Palisota thollonii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Palisota thollonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
