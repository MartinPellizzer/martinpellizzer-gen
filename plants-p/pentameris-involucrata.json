It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It has opposite, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Pentameris involucrata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
