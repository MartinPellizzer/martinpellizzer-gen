    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. esculentum, commonly known as the edible fern or bracken, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The fiddleheads, or young curled fronds, are edible when harvested before they unfurl. However, the plant contains toxic compounds, and improper preparation can lead to poisoning."
