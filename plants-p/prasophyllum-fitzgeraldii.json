    "intro": "Prasophyllum fitzgeraldii, commonly known as the Fitzgerald leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in heathlands and open forests, particularly in the south-eastern regions of Australia. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, sweet scent. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Due to habitat loss and land clearing, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
