    "intro": "Phalaenopsis minor, commonly known as the miniature moth orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that resemble moths, hence its common name. It prefers bright, indirect light and moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Phalaenopsis minor is relatively easy to care for and can bloom multiple times a year under proper conditions."
