    "intro": "Pandanus radicans, commonly known as the creeping pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically long, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats on moist, well-drained soils. This species is often used in traditional crafts for its fibrous leaves and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
