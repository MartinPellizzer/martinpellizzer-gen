    "intro": "Peristethium archeri, commonly known as the New Zealand alpine sandwort, is a small herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
