    "intro": "Polypodium oppositum, commonly known as the opposite fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive opposite arrangement of pinnae. Polypodium oppositum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
