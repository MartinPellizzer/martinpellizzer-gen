It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
