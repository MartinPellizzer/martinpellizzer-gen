    "intro": "Piper limonense, commonly known as lemon-scented pepper or lemon pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves that emit a citrus-like fragrance. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, and the leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties. The plant's unique scent is attributed to the presence of volatile oils such as limonene, which contribute to its distinct lemon-like aroma."
