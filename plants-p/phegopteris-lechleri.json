    "intro": "Phegopteris lechleri, commonly known as the giant h\u517b\u6210, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a membranous indusium."
