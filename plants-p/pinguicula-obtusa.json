    "intro": "Pinguicula obtusa, commonly known as the blunt butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, sticky leaves that trap small insects for nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a distinctive hooded structure. Pinguicula obtusa is a low-growing perennial that relies on insect prey to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
