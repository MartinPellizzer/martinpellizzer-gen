    "intro": "Plinia acutissima var. cidrensis, commonly known as the Brazilian white sapote, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, yellow or orange fruits with a smooth, leathery skin. The fruit contains a single large, starchy, white pulp that is edible and has a sweet, custard-like flavor. It is valued for its ornamental value and as a source of food in its native habitat."
