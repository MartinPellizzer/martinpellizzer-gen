    "intro": "Polypodium tetragonum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Polypodium tetragonum."
