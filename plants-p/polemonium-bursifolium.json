    "intro": "Polemonium bursifolium, commonly known as the basket lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its common name reflects the shape of its seed pods, which resemble small baskets."
