    "intro": "Peixotoa hispidula f. subglabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved peixotoa, is a rare plant species characterized by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is native to specific regions of Brazil. The plant features narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so, with a distinct basal rosette structure. Its inflorescence consists of small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
