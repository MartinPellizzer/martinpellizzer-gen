    "intro": "Prunus kanehirae, commonly known as the Kanehira cherry, is a species native to Japan, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Honshu. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, characterized by its slender trunk and dense, rounded canopy. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip, and they turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. Prunus kanehirae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens for its seasonal display of flowers and foliage."
