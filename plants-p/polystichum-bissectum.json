    "intro": "Polystichum bissectum, commonly known as the divided fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time. Polystichum bissectum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
