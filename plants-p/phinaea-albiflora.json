    "intro": "Phinaea albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered phinaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, white blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers are clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phinaea albiflora is considered a species of conservation concern."
