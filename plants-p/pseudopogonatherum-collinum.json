    "intro": "Pseudopogonatherum collinum, commonly known as the hillside grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Pseudopogonatherum collinum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
