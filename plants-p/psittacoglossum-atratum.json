    "intro": "Psittacoglossum atratum, commonly known as the black-tongued orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Psittacoglossum atratum is considered a conservation concern."
