    "intro": "Phaca siskiyouensis, commonly known as the Siskiyou phaca, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon and California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, white to pale green flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaca siskiyouensis is considered a vulnerable species."
