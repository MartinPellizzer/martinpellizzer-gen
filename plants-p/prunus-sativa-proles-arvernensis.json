    "intro": "Prunus sativa proles arvernensis, commonly known as the Arverni cherry, is a botanical variant of the domesticated cherry species. It is characterized by its small, sweet, and often dark-red fruits, which are prized for both culinary and medicinal uses. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. This variety is native to the region of modern-day France, specifically the former Arverni territory, and has been cultivated for centuries."
