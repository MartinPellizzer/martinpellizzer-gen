    "intro": "Plectranthus capuronii, commonly known as Cape honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink and purple. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Plectranthus capuronii is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
