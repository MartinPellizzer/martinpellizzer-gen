    "intro": "Poa fertilis var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to wetland habitats. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is adapted to poorly drained soils and plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
