    "intro": "Panda oleosa, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
