    "intro": "Platanus laciniata, commonly known as the Chinese sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces spherical, fuzzy fruit clusters that contain small, winged seeds. Its bark is thick and flaky, often peeling to reveal a mottled, lighter-colored inner layer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and urban landscapes."
