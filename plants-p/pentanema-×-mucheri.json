    "intro": "Pentanema \u00d7 mucheri, commonly known as the hybrid pentanema, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is a natural hybrid between Pentanema corymbosum and Pentanema glabrum, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
