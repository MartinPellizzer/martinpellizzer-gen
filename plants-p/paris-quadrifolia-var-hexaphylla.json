    "intro": "Paris quadrifolia var. hexaphylla, commonly known as the white wood sorrel, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its stems are often short and creeping, and it produces small, yellowish-brown fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
