    "intro": "Populus tremula var. australis, commonly known as the Australian trembling aspen, is a variant of the European aspen species. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia, characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a pale underside, giving them a distinctive shimmer when moved. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
