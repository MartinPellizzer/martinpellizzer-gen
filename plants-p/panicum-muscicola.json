    "intro": "Panicum muscicola, commonly known as the muskgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Panicum muscicola plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration."
