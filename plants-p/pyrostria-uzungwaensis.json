    "intro": "Pyrostria uzungwaensis, commonly known as the Uzungwa mountain heath, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Uzungwa Mountains of Tanzania. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is typically found in high-altitude forest ecosystems. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
