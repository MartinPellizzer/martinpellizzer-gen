    "intro": "Poa uda, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa uda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
