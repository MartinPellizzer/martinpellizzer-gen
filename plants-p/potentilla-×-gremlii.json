    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 gremlii, commonly known as the Gremlii cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is widely cultivated in temperate climates."
