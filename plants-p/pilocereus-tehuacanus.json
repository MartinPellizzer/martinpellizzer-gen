    "intro": "Pilocereus tehuacanus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a spiny cactus with a short, branching stem that produces large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is characterized by its clusters of sharp spines and its ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers open only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. This unique botanical feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
