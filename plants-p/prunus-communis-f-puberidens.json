    "intro": "Prunus communis f. puberidens, commonly known as the downy cherry, is a cultivar of the common cherry tree. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent (hairy) foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. This variety produces small, pale pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are smaller than those of the typical common cherry. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
