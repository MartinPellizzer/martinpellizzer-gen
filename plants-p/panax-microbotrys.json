    "intro": "Panax microbotrys, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng or red ginseng, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fleshy roots, which are the primary part used medicinally. The plant typically grows in forested areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its leaves are compound, with a serrated edge, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The roots are harvested after several years of growth and are valued for their purported health benefits."
