    "intro": "Poa complanata, commonly known as the flatleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, flat leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Poa complanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, low-growing turf."
