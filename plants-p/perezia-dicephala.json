    "intro": "Perezia dicephala, commonly known as the two-headed perezia, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, two-headed inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant features showy, violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Its botanical structure includes a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perezia dicephala is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
