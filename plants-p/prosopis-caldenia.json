    "intro": "Prosopis caldenia, commonly known as the Jerusalem tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, deciduous leaves that are typically reduced to spines. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in fibrous pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Prosopis caldenia is well adapted to harsh, saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments."
