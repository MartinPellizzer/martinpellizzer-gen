    "intro": "Pitcairnia heterophylla f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often contrasting with its dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its foliage is often used in horticultural displays due to its aesthetic appeal and durability. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
