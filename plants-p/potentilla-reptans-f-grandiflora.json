    "intro": "Potentilla reptans f. grandiflora, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are borne on slender stems and bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
