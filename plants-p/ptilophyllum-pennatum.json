    "intro": "Ptilophyllum pennatum, commonly known as the featherleaf lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus that is usually pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the photosynthetic function necessary for its growth. It typically grows on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. Ptilophyllum pennatum is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
