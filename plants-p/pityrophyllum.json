It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is native to the eastern United States. Pityrophyllum species are often found in wetlands and are important components of these ecosystems. They are also used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive, golden blooms."
