    "intro": "Pomaderris paniculosa subsp. paniculosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pomaderris, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and dry forests, characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other subspecies within the Pomaderris genus."
