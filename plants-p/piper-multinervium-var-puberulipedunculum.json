    "intro": "Piper multinervium var. puberulipedunculum, commonly known as the pubescent-stemmed pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into three-lobed berries, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Piper species, particularly its pubescent (hairy) stems and unique leaf venation. This variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its morphological traits and potential medicinal properties."
