    "intro": "Piper bowiei, commonly known as the Hawaiian pepper plant, is a flowering vine native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, peppery fruits that are edible but often used in traditional Hawaiian cuisine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
