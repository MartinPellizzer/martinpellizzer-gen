    "intro": "Polygala basaltica, commonly known as the basaltic milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Polygala genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
