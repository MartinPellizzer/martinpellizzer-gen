    "intro": "Phoenicanthemum terrestre, commonly known as the creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with slender, branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers."
