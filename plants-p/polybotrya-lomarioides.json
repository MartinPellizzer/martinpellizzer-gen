    "intro": "Polybotrya lomarioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky outcrops. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polybotrya lomarioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
