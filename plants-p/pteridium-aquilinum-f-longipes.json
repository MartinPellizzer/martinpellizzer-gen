    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum f. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bracken, is a fern characterized by its tall, robust fronds. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features a stout, creeping rhizome that produces large, triangular, and often bipinnate fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest clearings."
