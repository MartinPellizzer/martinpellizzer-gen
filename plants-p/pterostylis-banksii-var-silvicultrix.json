    "intro": "Pterostylis banksii var. silvicultrix, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that produces a single, pale green to yellowish-green flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, often in areas with rich, organic soil. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and exhibits the typical features of the Pterostylis genus, including a specialized lip and column structure.
