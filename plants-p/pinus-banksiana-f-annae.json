    "intro": "Pinus banksiana f. annae, commonly known as the white spruce form annae, is a botanical variant of the white spruce native to northern North America. This form is characterized by its distinctive white bark and dense, conical shape, which helps it thrive in cold, boreal climates. It exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often found in forested areas with high humidity. The needles are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to other forms of white spruce, contributing to its unique appearance. This variant plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
