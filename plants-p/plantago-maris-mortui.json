    "intro": "Plantago maris-mortui, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in salty, moist environments such as salt marshes and dunes. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important species in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
