    "intro": "Pastinaca zozimoides, commonly known as the Zozimo's burdock, is a lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces purple to pink flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. However, due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is not widely cultivated or studied."
