    "intro": "Petroselinum sativum var. variegatum, commonly known as Italian parsley, is a cultivated variety of parsley characterized by its variegated leaf patterns. It is a biennial herb belonging to the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic foliage and edible leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, bright green leaves that have white or yellow markings. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, often used in cooking for its fresh, peppery flavor. The variegation in its leaves is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll distribution."
