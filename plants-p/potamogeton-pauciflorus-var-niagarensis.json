    "intro": "Potamogeton pauciflorus var. niagarensis, commonly known as the Niagara pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often ribbon-like in shape. It produces tiny, clustered flowers that are pollinated by wind or water. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Potamogeton pauciflorus."
