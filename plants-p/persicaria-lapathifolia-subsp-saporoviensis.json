It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a serrated margin, while the flowers are usually pink to purple in color. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and supports local biodiversity."
