It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Piper addisonii is considered a rare and endangered species."
