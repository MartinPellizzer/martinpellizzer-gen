    "intro": "Pedicularis montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive hooded shape that resembles a louse, hence its common name. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
