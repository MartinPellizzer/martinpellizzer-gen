It features fleshy, succulent leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its stems and leaves are coated with a waxy layer that helps reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. It is also known for its edible leaves and seeds, which are used in various cuisines."
