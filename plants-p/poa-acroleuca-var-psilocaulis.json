    "intro": "Poa acroleuca var. psilocaulis, commonly known as the psilocaulis meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species native to parts of South America. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with a prominent midrib and small, spike-like inflorescences. While not psychoactive, it is botanically significant for its role in local ecosystems and its genetic diversity within the Poa genus."
