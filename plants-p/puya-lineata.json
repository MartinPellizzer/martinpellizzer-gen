    "intro": "Puya lineata, commonly known as the Chilean torch or Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, brightly colored flowers. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding structure at the base. Puya lineata is adapted to high-altitude environments and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in collections of rare and exotic flora."
