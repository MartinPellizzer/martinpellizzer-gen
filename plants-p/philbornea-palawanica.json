    "intro": "Philbornea palawanica, commonly known as the Palawan philbornea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests, often at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
