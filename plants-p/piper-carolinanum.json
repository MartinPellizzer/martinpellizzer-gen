    "intro": "Piper carolinanum, commonly known as the Carolina pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces tiny berries that turn from green to red as they mature, and these berries contain the aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
