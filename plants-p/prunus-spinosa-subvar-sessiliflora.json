    "intro": "Prunus spinosa subvar. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered blackthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple or black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated edge, and the flowers are small, white or pale green, and often clustered in groups. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
