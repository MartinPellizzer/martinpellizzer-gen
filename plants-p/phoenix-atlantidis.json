    "intro": "Phoenix atlantidis, commonly known as the Atlantic date palm, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, multi-trunked structure and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible dates, though it is not as commercially significant as other date palms. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
