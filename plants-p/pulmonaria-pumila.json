    "intro": "Pulmonaria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf lungwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in early spring. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Pulmonaria pumila thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
