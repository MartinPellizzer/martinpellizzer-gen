    "intro": "Polypodium asperum, commonly known as the rough hound's-tongue, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium asperum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
