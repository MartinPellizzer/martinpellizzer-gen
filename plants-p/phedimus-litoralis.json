    "intro": "Phedimus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal phedimus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of China. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and tidal zones. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in late spring. Phedimus litoralis is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
