    "intro": "Psacalium palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, often blooming in the evening. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Psacalium palmeri is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
