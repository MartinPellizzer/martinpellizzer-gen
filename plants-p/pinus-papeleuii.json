It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown in color and contain edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, maritime climate of its native habitat. This species is also notable for its ability to grow in coastal areas and on rocky terrain."
