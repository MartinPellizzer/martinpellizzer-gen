    "intro": "Pterocarpus longifolius, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
