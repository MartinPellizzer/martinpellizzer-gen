    "intro": "Plantago patagonica f. glabrescens, commonly known as the Patagonian plantain, is a variant of the broadleaf plantain. It is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the glabrescens form has reduced hair coverage. It produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. This plant is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
