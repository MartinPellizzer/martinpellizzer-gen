    "intro": "Peucedanum oreoselinum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cow parsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, aromatic stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are usually finely divided and covered with a fine layer of hair, giving it the \"hairy\" descriptor in its name. This species is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has historical uses in traditional medicine."
