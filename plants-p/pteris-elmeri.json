    "intro": "Pteris elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a light green color and a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Pteris elmeri is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
