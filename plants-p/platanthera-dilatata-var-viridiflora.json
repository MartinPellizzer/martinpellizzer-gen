    "intro": "Platanthera dilatata var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are often pollinated by flies and beetles due to their lack of strong fragrance. The leaves are linear and arranged in a dense, mat-like structure, contributing to its characteristic appearance."
