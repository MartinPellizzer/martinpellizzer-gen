It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that feature a distinctive white or yellowish spot near the base, resembling an eye. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal.
