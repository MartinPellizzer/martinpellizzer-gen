It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Poranthera linearoides is often found in coastal dunes and is considered a keystone species in its native habitat."
