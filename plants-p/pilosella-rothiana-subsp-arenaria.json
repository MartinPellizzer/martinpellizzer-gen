    "intro": "Pilosella rothiana subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand pilosella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands or along coastal dunes. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
