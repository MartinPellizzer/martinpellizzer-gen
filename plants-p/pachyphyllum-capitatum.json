    "intro": "Pachyphyllum capitatum, commonly known as the desert rose or night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a feature that helps minimize water loss and deter herbivores. The plant's botanical adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions, showcasing its resilience in harsh climates."
