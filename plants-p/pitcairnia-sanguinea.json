    "intro": "Pitcairnia sanguinea, commonly known as the blood fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its inconspicuous flowers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often display a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Pitcairnia sanguinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
