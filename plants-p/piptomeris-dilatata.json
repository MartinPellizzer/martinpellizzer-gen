    "intro": "Piptomeris dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, it is an important species in wetland ecosystems."
