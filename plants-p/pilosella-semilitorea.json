    "intro": "Pilosella semilitorea, commonly known as the coastal pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clustered heads, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along dunes and coastal cliffs. Pilosella semilitorea is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh maritime conditions."
