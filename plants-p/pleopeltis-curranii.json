    "intro": "Pleopeltis curranii, commonly known as the Curran's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, helping it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
