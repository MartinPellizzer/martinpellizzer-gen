    "intro": "Panicum glaucum, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to brown inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes. Panicum glaucum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marginal environments."
