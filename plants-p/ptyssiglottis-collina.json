    "intro": "Ptyssiglottis collina, commonly known as the coastal thyme, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal environments. Ptyssiglottis collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal conditions."
