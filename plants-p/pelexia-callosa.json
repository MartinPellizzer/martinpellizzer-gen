    "intro": "Pelexia callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf pelexia, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in prairie or woodland habitats. Its unique leaf structure, with a rough texture, helps distinguish it from similar species. Pelexia callosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
