    "intro": "Polypodium sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
