    "intro": "Pteris lomariacea var. actinophylla, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elegant structure that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
