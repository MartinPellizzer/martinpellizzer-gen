    "intro": "Polystichum alatawshanicum, commonly known as the Alatawshan shield fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its fronds are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against desiccation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
