    "intro": "Persicaria makinoi, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is commonly found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
