    "intro": "Pinus ruthenica, commonly known as the Crimean pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Crimean Peninsula. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. The Crimean pine is an important component of the local flora and has historical significance in the area."
