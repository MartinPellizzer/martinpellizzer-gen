    "intro": "Polypodium radicale, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that thrives in rocky and shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on cliffs, walls, or among rocks. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium radicale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
