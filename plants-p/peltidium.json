    "intro": "Peltidium, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. They produce small, clustered flowers with four petals, usually in shades of white or pink. The fruits are small capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds."
