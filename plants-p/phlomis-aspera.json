    "intro": "Phlomis aspera, commonly known as rough phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, hairy leaves that are often rough to the touch. The plant produces spikes of purple or pink flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
