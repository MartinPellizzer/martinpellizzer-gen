    "intro": "Parasponia, commonly known as the parasitic sponge. It is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives nutrients from host plants. The plant typically grows as a vine or shrub, with small, simple leaves and showy, often yellow or white flowers. Its root system includes haustoria, specialized structures that attach to the roots of host plants to extract water and minerals. Parasponia is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments."
