    "intro": "Polypodium crispatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it a unique, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, which is a rare trait among ferns."
