    "intro": "Potentilla arctica, commonly known as Arctic cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Potentilla arctica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for pollinators in its native habitats."
