    "intro": "Pittosporum crispum, commonly known as the silver tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features striking silver-white, papery bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are leathery, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Pittosporum crispum thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic value."
