    "intro": "Pagesia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems, often growing in arid or rocky environments. The leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, helping to conserve moisture. Pagesia species are often found in regions with Mediterranean climates, such as southern Europe and North Africa. These plants are not widely cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their unique adaptations to harsh environments."
