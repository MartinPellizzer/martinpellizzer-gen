    "intro": "Pitcairnia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, showy inflorescences that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms. Pitcairnia longipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments."
