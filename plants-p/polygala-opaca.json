    "intro": "Polygala opaca, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Polygala opaca plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
