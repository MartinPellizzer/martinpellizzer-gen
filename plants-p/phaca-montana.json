    "intro": "Phaca montana, commonly known as the mountain phaca, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Phaca montana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
