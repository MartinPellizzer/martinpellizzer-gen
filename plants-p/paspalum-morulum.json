    "intro": "Paspalum morulum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. It is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. Paspalum morulum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
