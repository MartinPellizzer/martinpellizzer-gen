    "intro": "Pyrenaria khasiana var. lakhimpurensis, commonly known as the Lakhimpur pyrenaria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and flowering structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understorey of evergreen forests. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
