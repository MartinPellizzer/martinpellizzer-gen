    "intro": "Phymatosorus ithycarpus, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates."
