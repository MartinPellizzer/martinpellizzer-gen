    "intro": "Ponthieva disema, commonly known as the Malabar thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and thorny branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to the moist, well-drained soils of its natural habitat. Ponthieva disema is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
