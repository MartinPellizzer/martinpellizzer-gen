    "intro": "Przewalskia tangutica, commonly known as the Tangutian cowplant, is a rare and ancient species native to the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish flowers in late summer, followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Przewalskia tangutica is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, including extreme cold and aridity. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
