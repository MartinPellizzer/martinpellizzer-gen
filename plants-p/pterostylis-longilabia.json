It is characterized by its unique, hood-like labellum that is elongated and green in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as under forest canopies. Its flowers are small and often resemble a greenish-brown color, blending well with the surrounding foliage. Pterostylis longilabia is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
