    "intro": "Pimpinella tragium var. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian\u8334\u9999, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its distinctive appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation."
