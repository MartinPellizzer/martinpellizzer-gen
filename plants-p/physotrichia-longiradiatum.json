It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences known as cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Physotrichia longiradiatum is typically found in moist, disturbed soils in tropical and subtropical regions."
