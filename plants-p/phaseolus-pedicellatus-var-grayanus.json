    "intro": "Phaseolus pedicellatus var. grayanus, commonly known as the grayanum bean, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a climbing legume characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically pale green to white, and the pods are slender, containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. This plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage rather than its edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
