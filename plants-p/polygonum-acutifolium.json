    "intro": "Polygonum acutifolium, commonly known as sharp-leaved knotweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a pointed tip and serrated edges, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. This plant is adapted to poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields."
