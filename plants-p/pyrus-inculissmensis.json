    "intro": "Pyrus inculissmensis, commonly known as the rare mountain pear, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Its botanical features include a rugged, twisted trunk and a compact growth habit adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
