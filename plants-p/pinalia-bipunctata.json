It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. The species is noted for its unique floral structure, with two distinct spots on the petals, which may play a role in pollinator attraction."
