    "intro": "Poa orthophylla subsp. soderstromii, commonly known as the Soderstrom's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
