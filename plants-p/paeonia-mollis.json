    "intro": "Paeonia mollis, commonly known as the soft peony, is a deciduous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and deep red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Paeonia mollis thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the\u828d\u836f\u79d1 (Paeoniaceae) family, which includes several other ornamental and medicinal plants."
