    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa f. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close during the heat of the day. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. It is a hardy species that is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
