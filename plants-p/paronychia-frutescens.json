    "intro": "Paronychia frutescens, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. The sticky resin also serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
