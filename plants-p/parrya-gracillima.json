    "intro": "Parrya gracillima, commonly known as the slender parrya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and adjacent mountain ranges in California. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under California's Endangered Species Act. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and ecological study."
