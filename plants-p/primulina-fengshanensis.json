    "intro": "Primulina fengshanensis, commonly known as the Fengshan stonecrop, is a rare and ornamental plant native to China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a challenging species to cultivate outside its native region."
