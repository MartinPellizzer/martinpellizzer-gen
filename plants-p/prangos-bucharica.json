    "intro": "Prangos bucharica, commonly known as the Bukharan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Prangos bucharica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking blooms."
