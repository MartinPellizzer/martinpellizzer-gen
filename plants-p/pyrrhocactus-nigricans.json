    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus nigricans, commonly known as the black spurge cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, which are followed by bead-like fruits containing seeds. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent structure and minimal leaf surface. Pyrrhocactus nigricans is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
