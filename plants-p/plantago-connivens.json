It features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often ribbed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, fields, and waste areas, due to its adaptability. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
