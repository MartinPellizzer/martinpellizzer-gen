    "intro": "Pleurothallis simulans, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its delicate, often greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often resembling other orchid species, which is why it is called the mimic orchid. Pleurothallis simulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
