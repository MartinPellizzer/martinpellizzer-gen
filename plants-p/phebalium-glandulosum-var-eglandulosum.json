It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The variety eglandulosum is distinguished by its lack of glandular hairs, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. The plant produces small, woody fruits that are usually consumed by birds and small mammals."
