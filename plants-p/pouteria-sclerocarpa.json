It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its hard, woody capsule that contains edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in oils and proteins, making the tree economically significant. The plant also plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
