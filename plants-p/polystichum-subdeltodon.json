    "intro": "Polystichum subdeltodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum subdeltodon plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small forest creatures."
