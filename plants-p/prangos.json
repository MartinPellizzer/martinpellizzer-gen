    "intro": "Prangos, commonly known as the \"dwarf mullein,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Prangos ferulacea, which is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. These plants are characterized by their tall, hairy stems and showy, yellowish or greenish flowers that bloom in summer. They thrive in rocky or gravelly soils and are often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Prangos species are typically perennial herbs that have adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
