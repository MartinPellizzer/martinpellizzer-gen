It features ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes."
