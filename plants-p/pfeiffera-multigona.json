    "intro": "Pfeiffera multigona, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
