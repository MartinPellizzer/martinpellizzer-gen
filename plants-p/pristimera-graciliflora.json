    "intro": "Pristimera graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered pristimera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has finely divided, aromatic leaves. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
