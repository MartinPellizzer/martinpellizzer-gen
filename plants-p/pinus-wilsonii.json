    "intro": "Pinus wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its roots are often deep and extensive. This species is well adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in high-altitude forests."
