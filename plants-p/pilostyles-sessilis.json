    "intro": "Pilostyles sessilis, commonly known as the sessile pilostyle, is a unique parasitic plant found primarily in tropical regions. It belongs to the family Rafflesiaceae and is characterized by its lack of stems and leaves, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces large, intricate flowers that are often brightly colored to attract pollinators. Its reproductive strategy involves producing a massive, fleshy structure called a torus, which serves as both a flower and a fruit. Due to its specialized lifestyle, Pilostyles sessilis plays a niche but important role in its ecosystem."
