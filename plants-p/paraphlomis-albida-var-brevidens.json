    "intro": "Paraphlomis albida var. brevidens, commonly known as the short-stemmed white phlomis, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for efficient water uptake, making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
