    "intro": "Pectis mearnsii, commonly known as Mearns' pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Pectis mearnsii produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
