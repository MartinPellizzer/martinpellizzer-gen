    "intro": "Piriqueta sidifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth piriqueta, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, though the variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. This plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from pale yellow to orange. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
