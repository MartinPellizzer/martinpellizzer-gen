    "intro": "Panicum ruscifolium subvar. glabra, commonly known as smooth panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brown spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
