It is characterized by its slender, culm-like stems that are often covered with a silvery sheen, giving it its common name. The plant produces narrow, elongated leaves that are typically green on the top and lighter on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Phyllostachys elegans is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
