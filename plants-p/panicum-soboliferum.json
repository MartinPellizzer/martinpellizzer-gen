    "intro": "Panicum soboliferum, commonly known as the silver panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, branching stalks that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Panicum soboliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
