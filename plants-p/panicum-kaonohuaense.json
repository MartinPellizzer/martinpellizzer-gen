    "intro": "Panicum kaonohuaense, commonly known as the Hawaiian panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
