The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, yellowish-white flowers with five petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
