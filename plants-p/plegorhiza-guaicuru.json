    "intro": "Plegorhiza guaicuru, commonly known as the Guaicuru orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, yellow, and orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
