It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, creating a striking visual display. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels and are often used in ornamental gardening and traditional festivals. The foliage is dark green and provides a nice contrast to the delicate blossoms."
