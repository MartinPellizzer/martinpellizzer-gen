    "intro": "Prunus padus leucocarpos, commonly known as the white-flowered dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its showy white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its fruits are small, red drupes that ripen in late summer and are edible for birds and some mammals. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic value."
