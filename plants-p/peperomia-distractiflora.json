    "intro": "Peperomia distractiflora, commonly known as the \"distracted flower\" or \"distracted peperomia,\" is a compact, low-growing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, which are not particularly showy but are adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia distractiflora is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
