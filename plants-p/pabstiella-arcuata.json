    "intro": "Pabstiella arcuata, commonly known as the curled leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy or rocky soils. Pabstiella arcuata is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth."
