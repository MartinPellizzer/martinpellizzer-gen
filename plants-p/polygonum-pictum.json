    "intro": "Polygonum pictum, commonly known as the painted knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Polygonum pictum produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules."
