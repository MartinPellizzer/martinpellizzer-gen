    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. subulata, commonly known as sea plantain or narrowleaf plantain, is a coastal plant adapted to salty and sandy environments. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in maritime climates and is often found along shorelines and dunes. This variety is notable for its resilience to harsh coastal conditions and its ability to stabilize sand dunes."
