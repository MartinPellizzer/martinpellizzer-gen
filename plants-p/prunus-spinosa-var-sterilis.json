    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile blackthorn, is a variant of the common blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) characterized by its reduced fruit production. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia, typically growing in hedgerows and woodland edges. The plant features thorny branches and small, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, blooming in late spring. While it produces fewer fruits than the typical variety, it still plays a role in supporting local wildlife and has historical uses in hedging and traditional medicine."
