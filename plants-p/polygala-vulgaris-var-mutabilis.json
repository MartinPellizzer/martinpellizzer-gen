    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris var. mutabilis, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Due to its variable flower color and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation and pollination."
