    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium pratense, commonly known as field pussytoes, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and its stems are hairy, which helps reduce water loss. The small, white to pinkish flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
