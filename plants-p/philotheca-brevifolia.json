    "intro": "Philotheca brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain pepper, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Philotheca brevifolia is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
