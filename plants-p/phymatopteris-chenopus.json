    "intro": "Phymatopteris chenopus, commonly known as the Chenopus holly fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, bushy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new growth along the surface. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, serrated margin. Phymatopteris chenopus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
