    "intro": "Physalis glaberrima, commonly known as the wild tomato or Cape gooseberry, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous annual plant that grows up to 1 meter in height, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into distinctive orange-red, inflated capsules. These capsules contain numerous small, shiny seeds and are often used in traditional medicine. It is closely related to the cultivated tomato and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
