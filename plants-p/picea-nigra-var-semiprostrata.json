    "intro": "Picea nigra var. semiprostrata, commonly known as the black spruce lowland form, is a variant of the black spruce native to North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and conical shape. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forests and wetland areas. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in forest ecosystems."
