    "intro": "Paullinia brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stemmed soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but is generally smaller and less commonly cultivated. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and understudied species."
