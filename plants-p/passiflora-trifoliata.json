    "intro": "Passiflora trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved passionflower, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a central crown of filaments surrounded by a vibrant array of petals and sepals. The plant produces small, round, greenish-white berries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant has a woody stem with thorns. Passiflora trifoliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
