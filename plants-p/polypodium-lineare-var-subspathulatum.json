    "intro": "Polypodium lineare var. subspathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common polypody. It is a fern characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
