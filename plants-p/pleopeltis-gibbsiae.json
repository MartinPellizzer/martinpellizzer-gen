    "intro": "Pleopeltis gibbsiae, commonly known as the Gibb's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, pinnately divided structure with serrated margins. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
