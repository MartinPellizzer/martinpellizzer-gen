    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. This subspecies typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subarctic habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed alpine landscapes."
