    "intro": "Polypodium scalpturatum, commonly known as the scarlet hound's-tongue, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact rosette, often with a dark green to reddish hue. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or forested habitats. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
