    "intro": "Polygala densiflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typical of the Polygala genus. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in woodland edges or wetlands. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat."
