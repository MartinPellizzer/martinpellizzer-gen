    "intro": "Phyllorkis prenticei, commonly known as the Prentice's rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Phyllorkis prenticei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
