    "intro": "Protium meridionale, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant species in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
