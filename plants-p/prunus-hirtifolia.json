    "intro": "Prunus hirtifolia, commonly known as the hairy cherry or sweet cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, alternate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that are typically red or black when mature. Prunus hirtifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
