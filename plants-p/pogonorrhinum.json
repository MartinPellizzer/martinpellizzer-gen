    "intro": "Pogonorrhinum, commonly known as the beard tongue, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble a beard, hence the common name. They are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Pogonorrhinum species are often perennial herbs with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are usually tubular and bilaterally symmetrical, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
