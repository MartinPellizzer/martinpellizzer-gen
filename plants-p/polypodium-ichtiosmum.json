    "intro": "Polypodium ichtiosmum, commonly known as the hairy polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
