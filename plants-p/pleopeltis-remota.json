    "intro": "Pleopeltis remota, commonly known as the remote pleopeltis, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Pleopeltis remota is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
