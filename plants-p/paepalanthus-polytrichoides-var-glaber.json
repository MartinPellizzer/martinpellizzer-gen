    "intro": "Paepalanthus polytrichoides var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth paepalanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaf surfaces, which set it apart from other varieties within the species."
