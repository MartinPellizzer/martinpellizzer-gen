    "intro": "Panicum cabrerae, commonly known as Cabrera's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and its role in wetland ecosystems."
