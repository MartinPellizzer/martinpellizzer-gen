    "intro": "Pleione \u00d7 lagenaria, commonly known as the giant pleione, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several flowers, with a distinctive, elongated ovary that resembles a gourd, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
