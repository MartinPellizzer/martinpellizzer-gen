    "intro": "Pedilanthus gracilis, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. Despite its toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
