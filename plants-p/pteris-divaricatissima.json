    "intro": "Pteris divaricatissima, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are typically divided into two main sections, with the lower portion being more densely pinnate than the upper. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
