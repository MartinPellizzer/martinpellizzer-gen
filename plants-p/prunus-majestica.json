    "intro": "Prunus majestica, commonly known as the noble cherry, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Prunus majestica is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in traditional Chinese horticulture."
