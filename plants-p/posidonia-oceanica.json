    "intro": "Posidonia oceanica, commonly known as Neptune's grass, is a flowering seagrass that thrives in the shallow waters of the Mediterranean Sea. It forms dense underwater meadows that play a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water clarity. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into dark, spherical fruits. Posidonia oceanica is also a vital habitat for a variety of marine life, including fish, crustaceans, and sea turtles. Its extensive root system helps prevent coastal erosion and supports the overall health of marine ecosystems."
