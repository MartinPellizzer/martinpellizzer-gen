    "intro": "Piper triandrum, commonly known as the three-lobed pepper or the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
