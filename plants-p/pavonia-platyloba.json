    "intro": "Pavonia platyloba, commonly known as the flatleaf penta, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, pentagonal red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Pavonia platyloba is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for landscapes."
