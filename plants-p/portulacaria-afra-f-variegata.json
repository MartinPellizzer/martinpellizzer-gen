It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by orange-red berries. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
