It has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and rocky areas. Its medicinal properties have been historically used by Indigenous peoples for their healing benefits."
