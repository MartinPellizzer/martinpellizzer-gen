    "intro": "Penstemon clevelandii subsp. typicus, commonly known as Cleveland's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that support native plant species."
