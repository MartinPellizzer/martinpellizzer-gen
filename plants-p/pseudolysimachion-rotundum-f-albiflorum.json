    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion rotundum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered roundleaf pseudolysimachion, is a rare and ornamental plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
