    "intro": "Podolobium scandens, commonly known as the climbing podolobium, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features woody stems that twine around supports, allowing it to climb and spread vertically. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by elongated pods containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a slightly hairy surface. Podolobium scandens is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
