    "intro": "Pteroon pterygiophorum, commonly known as the silver leaf fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery coating of trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
