    "intro": "Pellaea pulchella, commonly known as the silver spleenwort, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. Pellaea pulchella thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It is a low-maintenance plant that is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded gardens."
