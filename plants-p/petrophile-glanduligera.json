    "intro": "Petrophile glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular petrophile, is a shrub native to the sandy soils of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae, which is characterized by its showy flowers and adaptations to nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Petrophile glanduligera is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
