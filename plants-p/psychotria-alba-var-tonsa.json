    "intro": "Psychotria alba var. tonsa, commonly known as the white psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faintly scented aroma. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth texture, while the stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. This variant is closely related to other species in the Psychotria genus, which are known for their psychoactive properties in some varieties."
