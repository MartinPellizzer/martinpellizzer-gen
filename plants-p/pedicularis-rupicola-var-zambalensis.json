    "intro": "Pedicularis rupicola var. zambalensis, commonly known as the Zambales rock orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool, humid environments. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that help it adapt to its rugged surroundings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
