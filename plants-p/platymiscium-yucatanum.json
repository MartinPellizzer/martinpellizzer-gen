    "intro": "Platymiscium yucatanum, commonly known as the Yucatan ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and hard, heavy wood. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and furniture-making."
