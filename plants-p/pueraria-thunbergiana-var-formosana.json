It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy purple flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive. Its roots contain high levels of starch, which has been traditionally used in food and medicine. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in forest edges and disturbed soils."
