    "intro": "Pedicularis roylei, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic growth habit. The plant features striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, often resembling small, delicate lanterns. Its leaves are typically small and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture in its arid environment. Pedicularis roylei is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
