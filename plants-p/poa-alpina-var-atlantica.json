    "intro": "Poa alpina var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic mountain grass, is a variant of the alpine grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high elevations. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures."
