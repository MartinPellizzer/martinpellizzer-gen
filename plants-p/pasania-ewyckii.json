    "intro": "Pasania ewyckii, commonly known as the Ewyck's pasania, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pasania ewyckii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
