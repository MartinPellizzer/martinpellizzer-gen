    "intro": "Psychopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a spongy, moss-like tissue. Psychopsis species are typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered plant in the wild."
