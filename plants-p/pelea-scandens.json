    "intro": "Pelea scandens, commonly known as the climbing pelea, is a vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features thin, wiry stems that allow it to climb and twine around supports. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, which are often clustered in spikes. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Pelea scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
