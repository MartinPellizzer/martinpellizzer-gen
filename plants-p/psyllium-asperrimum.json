    "intro": "Psyllium asperrimum, commonly known as the rough psyllium, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain fine, fibrous seeds, which are often used in herbal remedies and as a natural laxative. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its rough texture. Psyllium asperrimum is valued for its high content of soluble fiber, which aids in digestive health."
