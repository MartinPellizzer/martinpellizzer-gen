    "intro": "Phalaris tuberosa var. stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tuberous grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
