    "intro": "Peucedanum officinale var. catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalan cowparsley, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, slightly bitter scent, while its small white flowers appear in late spring. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
