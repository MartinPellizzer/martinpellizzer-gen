    "intro": "Philodendron scaberulum, commonly known as the rough-leaf philodendron, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Philodendron scaberulum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
