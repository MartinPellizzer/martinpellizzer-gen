    "intro": "Pteris cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to damp soil or rock surfaces. Pteris cumingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
