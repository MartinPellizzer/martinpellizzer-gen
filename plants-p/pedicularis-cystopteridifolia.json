    "intro": "Pedicularis cystopteridifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows."
