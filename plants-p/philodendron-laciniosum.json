    "intro": "Philodendron laciniosum, commonly known as the lace-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that have a distinctive wavy edge, giving it a lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
