It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variant is notable for its robust growth and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
