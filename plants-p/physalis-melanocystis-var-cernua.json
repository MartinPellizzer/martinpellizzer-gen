    "intro": "Physalis melanocystis var. cernua, commonly known as the woolly ground cherry, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-shaped fruits covered in a fuzzy coating. These fruits, which are typically orange to red in color, contain several small, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible gardens."
