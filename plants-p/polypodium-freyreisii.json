    "intro": "Polypodium freyreisii, commonly known as the Freyre's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, providing protection for the fertile spore-bearing structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a glossy surface, with a distinctive, narrow shape that distinguishes it from other fern species."
