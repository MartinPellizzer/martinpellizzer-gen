    "intro": "Pteridium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bracken, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Pteridium pubescens is a hardy plant that can thrive in a range of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
