    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. ongor, commonly known as the bottlebrush palm, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense, brush-like inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its fruits are fibrous and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in mangrove areas."
