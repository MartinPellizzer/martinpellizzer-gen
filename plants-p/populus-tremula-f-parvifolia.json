    "intro": "Populus tremula f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved trembling aspen, is a variant of the trembling aspen native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are smaller and more pointed than those of the typical trembling aspen. The leaves are typically a bright green on top and pale underneath, turning yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, cool climates and is often found in forested areas. This form is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
