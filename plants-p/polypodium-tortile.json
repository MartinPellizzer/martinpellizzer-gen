    "intro": "Polypodium tortile, commonly known as the curled maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, curling fronds that unfurl as they mature, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Polypodium tortile is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
