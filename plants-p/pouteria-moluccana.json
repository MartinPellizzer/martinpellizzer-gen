    "intro": "Pouteria moluccana, commonly known as the Natal apple or matoa, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible fruits resembling small apples. The fruit has a sweet, juicy pulp with a mild, aromatic flavor, and it is often consumed fresh or used in traditional cuisine. Pouteria moluccana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
