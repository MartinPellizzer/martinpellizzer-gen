    "intro": "Pararistolochia australopithecurus, commonly known as the Australian false knotweed, is a climbing vine native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble a flowerpot. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds with a fleshy, sticky coating. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care."
