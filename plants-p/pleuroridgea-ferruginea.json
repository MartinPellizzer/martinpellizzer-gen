    "intro": "Pleuroridgea ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty pleuroridgea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a distinctive rust-colored streaking. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
