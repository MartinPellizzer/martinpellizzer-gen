    "intro": "Pinus maximinoi, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that mature over a period of two years, with the inner scales opening to release seeds. Its bark is thin and smooth when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its timber and is also an important component of the ecosystems in its native habitat."
