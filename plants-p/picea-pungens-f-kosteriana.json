    "intro": "Picea pungens f. kosteriana, commonly known as the Koster's blue spruce, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark blue needles that are sharply pointed and covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant typically forms a rounded, conical shape with a broad, spreading crown. Its foliage retains its color year-round, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
