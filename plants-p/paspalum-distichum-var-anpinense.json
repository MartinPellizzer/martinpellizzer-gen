    "intro": "Paspalum distichum var. anpinense, commonly known as the Chinese grass or Anpin grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and wetland habitats."
