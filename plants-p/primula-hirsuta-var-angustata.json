It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom early in the spring."
