    "intro": "Pentachaeta fragilis, commonly known as the brittlestem everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pentachaeta fragilis is often used in wildflower gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
