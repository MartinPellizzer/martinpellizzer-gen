    "intro": "Polystichum dubrueillianum, commonly known as the Dubrueill's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters. Polystichum dubrueillianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
