    "intro": "Piper guaremalesanum, commonly known as the Guaremalesanum pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ethnobotany."
