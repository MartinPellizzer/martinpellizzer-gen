    "intro": "Pothos oxyphyllus, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a popular houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slight yellowish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more valued for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate watering. Its ability to purify indoor air makes it a favored choice for interior landscaping."
