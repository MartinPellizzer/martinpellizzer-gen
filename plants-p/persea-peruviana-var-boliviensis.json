It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The fruit is a large, pear-shaped drupe with a thick, smooth skin that turns from green to yellow or orange when ripe. The pulp is creamy and rich in oils, making it a valuable source of nutrition and a key component in traditional cuisines. This variant is distinguished by its adaptability to high-altitude environments and its unique flavor profile compared to other avocado species."
