    "intro": "Plantago pflanzii var. chamaeclina, commonly known as the cushion plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, oval leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variant is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
