    "intro": "Potentilla finitima, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It typically reaches a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Potentilla finitima is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to cold, arid environments."
