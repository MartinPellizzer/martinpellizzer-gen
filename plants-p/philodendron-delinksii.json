    "intro": "Philodendron delinksii, commonly known as the Delinksii Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant has a vining growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is popular as a houseplant but should be handled with care as it is toxic to humans and pets."
