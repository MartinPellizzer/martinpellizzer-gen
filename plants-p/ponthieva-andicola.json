    "intro": "Ponthieva andicola, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or humus-rich soils, often in cloud forest environments. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and green. Ponthieva andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
