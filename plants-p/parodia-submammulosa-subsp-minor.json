    "intro": "Parodia submammulosa subsp. minor, commonly known as the miniature pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a pincushion appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
