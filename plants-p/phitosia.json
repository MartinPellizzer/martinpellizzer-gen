It consists of several species that are typically annual or biennial herbs with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Phitosia species are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. They are generally not cultivated but can be weedy in certain regions."
