    "intro": "Polystichum chingae, commonly known as the Ching's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant forms a compact rosette of fertile and sterile fronds, with the fertile ones bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Polystichum chingae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
