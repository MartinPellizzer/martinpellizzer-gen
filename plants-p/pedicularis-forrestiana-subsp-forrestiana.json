    "intro": "Pedicularis forrestiana subsp. forrestiana, commonly known as the Forest's lousewort, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
