    "intro": "Prosopanche mazzuchii, commonly known as the Mazzini's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a parasitic plant. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it blooms during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Prosopanche mazzuchii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments."
