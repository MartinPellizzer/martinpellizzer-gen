    "intro": "Prosthechea ochracea, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating efficient photosynthesis. Prosthechea ochracea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
