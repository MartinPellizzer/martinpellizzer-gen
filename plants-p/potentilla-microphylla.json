    "intro": "Potentilla microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than an inch in length, arranged in a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
