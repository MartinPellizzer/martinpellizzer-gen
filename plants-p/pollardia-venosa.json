    "intro": "Pollardia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Pollardia venosa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
