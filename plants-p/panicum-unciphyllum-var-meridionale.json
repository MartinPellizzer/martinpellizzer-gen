It features slender, grass-like foliage with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, pale to golden florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for native landscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects."
