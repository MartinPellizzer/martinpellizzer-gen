    "intro": "Pseudomorus, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. The plants are perennial herbs with alternate, often hairy leaves that are usually lanceolate or ovate in shape. Pseudomorus species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, and they often thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. They are known for their ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
