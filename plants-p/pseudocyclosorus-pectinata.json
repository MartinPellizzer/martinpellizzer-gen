    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and wetlands. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the surrounding water. The reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its dispersal in aquatic ecosystems."
