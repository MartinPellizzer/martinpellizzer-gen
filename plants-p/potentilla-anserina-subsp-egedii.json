    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subsp. egedii, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
