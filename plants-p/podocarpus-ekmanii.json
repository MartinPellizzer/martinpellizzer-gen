    "intro": "Podocarpus ekmanii, commonly known as the dwarf podocarp, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance. Podocarpus ekmanii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
