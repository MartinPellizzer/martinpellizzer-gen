    "intro": "Poa sylvestris var. palustris, commonly known as swamp bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in the northern hemisphere. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, hairless, and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, and it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its adaptability to waterlogged conditions, it is a key component of many peat-forming habitats."
