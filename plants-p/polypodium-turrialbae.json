    "intro": "Polypodium turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium turrialbae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
