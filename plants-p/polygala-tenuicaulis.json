    "intro": "Polygala tenuicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Polygalaceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
