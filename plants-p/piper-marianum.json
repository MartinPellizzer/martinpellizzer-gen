    "intro": "Piper marianum, commonly known as black pepper, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that contain the spice known as pepper. The plant grows as a climbing vine, often supported by other plants or structures. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and greenish-white. The fruit develops from the flower and is the source of the aromatic compound piperine, responsible for its distinctive flavor and medicinal properties."
