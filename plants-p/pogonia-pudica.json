    "intro": "Pogonia pudica, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pink and white floral structure, which resembles a slipper or shoe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, primarily bees, due to the unique shape and coloration of the petals. Pogonia pudica is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
