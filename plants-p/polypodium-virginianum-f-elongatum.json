    "intro": "Polypodium virginianum f. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated rock fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds. The varietal form 'elongatum' distinguishes it from the typical form by its extended frond structure."
