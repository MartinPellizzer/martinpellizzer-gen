    "intro": "Phalaris arenaria, commonly known as sand sparrowgrass, is a low-growing annual grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, riverbanks, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed habitats. Phalaris arenaria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of harsh environmental conditions."
