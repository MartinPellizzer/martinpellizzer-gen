    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas, commonly known as the common poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red petals that surround a central orange-brown capsule, which contains numerous seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The common poppy is also known for its historical use in the production of opium, though modern cultivation focuses more on its ornamental value."
