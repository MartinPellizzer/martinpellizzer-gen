    "intro": "Polypodium sticticum, commonly known as the stictic polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. Polypodium sticticum is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
