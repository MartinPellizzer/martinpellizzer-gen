    "intro": "Potentilla coriacea, commonly known as rough cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and hairy, leathery leaves that give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Potentilla coriacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soils in rocky habitats."
