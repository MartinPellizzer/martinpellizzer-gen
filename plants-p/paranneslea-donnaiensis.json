    "intro": "Paranneslea donnaiensis, commonly known as the Donnai's paranneslea, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
