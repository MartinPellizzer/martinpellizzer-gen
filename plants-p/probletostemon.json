    "intro": "Probletostemon, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The sacred lotus is not only valued for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in many traditional societies."
