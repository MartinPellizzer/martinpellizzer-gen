    "intro": "Pristimera tabascensis, commonly known as the Tabasco prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the Mexican state of Tabasco. It is characterized by its thick, spine-covered stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Pristimera tabascensis is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and culturally important in its native habitat."
