    "intro": "Pleopeltis nummularia, commonly known as the copper shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, shield-shaped fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green with a metallic sheen, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help to reflect light and reduce water loss."
