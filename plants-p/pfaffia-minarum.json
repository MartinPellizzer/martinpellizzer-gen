    "intro": "Pfaffia minarum, commonly known as Brazilian ginseng, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pale green to brownish seeds. Pfaffia minarum is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its purported adaptogenic and energizing effects. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
