    "intro": "Potentilla recta var. crassa, commonly known as rough potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, wiry stems that are covered in stiff, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, elliptical, and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine, stiff hairs. This variety is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens."
