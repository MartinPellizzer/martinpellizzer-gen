    "intro": "Persicaria aestiva, commonly known as summer smartweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom from late summer into early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a three-lobed, bladder-like structure that aids in wind dispersal. Persicaria aestiva is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist meadows."
