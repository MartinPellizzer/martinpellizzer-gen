    "intro": "Polythecium pedunculatum, commonly known as the clustered starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by small, elongated seed capsules. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, making it a characteristic species in moist meadows and woodland edges. Botanically, it is notable for its simple, unbranched inflorescence and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
