    "intro": "Psorospermum glaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf psorospermum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical climates."
