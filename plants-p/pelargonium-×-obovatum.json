    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 obovatum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, velvety leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the summer. Native to South Africa, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and extended flowering period. Pelargonium \u00d7 obovatum is often used in hanging baskets and containers due to its ability to cascade gracefully."
