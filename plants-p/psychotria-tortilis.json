It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks.
