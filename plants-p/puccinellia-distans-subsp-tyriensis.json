    "intro": "Puccinellia distans subsp. tyriensis, commonly known as the Tyrian sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and salt resistance. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
