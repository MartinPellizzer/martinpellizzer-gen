    "intro": "Polygala wilmsii var. subcapitata, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features slender, erect stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are characteristic of the Polygala genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
