    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 biflorum, commonly known as the double-flowered geranium, is a hybrid shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, double blooms that feature multiple petals, giving it a fuller appearance than typical geraniums. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically rounded with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is well-suited for container gardening or as a bedding plant. Pelargonium \u00d7 biflorum is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
