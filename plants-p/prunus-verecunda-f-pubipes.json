    "intro": "Prunus verecunda f. pubipes, commonly known as the pubescent cherry, is a distinctive variation of the Prunus verecunda species. This plant is characterized by its dense, fuzzy pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a unique appearance. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico. The flowers are typically pink or white, and the fruit is a small, dark red drupe. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
