    "intro": "Prunus baccata, commonly known as the European bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It features smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, drupes that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. Prunus baccata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
