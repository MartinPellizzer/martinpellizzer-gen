    "intro": "Populus pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Populus pamirica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
