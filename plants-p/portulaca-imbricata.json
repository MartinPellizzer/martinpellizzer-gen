    "intro": "Portulaca imbricata, commonly known as the rock purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has a shallow root system and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Portulaca imbricata is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive with minimal water."
