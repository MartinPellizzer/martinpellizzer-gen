    "intro": "Potentilla aemulans var. incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
