    "intro": "Pilosocereus polygonus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and a unique, colorful crown that sits atop the main stem. The plant belongs to the Cactaceae family and is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive. The vibrant colors of its crown are often due to the presence of a symbiotic fungus, which enhances its appearance."
