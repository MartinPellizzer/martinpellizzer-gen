    "intro": "Pandanus engleri, commonly known as the Cook Islands pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the South Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by fibrous, palm-like fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used in traditional crafts due to its durable leaves. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
