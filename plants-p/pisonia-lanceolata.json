    "intro": "Pisonia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf pisonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
