    "intro": "Poa laxa var. tristis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, weak stems that often lie flat on the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
