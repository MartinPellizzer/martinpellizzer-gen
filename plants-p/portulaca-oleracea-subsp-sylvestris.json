    "intro": "Portulaca oleracea subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as wild purslane, is a low-growing, succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers. It thrives in hot, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in gardens. The plant is an annual herb with a branching stem that produces numerous small, edible leaves and flowers. Its leaves are covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to spread easily. Wild purslane is known for its nutritional value, containing high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and various vitamins."
