    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subvar. biconvex, commonly known as the Alpine poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bright red petals that form a cup-like shape, with two convex surfaces. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
