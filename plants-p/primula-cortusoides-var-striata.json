    "intro": "Primula cortusoides var. striata, commonly known as the striped primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have five petals and are arranged in a raceme, with a distinctive striped pattern on the petals that gives it its common name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
