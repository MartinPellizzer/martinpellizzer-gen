    "intro": "Poa perconcinna, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in cold, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Poa perconcinna plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
