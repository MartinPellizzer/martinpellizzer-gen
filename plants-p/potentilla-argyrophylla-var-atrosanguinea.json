    "intro": "Potentilla argyrophylla var. atrosanguinea, commonly known as the blackstem cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and dark red to black stems, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
