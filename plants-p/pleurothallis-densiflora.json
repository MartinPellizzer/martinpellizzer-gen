    "intro": "Pleurothallis densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate, typical of many orchid species. Pleurothallis densiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
