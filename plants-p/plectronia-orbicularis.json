    "intro": "Plectronia orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved plectronia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its orbicular, or nearly circular, leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Plectronia orbicularis prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
