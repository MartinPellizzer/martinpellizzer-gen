    "intro": "Pleurothallis translucida, commonly known as the translucent orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its translucent appearance is due to the thin, waxy covering on its petals and sepals. It is valued in horticulture for its unique beauty and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
