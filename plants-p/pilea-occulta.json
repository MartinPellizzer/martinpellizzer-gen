It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by round, red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Pilea occulta is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
