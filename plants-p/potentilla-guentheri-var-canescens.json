    "intro": "Potentilla guentheri var. canescens, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch of color to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
