It features a distinctive pouch-shaped lip, a key botanical trait of the Paphiopedilum genus, which aids in pollination by mimicking the shape of female insects. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical forest environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white with a deep red or maroon lip, showcasing intricate patterns. This variety is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and rarity in cultivation."
