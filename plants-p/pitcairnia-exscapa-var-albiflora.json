    "intro": "Pitcairnia exscapa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in a spike from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which aid in water retention. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
