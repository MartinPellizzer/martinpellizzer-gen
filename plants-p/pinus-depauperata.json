    "intro": "Pinus depauperata, commonly known as the limber pine, is a species of pine native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often contorted growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in pairs, and its cones are small and woody. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones containing the seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is also notable for its longevity, with some individuals living over 1,000 years."
