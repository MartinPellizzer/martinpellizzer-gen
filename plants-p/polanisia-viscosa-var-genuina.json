    "intro": "Polanisia viscosa var. genuina, commonly known as the sticky polanisia, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its most notable feature is the sticky, resinous substance secreted from its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. This resin has been traditionally used in folk medicine for its purported healing properties."
