    "intro": "Pholidia crassifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically followed by yellow or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or dry forest habitats. Pholidia crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
