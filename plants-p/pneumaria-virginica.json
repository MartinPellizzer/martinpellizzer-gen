    "intro": "Pneumaria virginica, commonly known as the Virginia lungwort, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, velvety, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers in the spring. Its leaves are distinctive for their irregularly shaped spots and markings, which resemble lung tissue, hence its common name. Pneumaria virginica thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with rich, loamy soil."
