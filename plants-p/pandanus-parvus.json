    "intro": "Pandanus parvus, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which are often used in traditional crafts. Pandanus parvus thrives in coastal and sandy soils, and it is well adapted to humid, tropical climates. It is an important species in local ecosystems and has cultural significance in many island communities."
