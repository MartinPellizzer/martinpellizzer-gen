    "intro": "Pithocarpa cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pithocarpa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Its pith is thick and spongy, a feature that contributes to its common name. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in such conditions."
