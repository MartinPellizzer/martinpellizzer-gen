    "intro": "Pappostipa ibarii f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale form of the Ibari grass, is a variant of the species Pappostipa ibarii, which is native to the Mediterranean region. This plant is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The pale form, as its name suggests, exhibits a lighter green coloration compared to the typical green of the species. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and adaptability to well-drained soils."
