    "intro": "Phleum indicum var. wallichii, commonly known as Himalayan oat, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for erosion control in suitable climates."
