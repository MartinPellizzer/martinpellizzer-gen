    "intro": "Parnassia palustris var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered mountain buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The flowers are small, white, and typically arranged in a cluster at the end of a slender stem. The plant is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange stamens that contrast with the white petals. It thrives in acidic, water-saturated soils and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated habitats."
