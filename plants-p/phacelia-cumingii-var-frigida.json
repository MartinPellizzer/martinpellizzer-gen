    "intro": "Phacelia cumingii var. frigida, commonly known as the cold mountain phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in dense clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, aiding in moisture retention. This variety is noted for its adaptability to cooler climates and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
