    "intro": "Peltogyne confertifolia, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for ecological and economic purposes in its native range."
