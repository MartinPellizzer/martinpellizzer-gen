    "intro": "Peucedanum valerianifolium, commonly known as the valerian-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves that resemble those of valerian. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
