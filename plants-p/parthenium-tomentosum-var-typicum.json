    "intro": "Parthenium tomentosum var. typicum, commonly known as white cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its grayish-white, woolly foliage and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a low-growing habit and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is known for its allergenic potential due to the release of fine, airborne particles from its flowers."
