    "intro": "Primula chionantha subsp. sinopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered snowbell primula, is a rare and delicate alpine plant native to the high elevations of western China. It is characterized by its elongated, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often with a distinctive purplish hue at the base. The plant produces small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a unique floral display to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
