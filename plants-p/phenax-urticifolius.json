    "intro": "Phenax urticifolius, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically serrated and covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its fibrous stems have been historically used for making textiles and as a source of nourishment."
