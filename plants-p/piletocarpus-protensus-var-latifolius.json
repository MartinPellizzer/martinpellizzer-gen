It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia, and thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the genus Piletocarpus. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in construction and tool-making."
