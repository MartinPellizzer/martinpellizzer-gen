    "intro": "Plantago heterophylla, commonly known as the variable plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties. The species is adaptable and can thrive in a range of soil types, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
