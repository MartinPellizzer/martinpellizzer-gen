    "intro": "Papaver laestadianum, commonly known as the Laestadian poppy, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes many other poppy species known for their showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a distinctive, narrow capsule that contains its seeds. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
