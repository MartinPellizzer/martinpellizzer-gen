    "intro": "Polystichum lobatum var. aristatum, commonly known as the aristate wood fern, is a variant of the broadleaf wood fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, upward-pointing spore cases called sorus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with sterile and fertile pinnae arranged alternately along the rachis. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
