    "intro": "Psychotria fractinervata, commonly known as the \"Cocaine Plant\" or \"Yarei,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for containing alkaloids, including cocaine, in its leaves. Psychotria fractinervata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its psychoactive properties, it has significant ecological and cultural importance in the regions where it is native."
