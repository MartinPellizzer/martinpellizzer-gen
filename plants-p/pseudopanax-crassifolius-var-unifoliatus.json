    "intro": "Pseudopanax crassifolius var. unifoliatus, commonly known as the single-leaved punga, is a unique plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, simple leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant is part of the Araucariaceae family and is known for its ability to produce both male and female cones on the same individual. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
