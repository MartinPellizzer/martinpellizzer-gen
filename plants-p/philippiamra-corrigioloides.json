    "intro": "Philippiamra corrigioloides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
