    "intro": "Poa tenuicula, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often pale green leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Poa tenuicula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
