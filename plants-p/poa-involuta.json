    "intro": "Poa involuta, commonly known as the curly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, curling leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa involuta is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
