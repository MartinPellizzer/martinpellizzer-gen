    "intro": "Pleopeltis musifolia, commonly known as the musical fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded spore cases. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique appearance and graceful form make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The name \"musical\" likely refers to the sound it produces when wind passes through its fronds, creating a soft, rustling noise."
