    "intro": "Panicum ruscifolium, commonly known as curly top grass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often reddish in color. Panicum ruscifolium plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
