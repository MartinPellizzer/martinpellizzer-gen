    "intro": "Parnassia yui, commonly known as the Japanese ghost flower, is a rare and delicate member of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions in Japan. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Parnassia yui is noted for its limited geographic distribution and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
