It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with colorful, often purple or red blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pseuderanthemum maguirei is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded or semi-shaded gardens due to its compact size and vibrant floral display."
