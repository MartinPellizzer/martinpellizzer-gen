    "intro": "Polypodium fraxinifolium, commonly known as the ash-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It has a distinctive frond structure with long, narrow, ash-like leaves that are deeply lobed and serrated. The plant typically grows on tree trunks and branches, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients effectively. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year."
