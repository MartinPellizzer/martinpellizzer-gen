    "intro": "Plectranthus inflexus f. subglaber, commonly known as the smooth-leaved plectranthus, is a compact, trailing plant native to South Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the 'subglaber' form has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to violet flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or containers. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both gardens and indoor spaces."
