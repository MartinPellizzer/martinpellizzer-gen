    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum subsp. apurense, commonly known as the Caucasian four-leafed goosefoot, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by four-angled, hairy fruits. It is adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in areas with moderate moisture. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
