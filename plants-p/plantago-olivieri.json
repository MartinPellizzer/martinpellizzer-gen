    "intro": "Plantago olivieri, commonly known as the olive plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
