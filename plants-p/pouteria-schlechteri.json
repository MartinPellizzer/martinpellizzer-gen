    "intro": "Pouteria schlechteri, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy green leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in wet, nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit, known as the Brazil nut, is enclosed in a hard shell and contains multiple seeds that are commercially valuable. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various wildlife species."
