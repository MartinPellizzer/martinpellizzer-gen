    "intro": "Pavonia gerleniae, commonly known as the desert pavonia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. The botanical features of Pavonia gerleniae reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in drought-prone ecosystems."
