    "intro": "Polygonum tenue var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink to red, appearing in summer, and are followed by small, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges."
