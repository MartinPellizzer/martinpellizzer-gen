It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a red or purple calyx. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
