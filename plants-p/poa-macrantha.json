    "intro": "Poa macrantha, commonly known as the giant tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that are typically purple or pink in color. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. Poa macrantha is an important component of New Zealand's native vegetation and is adapted to cold, windy conditions."
