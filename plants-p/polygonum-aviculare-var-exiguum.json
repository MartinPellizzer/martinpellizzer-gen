    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. exiguum, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as lawns, gardens, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in various habitats."
