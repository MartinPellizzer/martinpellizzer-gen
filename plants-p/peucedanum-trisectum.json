    "intro": "Peucedanum trisectum, commonly known as the three-lobed cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often trifoliate or three-lobed. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, appearing in late spring to early summer. Peucedanum trisectum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
