    "intro": "Pteris ovata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lush, textured appearance. Pteris ovata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
