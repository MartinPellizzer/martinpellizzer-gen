    "intro": "Pittosporum virgatum var. crataegifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
