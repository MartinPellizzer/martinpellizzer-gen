    "intro": "Pilosella ambusta, commonly known as the slender hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and bright yellow ray florets that surround a central disk of tubular flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pilosella ambusta is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
