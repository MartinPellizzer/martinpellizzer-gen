It features glossy, dark green leaves with a reddish or coppery hue on the underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
