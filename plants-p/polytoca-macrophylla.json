    "intro": "Polytoca macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that allows it to float on the water's surface while anchoring itself in the substrate. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Polytoca macrophylla plays an important role in water ecosystems by offering shelter and oxygen to aquatic life."
