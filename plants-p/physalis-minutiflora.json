    "intro": "Physalis minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flower husk or winter cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries enclosed in a papery calyx. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands or disturbed soils. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers. The fruit, which ripens to a bright orange-red color, is edible and has a tangy, sweet flavor."
