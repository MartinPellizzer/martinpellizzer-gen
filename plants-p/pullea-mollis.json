    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pulla mollis, commonly known as the soft pulley or soft pullea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and emit a mild scent. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Pullea mollis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
