    "intro": "Psilotrichopsis cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and lack of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are closely integrated with its vegetative parts. It is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
