    "intro": "Portesia minor, commonly known as the lesser portesia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, producing a delicate, fragrant scent. Portesia minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
