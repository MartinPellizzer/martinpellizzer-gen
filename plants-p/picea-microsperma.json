    "intro": "Picea microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters and has a conical or irregular shape with dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are needle-like, short, and arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are small, woody, and often persist on the tree for several years. This species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in high-altitude environments."
