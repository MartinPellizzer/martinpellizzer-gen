    "intro": "Phegopteris axillaris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is well adapted to temperate climates and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
