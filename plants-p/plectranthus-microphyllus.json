    "intro": "Plectranthus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved plectranthus, is a herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white\u7ed2\u6bdb, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually a shade of purple or violet, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a versatile addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
