    "intro": "Phlomis cypria subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as western Cyprus phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. The plant features upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, serrated edge. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
