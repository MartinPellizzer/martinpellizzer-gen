    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. zelayense, commonly known as yellow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, feather-like inflorescences that produce small, yellowish to golden spikelets. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
