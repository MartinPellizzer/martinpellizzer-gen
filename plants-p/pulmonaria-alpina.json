    "intro": "Pulmonaria alpina, commonly known as the alpine lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of velvety, spotted leaves that are typically green with purple or reddish markings. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Pulmonaria alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
