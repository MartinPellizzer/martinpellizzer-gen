    "intro": "Prunus dolabriformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries that are similar to those of other cherry species. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a rounded form, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Prunus dolabriformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
