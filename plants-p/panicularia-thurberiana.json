    "intro": "Panicularia thurberiana, commonly known as Thurber's panicled grass, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and panicle-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in branching clusters, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects in its native range."
