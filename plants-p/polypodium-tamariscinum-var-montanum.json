    "intro": "Polypodium tamariscinum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its deeply divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
