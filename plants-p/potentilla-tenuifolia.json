    "intro": "Potentilla tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features include small, five-petaled flowers and a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age. Potentilla tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
