    "intro": "Polypodium temenimborense, commonly known as the Temenimbore fern, is a rare species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a unique rhizomatous growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
