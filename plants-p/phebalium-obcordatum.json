    "intro": "Phebalium obcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and open forests. Phebalium obcordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to native wildlife."
