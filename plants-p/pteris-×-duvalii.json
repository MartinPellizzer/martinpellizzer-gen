It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Pteris \u00d7 duvalii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
