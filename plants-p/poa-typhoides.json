    "intro": "Poa typhoides, commonly known as tussock bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms low-growing mats or tussocks, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden within the foliage. Poa typhoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
