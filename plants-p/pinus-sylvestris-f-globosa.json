    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. globosa, commonly known as the globe pine, is a variant of the Scots pine characterized by its dense, spherical crown. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in mountainous regions. The plant features short, stout needles and produces cones that are usually smaller than those of the typical Scots pine. Its compact form makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The botanical features of this form contribute to its adaptability to various soil types and climatic conditions."
