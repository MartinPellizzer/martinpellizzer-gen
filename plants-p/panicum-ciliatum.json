    "intro": "Panicum ciliatum, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, tufted shoots with fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in moist environments."
