It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth. Polystichum setosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
