    "intro": "Polyphragmon minus, commonly known as the lesser polyphragmon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
