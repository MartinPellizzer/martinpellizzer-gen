It belongs to the Oleaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like lilac and jasmine. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. It produces small, dark berries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
