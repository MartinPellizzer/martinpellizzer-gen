    "intro": "Populus simonii f. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a unique form of the Chinese poplar. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, making it an ideal choice for narrow spaces or as a privacy screen. The leaves are smaller and more elongated compared to the typical species, and they turn a striking golden yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting moderate drought tolerance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade in urban landscapes."
