    "intro": "Pachygone ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Ponap\u00e9 in the Federated States of Micronesia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Conservation efforts are crucial due to habitat loss and threats from invasive species."
