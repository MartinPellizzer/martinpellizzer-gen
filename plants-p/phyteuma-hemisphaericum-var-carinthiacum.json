    "intro": "Phyteuma hemisphaericum var. carinthiacum, commonly known as the Carinthian phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers, typically in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces small, rounded seed capsules that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
