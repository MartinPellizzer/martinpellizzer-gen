    "intro": "Palaua parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered palaua, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
