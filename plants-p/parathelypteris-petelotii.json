    "intro": "Parathelypteris petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered, lance-shaped leaves. The spores are released from small, kidney-shaped sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
