    "intro": "Podospadix harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's podospadix, is a rare and unique fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine,\u7ed2\u6bdb-like hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
