    "intro": "Polypodium ebenipes, commonly known as the ebony fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive dark green coloration that enhances its ornamental value."
