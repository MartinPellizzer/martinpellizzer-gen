    "intro": "Polypodium adnatum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique textured appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a serrated edge, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
