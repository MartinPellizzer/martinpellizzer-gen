    "intro": "Psilotrichum fallax, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, low-growing fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in acidic soils. Psilotrichum fallax is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
