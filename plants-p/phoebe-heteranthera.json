    "intro": "Phoebe heteranthera, commonly known as the Florida phoebe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with elliptical leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Phoebe heteranthera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
