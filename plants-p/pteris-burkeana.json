    "intro": "Pteris burkeana, commonly known as the Burke's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. Pteris burkeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
