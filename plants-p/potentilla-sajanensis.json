    "intro": "Potentilla sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Potentilla sajanensis is considered a rare and specialized species."
