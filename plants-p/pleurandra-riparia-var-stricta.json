    "intro": "Pleurandra riparia var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, rosette-like clusters. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, making it a valuable species for wetland restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil along water edges."
