    "intro": "Pleiocarpidia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu pleiocarpid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive morphology, including its woody structure and specialized floral arrangements. The plant exhibits a range of adaptations to its cool, moist mountain environment, such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors that attract specific pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat, Pleiocarpidia kinabaluensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
