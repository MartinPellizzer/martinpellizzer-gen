    "intro": "Pyrus rosiflora, commonly known as the roseleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and clusters of white, rose-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elongated, serrated, and have a distinctive reddish tinge when young. The fruit is a small, edible pear that ripens in late summer, though it is not as widely cultivated as other pear species. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
