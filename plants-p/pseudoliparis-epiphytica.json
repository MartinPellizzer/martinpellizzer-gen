    "intro": "Pseudoliparis epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic sea anemone, is a unique marine organism that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent tentacles and a central polyp that captures prey. This species is typically found attached to rocks or other substrates in intertidal zones. Its botanical features include a simple, branching structure with no true roots or leaves. Pseudoliparis epiphytica plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
