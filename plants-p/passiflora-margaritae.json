    "intro": "Passiflora margaritae, commonly known as the sea grapes or the white passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature a blend of purple, white, and blue hues, with a unique crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and often have a distinct scent. Passiflora margaritae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
