    "intro": "Polypodium polycephalum, commonly known as the horse\u2019s tail fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, clustered fronds that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds and release spores for propagation."
