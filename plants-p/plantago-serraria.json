    "intro": "Plantago serraria, commonly known as the narrowleaf plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces upright flowering stems topped with dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its adaptability and resilience make it a common weed in many temperate regions."
