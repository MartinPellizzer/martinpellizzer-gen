    "intro": "Phyllanthus polymorphus, commonly known as the variegated stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often variegated with white or yellow markings, adding to its ornamental value. Phyllanthus polymorphus is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate bright, indirect light."
