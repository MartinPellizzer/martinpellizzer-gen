    "intro": "Polygonum covillei, commonly known as Coville's knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wet meadows. Coville's knotweed is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
