    "intro": "Pinus troubezkoiana, commonly known as the Troubetskoy pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas. It is a tall, coniferous tree characterized by its long, slender needles and distinctive, drooping cones. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its harsh mountain environment, including a slow growth rate and thick, waxy cuticle on its leaves. It plays a crucial role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and threats from climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
