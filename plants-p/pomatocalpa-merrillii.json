    "intro": "Pomatocalpa merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with long, slender petals and a distinctive, intricate lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts its primary pollinators, such as certain species of bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
