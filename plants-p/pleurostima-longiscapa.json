    "intro": "Pleurostima longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed pleurostima, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and other succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Pleurostima longiscapa plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
