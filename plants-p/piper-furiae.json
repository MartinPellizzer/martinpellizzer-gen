    "intro": "Piper furiae, commonly known as the fury pepper, is a member of the Piperaceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing shrub that produces small, elongated berries that range in color from green to red when mature. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fruit contains a high concentration of capsaicinoids, giving it a strong spicy flavor. Due to its potency, it is rarely cultivated for commercial use but is of interest in botanical research."
