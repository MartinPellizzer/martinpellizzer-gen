    "intro": "Pandanus flagellaris, commonly known as the pandanus lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in a spadix, followed by the development of fruiting structures called \"pandanus fruits.\" Its leaves are fibrous and have been traditionally used for weaving baskets and mats. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangroves or in wetlands."
