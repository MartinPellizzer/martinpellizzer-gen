    "intro": "Passiflora trifoliata var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved passionflower, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature a blend of blue, purple, and white petals, along with prominent filaments and a crown of red filaments. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing a sweet, fleshy pulp. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a defining feature of the species. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
