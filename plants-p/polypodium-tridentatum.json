    "intro": "Polypodium tridentatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, wiry rhizomes that allow it to climb and attach to trees or other structures. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive trifoliate arrangement at the base of each pinna. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
