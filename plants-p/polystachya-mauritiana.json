    "intro": "Polystachya mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius sword fern, is a tropical fern native to Madagascar. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, arching fronds that are deeply divided into lanceolate segments. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the undersides of its fertile fronds, typical of the Polystachyaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor plant collections."
