    "intro": "Phacelurus speciosus var. afghanicus, commonly known as the Afghan bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Phacelurus speciosus."
