It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. This variant is distinguished by its pale, milky sap, which gives it its common name."
