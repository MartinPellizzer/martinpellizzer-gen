It features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance on the underside. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Pulmonaria oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to attract pollinators."
