    "intro": "Peperomia reflexa, commonly known as the zigzag peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often curled or folded, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden among the foliage. Peperomia reflexa thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to avoid root rot. Its unique leaf morphology and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
