    "intro": "Pneumonanthe parryi, commonly known as the Parry's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, white, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
