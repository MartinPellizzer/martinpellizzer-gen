    "intro": "Psychotria avia, commonly known as the \"Amazonian psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. It contains alkaloids, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which has led to its use in traditional medicine and spiritual practices. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research."
