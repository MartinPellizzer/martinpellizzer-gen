    "intro": "Polygala spinescens, commonly known as the spiny milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
