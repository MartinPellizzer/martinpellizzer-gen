    "intro": "Phyllanthus speciosus, commonly known as the ornamental spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many other spurge species known for their milky sap. Phyllanthus speciosus is often cultivated for its attractive foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright light for optimal growth."
