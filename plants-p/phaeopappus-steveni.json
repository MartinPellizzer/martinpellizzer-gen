    "intro": "Phaeopappus steveni, commonly known as the Steven's phaeopappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are small and yellow, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators."
