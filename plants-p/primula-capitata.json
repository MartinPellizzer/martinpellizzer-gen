    "intro": "Primula capitata, commonly known as the \"Snowy Mound\" or \"White Mountain,\" is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, upright stem with broad, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an attractive and hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine collections."
