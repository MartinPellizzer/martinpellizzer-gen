    "intro": "Polypodium scandens var. membranifolium, commonly known as the membranous fern, is a variant of the climbing polypody. It is characterized by its delicate, thin, and membranous fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it to climb and spread along trees or rocks. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a light green color and a feathery appearance."
