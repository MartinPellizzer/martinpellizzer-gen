    "intro": "Piper imperiale, commonly known as the imperial pepper or wild betel, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant, similar to betel leaves. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
