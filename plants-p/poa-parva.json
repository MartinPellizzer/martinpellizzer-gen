    "intro": "Poa parva, commonly known as the small bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of compact clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. Poa parva is characterized by its ability to thrive in compacted soils and its tolerance to frequent mowing. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
