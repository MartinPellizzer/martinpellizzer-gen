    "intro": "Platanthera herbiola var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called pseudobulbs, which aid in its survival in temperate climates. The species is noted for its ecological significance in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native regions."
