    "intro": "Parapteropyrum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well-suited to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its botanical features include a low-growing habit and a preference for full sun exposure. Parapteropyrum tibeticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystem and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
