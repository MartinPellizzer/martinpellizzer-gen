    "intro": "Plantago runcinata, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features erect, slender stems that bear alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stem, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, thriving in a variety of soil types. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss and provide some protection against herbivores."
