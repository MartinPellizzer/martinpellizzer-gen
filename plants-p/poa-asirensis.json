    "intro": "Poa asirensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa asirensis has small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
