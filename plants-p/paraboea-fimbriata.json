    "intro": "Paraboea fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed paraboea, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
