    "intro": "Prunus prostrata var. incana, commonly known as the silverleaf cherry, is a low-growing shrub native to China. It features small, oval leaves that are covered in a silvery-gray pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and compact growth habit."
