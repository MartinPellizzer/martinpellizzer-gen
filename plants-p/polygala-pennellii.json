    "intro": "Polygala pennellii, commonly known as the pink beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, bead-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Polygala pennellii is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
