    "intro": "Pachyphytum, commonly known as the stonecrop or moon cactus, is a genus of succulent plants native to the arid regions of Mexico. These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to survive in dry environments. They typically have a compact growth habit and often form rosettes, which help reduce water loss through evaporation. Pachyphytum species are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their vibrant colors and low maintenance requirements. They are also well-suited for rock gardens and container planting."
