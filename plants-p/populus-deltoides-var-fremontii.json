    "intro": "Populus deltoides var. fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, triangular leaves and distinctive, fluffy seed capsules that release seeds with feathery parachutes. The tree typically grows in riparian zones, along rivers and streams, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It has a rapid growth rate and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The bark is smooth and light gray when young, becoming fissured with age."
