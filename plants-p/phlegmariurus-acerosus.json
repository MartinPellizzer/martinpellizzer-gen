    "intro": "Phlegmariurus acerosus, commonly known as the hard-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear sporangia containing spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Phlegmariurus acerosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
