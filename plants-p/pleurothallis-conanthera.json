    "intro": "Pleurothallis conanthera, commonly known as the Conanthera orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
