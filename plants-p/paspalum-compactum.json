    "intro": "Paspalum compactum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in sandy or coastal soils, making it well-suited for erosion control in coastal areas. Paspalum compactum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
