    "intro": "Prasophyllum abblittiorum, commonly known as the Abbot's leek, is a species of orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is a terrestrial plant with a dense rosette of grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of white to pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, swampy environments and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It has a long flowering period, typically from late winter to early spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
