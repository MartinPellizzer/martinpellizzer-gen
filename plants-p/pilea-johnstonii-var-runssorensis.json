    "intro": "Pilea johnstonii var. runssorensis, commonly known as the Shrimp Plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of small, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy texture and a subtle reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by unique, shrimp-like seed pods. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental foliage and unique reproductive structures make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
