    "intro": "Potentilla anserina f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and arranged in clusters, blooming in early summer. The subspecies incisa is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Potentilla anserina."
