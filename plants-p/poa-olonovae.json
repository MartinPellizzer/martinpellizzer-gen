    "intro": "Poa olonovae, commonly known as the Olonovae bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, mat-forming structure that helps it withstand strong winds. Poa olonovae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
