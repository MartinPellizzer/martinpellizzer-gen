It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its rapid growth and shade-providing capabilities."
