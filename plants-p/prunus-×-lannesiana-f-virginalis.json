    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. virginalis, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus characterized by its striking white petals. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus serrulata, and is prized for its ornamental value. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with a compact form and dense foliage. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate and elegant appearance to gardens. The leaves are usually dark green and provide a nice contrast to the white blooms."
