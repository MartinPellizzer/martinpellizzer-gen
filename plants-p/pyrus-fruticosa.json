    "intro": "Pyrus fruticosa, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are typically yellow or red in color. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. Pyrus fruticosa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
