It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and possesses small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
