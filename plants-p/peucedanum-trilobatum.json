It is native to Central Asia and grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a ribbed, three-lobed fruit, which is typical of the genus. Peucedanum trilobatum is valued for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional medicine for digestive and anti-inflammatory purposes."
