    "intro": "Pseudojumellea florulenta, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. Pseudojumellea florulenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
