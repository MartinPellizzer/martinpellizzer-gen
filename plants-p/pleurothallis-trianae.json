    "intro": "Pleurothallis trianae, commonly known as the Trianas orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are usually clustered in small inflorescences, and the plant has slender, wiry stems with small, linear leaves. Pleurothallis trianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
