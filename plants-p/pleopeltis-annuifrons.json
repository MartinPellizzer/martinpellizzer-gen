    "intro": "Pleopeltis annuifrons, commonly known as the annual frond fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its fronds are usually covered with a fine, velvety coating. It produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. This fern thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining substrates."
