    "intro": "Pachycarpus terminans, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in summer. Its leaves are small and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Pachycarpus terminans is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
