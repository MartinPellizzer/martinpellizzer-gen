    "intro": "Polyscias schlechteri, commonly known as the broad-leafed sycamore, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with broad, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Polyscias schlechteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
