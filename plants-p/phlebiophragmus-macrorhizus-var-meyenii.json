    "intro": "Phlebiophragmus macrorhizus var. meyenii, commonly known as the giant root lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a thick, leathery thallus with a deep green to brown coloration, often featuring distinct lobes and a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capabilities, while the fungal component absorbs water and nutrients. It is typically found on decaying wood or stone in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a notable species in ecological studies."
