    "intro": "Polylepis pacensis, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in countries like Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. The tree is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Polylepis pacensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
