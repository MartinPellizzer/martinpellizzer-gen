It has fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often seen in late summer and early fall. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
