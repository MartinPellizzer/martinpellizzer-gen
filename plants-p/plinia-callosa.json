    "intro": "Plinia callosa, commonly known as the rough-hairied myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are covered in short, rough hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal forests and sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
