    "intro": "Panicum restingae, commonly known as the Restinga grass, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It thrives in sandy, nutrient-poor soils typical of the Restinga ecosystem. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal areas. Its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions makes it an important component of the local flora."
