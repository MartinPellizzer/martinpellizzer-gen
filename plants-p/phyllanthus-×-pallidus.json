    "intro": "Phyllanthus \u00d7 pallidus, commonly known as the pale phyllanthus, is a hybrid shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
