    "intro": "Puccinellia perlaxa, commonly known as sea oats, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for the seeds of true oats. The plant thrives in sandy, saline soils and is well adapted to coastal environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize dunes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its role as a pioneer species in coastal succession. Puccinellia perlaxa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to prevent erosion in beachfront areas."
