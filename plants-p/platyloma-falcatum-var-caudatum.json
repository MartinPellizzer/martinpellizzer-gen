    "intro": "Platyloma falcatum var. caudatum, commonly known as the cat-tail flatleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that resemble cat tails, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are adapted for wind pollination. This species thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats."
