It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, red, edible berries.

It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed."
