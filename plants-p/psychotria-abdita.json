    "intro": "Psychotria abdita, commonly known as the \"Screaming Cowplant,\" is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It has been studied for its potential medicinal properties, though its use remains largely in traditional practices. The plant's name is derived from the sound it is said to make when cut, though this characteristic is not widely documented."
