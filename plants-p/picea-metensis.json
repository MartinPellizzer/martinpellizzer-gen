    "intro": "Picea metensis, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, scaly bark and cone-like structures that contain edible seeds. The tree typically grows in high-elevation forests and is adapted to cold, dry climates. Its needles are short and bluish-green, and it produces both male and female cones on the same tree. Picea metensis plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
