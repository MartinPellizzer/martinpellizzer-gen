    "intro": "Puccinellia maritima var. major, commonly known as sea barley, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial species that typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils, adapting to saline and poorly drained environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its ecological importance is significant in salt-tolerant ecosystems along shorelines."
