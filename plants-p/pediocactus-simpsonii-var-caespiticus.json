    "intro": "Pediocactus simpsonii var. caespiticus, commonly known as Simpson's clustered cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southern United States. It forms dense, low-growing clusters of fleshy, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its natural habitat."
