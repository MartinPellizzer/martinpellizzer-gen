    "intro": "Pellionia, commonly known as silver velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. These plants are characterized by their soft, velvety foliage that often has a silvery or grayish hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Pellionia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, and they rely on insects for pollination. The genus includes around 100 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
