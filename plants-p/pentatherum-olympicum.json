    "intro": "Pentatherum olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic pentatherum, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its striking, spiraling arrangement of leaves that form a dense, rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited habitat and fragile ecosystem, Pentatherum olympicum is considered a conservation concern."
