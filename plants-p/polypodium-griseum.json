    "intro": "Polypodium griseum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its spores are produced in small, round structures called sorangia, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium griseum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
