    "intro": "Pteridium lineare, commonly known as the linear bracken, is a fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense colonies."
