    "intro": "Polypodium warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released when the spore cases mature."
