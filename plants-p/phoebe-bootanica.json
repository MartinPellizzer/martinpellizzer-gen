    "intro": "Phoebe bootanica, commonly known as the sacred forest plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. Its bark is thick and rough, often marked with distinct fissures, and it has a strong, earthy aroma. Phoebe bootanica is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties and is also used in ritualistic practices by indigenous communities."
