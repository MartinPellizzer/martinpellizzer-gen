It produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible drupes that are often used in cooking and traditional medicine. The fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a hard shell, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and economic importance. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various climates. The subspecies is closely related to other Prunus species, including the domesticated almond."
