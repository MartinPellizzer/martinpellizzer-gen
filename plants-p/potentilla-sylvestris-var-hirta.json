    "intro": "Potentilla sylvestris var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, often with a woolly texture. This variety is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodland or along streambanks."
