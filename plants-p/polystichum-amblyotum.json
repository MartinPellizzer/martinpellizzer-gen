    "intro": "Polystichum amblyotum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, narrow fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides, where it can form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered into sori. Polystichum amblyotum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
