    "intro": "Polypodium pteridioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
