    "intro": "Pyrus slavonica, commonly known as the Slavonic pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkans and parts of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for both its fruit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is less commonly grown commercially compared to other pear species."
