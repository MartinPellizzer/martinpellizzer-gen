    "intro": "Primula sikkimensis subsp. hopeana, commonly known as the Sikkim primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its mountainous habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
