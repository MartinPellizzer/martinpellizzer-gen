    "intro": "Piper undeninervium, commonly known as the slender pipevine, is a tropical climbing plant belonging to the family Piperaceae. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant has finely veined leaves that are often mistaken for those of other Piper species. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal in the wild."
