    "intro": "Polypodium caesium, commonly known as the rock fern or crevice fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions of the world, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that often grow in crevices or on rocky surfaces, adapting to shaded, moist environments. The plant's rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually divided into lance-shaped segments, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss. Polypodium caesium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in both indoor and outdoor settings with proper care."
