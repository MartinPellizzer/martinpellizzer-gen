    "intro": "Pilostyles blanchetii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are often mistaken for those of other species. Its roots attach to the host plant, forming a symbiotic relationship that is essential for its survival. Despite its lack of leaves and stems, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
