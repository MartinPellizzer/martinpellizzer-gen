    "intro": "Pilocarpus sulcatus, commonly known as the zigzag tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag branching pattern and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its hardy nature."
