    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 tschaunensis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has narrow, silvery-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
