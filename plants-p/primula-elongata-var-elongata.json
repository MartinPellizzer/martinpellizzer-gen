It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 30 cm in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and early blooming habit."
