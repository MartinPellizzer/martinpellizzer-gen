    "intro": "Pinus mughus f. applanata, commonly known as the flatleaf Himalayan pine, is a rare variant of the Himalayan blue pine. It is characterized by its flattened, scale-like leaves that distinguish it from typical pine foliage. This morphological feature is an adaptation to its high-altitude environment, reducing water loss in harsh conditions. The plant thrives in the alpine regions of the Himalayas, where it forms dense, wind-resistant stands. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
