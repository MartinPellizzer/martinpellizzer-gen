    "intro": "Potentilla supina var. discissa, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
