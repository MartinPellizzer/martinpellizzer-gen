    "intro": "Poa elegantula, commonly known as the elegant bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are usually held close to the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
