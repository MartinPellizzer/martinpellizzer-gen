    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variety is closely related to other Plantago species and is valued for its medicinal and ecological benefits."
