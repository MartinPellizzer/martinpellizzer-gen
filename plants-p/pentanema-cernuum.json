It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
