    "intro": "Papyrus aequalis, commonly known as the African papyrus, is a tall, reed-like plant native to the wetlands of sub-Saharan Africa. It has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, and is adapted to seasonal flooding. Its rhizomes are fibrous and have been historically used for papermaking and thatching. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters at the base of the plant."
