    "intro": "Pseudoprosopis sericea, commonly known as silverleaf mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has compound leaves with small, needle-like leaflets and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Pseudoprosopis sericea plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
