    "intro": "Piptochaetium stipoides var. chaetophorum, commonly known as the hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in open areas such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
