It features rounded, fleshy leaves with a distinctive broad, lobed shape, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
