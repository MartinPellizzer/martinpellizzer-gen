    "intro": "Pinelia leochilus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in nutrient-poor soils. Pinelia leochilus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
