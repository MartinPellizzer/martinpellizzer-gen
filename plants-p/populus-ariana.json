    "intro": "Populus ariana, commonly known as the Armenian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and pale, often developing fissures with age. Populus ariana is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in forests and along riverbanks."
