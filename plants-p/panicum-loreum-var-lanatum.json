    "intro": "Panicum loreum var. lanatum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, silky, silver-tomentose foliage. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to reddish-brown florets that are often tinged with purple. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in moist to wet soils, such as in marshes and swamps. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
