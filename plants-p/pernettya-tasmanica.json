    "intro": "Pernettya tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Tasmania. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cool temperate rainforests. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy surface and a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Pernettya tasmanica plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various native species."
