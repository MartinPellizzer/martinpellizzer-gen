It typically grows in moist, coastal environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This variety is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
