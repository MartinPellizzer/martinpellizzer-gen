    "intro": "Pyrus aria var. bullata, commonly known as the bullate pear, is a variant of the common pear species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy coating on the fruit, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps protect it from desiccation. The leaves are typically broad and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, is valued for its unique texture and flavor in local cuisines."
