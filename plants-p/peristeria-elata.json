    "intro": "Peristeria elata, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Peristeria elata is popular in horticulture for its dramatic nighttime blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
