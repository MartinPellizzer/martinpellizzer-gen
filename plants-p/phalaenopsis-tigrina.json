    "intro": "Phalaenopsis tigrina, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically come in shades of white, pink, and purple, with dark markings resembling a tiger's stripes. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical climate. Phalaenopsis tigrina is popular in horticulture for its long blooming period and ornamental value."
