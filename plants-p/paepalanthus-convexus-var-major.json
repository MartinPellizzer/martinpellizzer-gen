    "intro": "Paepalanthus convexus var. major, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a variant of the water hyacinth native to South America. It is a floating aquatic plant with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can form dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
