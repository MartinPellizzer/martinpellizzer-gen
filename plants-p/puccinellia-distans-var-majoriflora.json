    "intro": "Puccinellia distans var. majoriflora, commonly known as the large-flowered saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of coastal and inland dune ecosystems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
