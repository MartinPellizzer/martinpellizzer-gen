    "intro": "Pavetta luteola, commonly known as the yellow pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the warm season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, dispersing them through wind or animals. Pavetta luteola is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along streambanks."
