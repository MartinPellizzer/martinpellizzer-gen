It is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand, characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to maintain its health."
