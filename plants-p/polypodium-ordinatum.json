It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, evergreen leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium ordinatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
