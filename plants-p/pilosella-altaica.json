    "intro": "Pilosella altaica, commonly known as the altaic hairweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pilosella altaica is often found in meadows and on slopes, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
