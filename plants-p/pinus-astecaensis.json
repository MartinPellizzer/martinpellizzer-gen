    "intro": "Pinus astecaensis, commonly known as the Aztec pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. The tree has long, needle-like leaves and produces cones that release seeds in the fall. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
