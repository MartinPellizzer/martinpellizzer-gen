    "intro": "Phoradendron decrescens, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by berries that are typically red or yellow. Its leaves are alternate and usually elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Phoradendron decrescens plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, and its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat its berries."
