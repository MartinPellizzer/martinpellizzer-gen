    "intro": "Polygonum divaricatum f. scabridum, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a variant of the common knotweed species. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments. This plant is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a valuable ecological species and a potential weed."
