    "intro": "Pterostylis praecox var. robusta, commonly known as the robust spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in wet sclerophyll forests and rainforests, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy, greenish-white flower that has a distinctive spidery appearance. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thynnid wasps, which are attracted to the nectar-producing structures. The orchid is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in humid, cool climates."
