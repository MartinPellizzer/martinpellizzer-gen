    "intro": "Peteniodendron estoriense, commonly known as the Estoriense Tree, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid lowland forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic resinous bark. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern with a broad, spreading canopy and woody, fibrous roots that anchor it firmly in the rich, moist soil. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color, while its fruits are spherical and contain a single seed. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Peteniodendron estoriense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
