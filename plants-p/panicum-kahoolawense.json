    "intro": "Panicum kahoolawense, commonly known as Kahoolawe grass, is a native Hawaiian plant that thrives in coastal and dryland environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, bristly flowers. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and drought, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in limited areas on the island of Kahoolawe."
