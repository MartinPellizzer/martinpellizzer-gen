    "intro": "Pimpinella major f. rubella, commonly known as the red-stemmed cow-wheat, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature of the Apiaceae family. The f. rubella form is distinguished by its more vibrant red stem coloration compared to the typical form of Pimpinella major."
