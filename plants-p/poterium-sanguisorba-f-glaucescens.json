    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba f. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous dock, is a variant of the greater dock plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive bluish-gray underside. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers in late summer, which are followed by oval, spiky seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its astringent properties."
