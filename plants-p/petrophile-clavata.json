    "intro": "Petrophile clavata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lillypillly, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Petrophile clavata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native bees and birds."
