    "intro": "Periblepharis, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pink petals. The plants typically thrive in rocky or gravelly soils and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Periblepharis species are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and some species are cultivated for their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Periblepharis capensis and Periblepharis natalensis, which are adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
