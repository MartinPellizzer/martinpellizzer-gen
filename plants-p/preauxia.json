    "intro": "Preauxia, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. Preauxia species produce yellow or green flowers, followed by fruiting structures that contain seeds. These plants are adapted to harsh environments and play a role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
