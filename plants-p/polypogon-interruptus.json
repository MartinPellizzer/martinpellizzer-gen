    "intro": "Polypogon interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often interrupted by sterile nodes, giving it its scientific name. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Polypogon interruptus is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions and is considered a common species in its native range."
