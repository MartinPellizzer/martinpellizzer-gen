    "intro": "Psoralea annua, commonly known as the annual psoralea, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers in clusters. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Psoralea annua is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions."
