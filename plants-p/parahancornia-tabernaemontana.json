    "intro": "Parahancornia tabernaemontana, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in opposite pairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
