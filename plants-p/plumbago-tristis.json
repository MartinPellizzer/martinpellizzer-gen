    "intro": "Plumbago tristis, commonly known as blue plumbago, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
