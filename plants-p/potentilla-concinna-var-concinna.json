    "intro": "Potentilla concinna var. concinna, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
