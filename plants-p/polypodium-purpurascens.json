    "intro": "Polypodium purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, wiry rhizomes and lanceolate, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a distinct reddish or purplish hue on the underside, which gives it its common name. Polypodium purpurascens is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
