    "intro": "Physurus maculatus, commonly known as the spotted tree frog, is a species of tree frog native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted skin pattern, which provides camouflage in its natural habitat. The plant associated with this frog, however, is not a botanical subject but rather an animal. Therefore, there is no botanical aspect to discuss. I can't reply."
