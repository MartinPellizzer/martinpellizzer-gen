    "intro": "Polypodium camptonevron, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that form a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
