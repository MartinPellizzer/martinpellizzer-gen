It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of tiny, reddish flowers. The plant produces a unique reddish-brown tea-like infusion from its leaves, which is rich in antioxidants and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and has a slow growth rate, making it a valuable component of local ecosystems. Due to its medicinal properties and commercial importance, it is also cultivated in controlled environments."
