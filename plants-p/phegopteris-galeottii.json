    "intro": "Phegopteris galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, sunlit environments. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Phegopteris galeottii plays a role in water filtration and is an indicator species for clean, well-oxygenated water."
