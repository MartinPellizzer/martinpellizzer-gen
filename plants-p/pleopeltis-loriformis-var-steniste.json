    "intro": "Pleopeltis loriformis var. steniste, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
