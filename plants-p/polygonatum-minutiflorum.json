    "intro": "Polygonatum minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It features rhizomatous stems that grow close to the ground, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
