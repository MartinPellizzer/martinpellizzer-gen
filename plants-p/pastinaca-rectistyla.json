    "intro": "Pastinaca rectistyla, commonly known as the straight-styled parsley. It is a flowering plant in the carrot family, Apiaceae, characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It is native to Central Asia and thrives in temperate climates. Its root system is less developed compared to other parsley species, making it more of a foliage plant than a root vegetable."
