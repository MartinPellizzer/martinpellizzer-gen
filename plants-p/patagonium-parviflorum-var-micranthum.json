    "intro": "Patagonium parviflorum var. micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered Patagonian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid environments."
