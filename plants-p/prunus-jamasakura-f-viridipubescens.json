    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. viridipubescens, commonly known as the Japanese cherry tree with green pubescence, is a unique variant of the Prunus jamasakura species. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-gray pubescence on the young shoots, which sets it apart from the typical white or pink-hued varieties. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly serrated margin, and they turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of small, pale pink flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
