    "intro": "Poa paratunkensis, commonly known as the Paratunkensis bentgrass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like turf, often in moist or wet environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually short and compact, with a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa paratunkensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
