It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
