    "intro": "Pontia barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's cabbage. It is a species of flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family. Its leaves are usually glaucous, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Native to the Canary Islands, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate."
