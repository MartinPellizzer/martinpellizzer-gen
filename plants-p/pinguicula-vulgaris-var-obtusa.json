    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in early summer. The species is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
