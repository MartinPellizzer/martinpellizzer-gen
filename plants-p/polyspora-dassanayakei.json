    "intro": "Polyspora dassanayakei, commonly known as the Sri Lankan polypore, is a rare fungal species native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tough, and leathery cap. The fruiting bodies typically grow on dead wood, forming a bracket-like structure. Its spore-bearing surface is covered in tiny pores rather than gills, a feature common in polypores. This species is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
