    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. parviflora, commonly known as the sand potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
