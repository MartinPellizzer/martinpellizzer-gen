    "intro": "Poa palustris subsp. tanfiljewii, commonly known as the Tanfiljev's boggrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of marshes. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
