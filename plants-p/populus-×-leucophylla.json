    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 leucophylla, commonly known as the white poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a feature typical of many Populus species. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a bluish-white underside, contributing to its ornamental value. Populus \u00d7 leucophylla is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and open woodlands."
