    "intro": "Plantago brunnea, commonly known as the brown plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported soothing properties."
