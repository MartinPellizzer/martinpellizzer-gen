It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces erect flowering stems topped with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and along roadsides. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
