    "intro": "Phragmites dioicus, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and dense clusters of feathery, greenish-gray inflorescences. The plant is highly invasive in many regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly across wetlands. Phragmites dioicus plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
