    "intro": "Petrophile glauca, commonly known as the blue ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine white or blue waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.
