    "intro": "Psilotrichum sericeovillosum, commonly known as the silky flax or silky fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a soft, ethereal appearance. The plant belongs to the family Psilotaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the cool, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
