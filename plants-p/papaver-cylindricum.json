    "intro": "Papaver cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, pale pink to red, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branching stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its capsule-shaped seed pod matures into a cylindrical form, giving the plant its common name. Papaver cylindricum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
