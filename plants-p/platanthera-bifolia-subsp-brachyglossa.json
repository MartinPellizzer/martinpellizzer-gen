    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia subsp. brachyglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically arranged in two rows along the stem. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids."
