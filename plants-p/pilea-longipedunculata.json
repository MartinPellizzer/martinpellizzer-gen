    "intro": "Pilea longipedunculata, commonly known as the \"Chinese money plant,\" is a tropical houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, fruit-like structures resembling small, green balls. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea longipedunculata is relatively easy to care for and is often propagated through stem cuttings."
