    "intro": "Polgidon temulum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, silvery-green fronds that shimmer in the light, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, producing spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Polgidon temulum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
