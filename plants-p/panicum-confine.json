    "intro": "Panicum confine, commonly known as the narrow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, Panicum confine is valued in wetland restoration projects."
