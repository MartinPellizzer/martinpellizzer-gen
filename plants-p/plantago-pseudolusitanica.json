    "intro": "Plantago pseudolusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
