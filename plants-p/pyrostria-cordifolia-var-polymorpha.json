    "intro": "Pyrostria cordifolia var. polymorpha, commonly known as the variegated heartleaf cycad, is a rare and striking member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of the eastern Amazon basin in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base, which are often variegated with white or yellow markings. Its cycad-like structure includes a stout, unbranched stem and a crown of pinnate leaves. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native region."
