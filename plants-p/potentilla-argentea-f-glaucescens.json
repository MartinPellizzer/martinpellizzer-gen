    "intro": "Potentilla argentea f. glaucescens, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and long blooming period, which extends into late summer."
