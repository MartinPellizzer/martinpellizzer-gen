    "intro": "Paris polyphylla var. pseudothibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and southwestern China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution."
