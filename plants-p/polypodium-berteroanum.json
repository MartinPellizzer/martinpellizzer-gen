    "intro": "Polypodium berteroanum, commonly known as the Bertero's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Polypodium berteroanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
