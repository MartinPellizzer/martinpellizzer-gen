    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 ananassa, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a hybrid shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of leathery, oval-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The strawberry tree is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and air pollution."
