    "intro": "Plantago lanigera, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a rosette of broad, oval leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. The hairy plantain is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
