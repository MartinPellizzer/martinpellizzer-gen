    "intro": "Phoradendron commutatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the branches of suitable host trees. This parasitic relationship can significantly impact the health of the host tree over time."
