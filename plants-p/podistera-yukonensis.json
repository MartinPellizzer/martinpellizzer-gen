    "intro": "Podistera yukonensis, commonly known as the Yukon podistera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Yukon Territory in Canada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cold, short growing season of the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
