    "intro": "Paspalum appressum, commonly known as flat paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Paspalum appressum is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to form dense turf."
