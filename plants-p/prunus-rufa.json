    "intro": "Prunus rufa, commonly known as the red chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Prunus rufa thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open fields. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
