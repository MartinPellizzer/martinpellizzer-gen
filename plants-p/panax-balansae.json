    "intro": "Panax balansae, commonly known as the Balansae ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are valued for their potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically threatened in the wild."
