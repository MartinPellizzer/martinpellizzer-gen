    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are white and appear in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive fruits. This variety is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, contributing to local biodiversity."
