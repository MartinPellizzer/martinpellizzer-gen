    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 vallei, commonly known as the valley cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, arching stems. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Potentilla \u00d7 vallei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
