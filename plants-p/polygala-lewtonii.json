    "intro": "Polygala lewtonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, and it produces small, bean-like fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala lewtonii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
