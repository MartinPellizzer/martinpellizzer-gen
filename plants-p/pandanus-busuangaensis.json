The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which are borne on long, branching stalks. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in wet, coastal environments. The species is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
