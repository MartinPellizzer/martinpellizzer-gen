    "intro": "Pandanus drupaceus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, consisting of dense clusters of small, red flowers. These flowers are followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. Pandanus drupaceus is adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a resilient species in tropical climates."
