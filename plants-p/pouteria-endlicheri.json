    "intro": "Pouteria endlicheri, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody fruits. The fruit contains a single large, oily seed, which is the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system. It plays an important ecological role in the rainforest by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
