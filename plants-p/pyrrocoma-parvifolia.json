    "intro": "Pyrrocoma parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved pyrrocoma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its slender stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
