    "intro": "Populus schneideri var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and lanceolate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and limited soil nutrients. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
