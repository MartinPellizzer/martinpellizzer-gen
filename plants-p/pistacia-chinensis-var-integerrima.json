    "intro": "Pistacia chinensis var. integerrima, commonly known as the Chinese pistache, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with small, ovate leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its roots are deep and drought-tolerant. This plant is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
