    "intro": "Pilea morseana, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen or the velvet plant, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to Mexico. It features dense, dark green foliage with a velvety texture, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped or rounded. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are not particularly showy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea morseana is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
