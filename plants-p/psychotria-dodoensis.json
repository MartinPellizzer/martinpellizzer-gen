    "intro": "Psychotria dodoensis, commonly known as the Dodo's Psychotria, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
