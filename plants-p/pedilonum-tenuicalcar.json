    "intro": "Pedilonum tenuicalcar, commonly known as the slender-spurred orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread gradually over time. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
