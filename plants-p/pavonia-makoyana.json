It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, red or pink bract-like flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, often mistaken for true petals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Pavonia makoyana is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
