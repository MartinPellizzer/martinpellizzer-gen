    "intro": "Paphiopedilum coccineum, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red lip, which is often the most prominent feature of the flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, producing a fragrant, showy display that attracts pollinators."
