    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens subsp. alchimilloides, commonly known as alchimilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
