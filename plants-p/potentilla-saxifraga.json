    "intro": "Potentilla saxifraga, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, showy flowers that range in color from white to yellow and pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptic, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh alpine conditions. Potentilla saxifraga thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
