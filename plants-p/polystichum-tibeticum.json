    "intro": "Polystichum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
