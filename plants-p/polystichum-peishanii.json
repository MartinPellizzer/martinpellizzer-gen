    "intro": "Polystichum peishanii, commonly known as the Peishan holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often arching in growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polystichum peishanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
