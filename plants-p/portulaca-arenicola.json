    "intro": "Portulaca arenicola, commonly known as the sand purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and coastal regions. It has succulent, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand salt spray make it well-suited for sandy soils. Portulaca arenicola is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
