    "intro": "Panicum pseudopaspalus, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in erosion control and ornamental landscaping. Due to its low maintenance requirements, it is often found in natural habitats and cultivated gardens."
