    "intro": "Phaeonychium, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, contrasting with its vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Phaeonychium is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
