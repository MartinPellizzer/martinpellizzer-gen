    "intro": "Polystichum nayongense, commonly known as the Luzon ebony fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polystichum nayongense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
