    "intro": "Pellionia helferiana, commonly known as the silver velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Pellionia helferiana thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
