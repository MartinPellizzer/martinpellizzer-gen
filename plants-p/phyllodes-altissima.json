It is characterized by its long, narrow, and silky-hairy phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered spikes, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Phyllodes altissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
