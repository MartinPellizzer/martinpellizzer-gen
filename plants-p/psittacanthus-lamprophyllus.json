    "intro": "Psittacanthus lamprophyllus, commonly known as the golden-leaf hala. It is a species of cycad native to the Caribbean, characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance and its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy outer layer, and its leaves are large, pinnate, and often have a striking golden or variegated coloration. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by the development of hard, woody seed pods. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts aim to protect its natural habitat from degradation."
