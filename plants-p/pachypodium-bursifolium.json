    "intro": "Pachypodium bursifolium, commonly known as the Madagascar bottle tree, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has sparse, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stem during the dry season. Pachypodium bursifolium is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
