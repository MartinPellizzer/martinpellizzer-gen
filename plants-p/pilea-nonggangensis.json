    "intro": "Pilea nonggangensis, commonly known as the Nonggang pilea, is a rare and unique species native to China. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces delicate, spathaceous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
