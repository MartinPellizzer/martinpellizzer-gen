    "intro": "Poa attenuata subsp. actruensis, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
