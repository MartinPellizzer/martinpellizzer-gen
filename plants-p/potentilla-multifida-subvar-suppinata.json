It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
