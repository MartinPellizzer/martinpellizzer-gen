    "intro": "Pimpinella titanophila var. tomiophylla, commonly known as the giant cow parsley, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
