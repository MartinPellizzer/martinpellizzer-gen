    "intro": "Prunus communis coronata, commonly known as the crowned cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive crown shape, which gives it its common name, and its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both horticultural and ecological settings."
