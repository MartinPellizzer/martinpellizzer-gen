    "intro": "Polygonum thunbergii var. oreophilum, commonly known as the mountain smartweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its erect stem and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
