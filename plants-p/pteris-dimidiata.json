    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pteris dimimiata, commonly known as the split fern or the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that have a zigzag or undulating pattern, giving it its common name. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
