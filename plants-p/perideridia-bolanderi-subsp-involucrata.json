    "intro": "Perideridia bolanderi subsp. involucrata, commonly known as Bolander's pattypan, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by oval, ribbed fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and chaparral. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
