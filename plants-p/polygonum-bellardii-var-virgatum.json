It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
