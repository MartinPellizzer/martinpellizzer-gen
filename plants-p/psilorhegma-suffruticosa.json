    "intro": "Psilorhegma suffruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
