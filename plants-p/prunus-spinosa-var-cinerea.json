    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. cinerea, commonly known as the grey sloe, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically oval with a serrated edge and a bluish-gray underside, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is closely related to the common blackthorn, Prunus spinosa, but differs in its lighter coloration and slightly smaller fruit size."
