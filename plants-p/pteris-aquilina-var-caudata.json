    "intro": "Pteris aquilina var. caudata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
