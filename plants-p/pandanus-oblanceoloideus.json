    "intro": "Pandanus oblanceoloideus, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet, coastal environments. The species is often used in traditional crafts and as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
