    "intro": "Pleurothallis anaristella, commonly known as the Anaristella orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
