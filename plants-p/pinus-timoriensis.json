    "intro": "Pinus timoriensis, commonly known as the Timor pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the island of Timor in Indonesia. It is characterized by its straight, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited range and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
