    "intro": "Peperomia parvicaulis, commonly known as the small-leaved peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, upright rosettes of small, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the undersides. The plant produces compact, spicate inflorescences with tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
