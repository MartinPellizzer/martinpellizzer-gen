    "intro": "Pogogyne douglasii subsp. douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's pogogyne, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
