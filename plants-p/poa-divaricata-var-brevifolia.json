    "intro": "Poa divaricata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ability to form dense turf, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
