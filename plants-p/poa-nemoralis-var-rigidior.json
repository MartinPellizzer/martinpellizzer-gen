    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. rigidior, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing, tufted perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically stiff and upright. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat for small invertebrates."
