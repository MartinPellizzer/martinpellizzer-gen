It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
