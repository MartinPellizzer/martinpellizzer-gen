    "intro": "Pyrrosia brassii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth pattern and glossy, dark green fronds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
