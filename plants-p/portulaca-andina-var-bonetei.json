It is a low-growing, succulent plant with fleshy, thick leaves that help it retain water in its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant, bright orange or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
