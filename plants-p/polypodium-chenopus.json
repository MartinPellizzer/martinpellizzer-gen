    "intro": "Polypodium chenopus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a perennial plant that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polypodium chenopus is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
