    "intro": "Pentaschistis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone pentaschistis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to grow in calcium-rich soils, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
