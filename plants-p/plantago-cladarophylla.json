    "intro": "Plantago cladarophylla, commonly known as the cliff plantain, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal environments. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on tall, slender stalks. It is adapted to grow in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal cliffs and maritime regions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
