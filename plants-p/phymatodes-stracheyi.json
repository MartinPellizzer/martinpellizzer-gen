    "intro": "Phymatodes stracheyi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals in its habitat."
