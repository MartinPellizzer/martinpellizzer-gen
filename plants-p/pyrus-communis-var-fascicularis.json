    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. fascicularis, commonly known as the common pear with fasciated leaves, is a botanical variant of the European pear. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a distinct, ribbon-like pattern that sets it apart from typical pear varieties. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It produces small, edible fruits similar to the common pear, though they may have a slightly different flavor profile. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage."
