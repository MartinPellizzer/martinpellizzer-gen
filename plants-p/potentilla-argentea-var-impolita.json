    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. impolita, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and persistent winter interest."
