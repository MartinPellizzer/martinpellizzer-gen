    "intro": "Potentilla adscendens var. oligotricha, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are palmately divided with fine, hairy margins, and it produces small, woody fruits called achenes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils."
