    "intro": "Polygonum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it an effective pioneer species in disturbed soils."
