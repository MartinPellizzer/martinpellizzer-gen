    "intro": "Piper terminale, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a serrated margin. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible but often used as a spice. Piper terminale is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes."
