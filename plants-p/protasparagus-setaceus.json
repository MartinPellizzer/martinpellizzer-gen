    "intro": "Protasparagus setaceus, commonly known as the needle spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features small, spiny leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
