    "intro": "Pancratium foetidum, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a tall, erect stem with narrow, linear leaves and produces bulbous structures that store nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
