    "intro": "Polypodium cultratum var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and dark green, lanceolate fronds that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. The fronds are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae, with the terminal pinna often being the longest. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, and it prefers well-drained, acidic soils. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive colonies."
