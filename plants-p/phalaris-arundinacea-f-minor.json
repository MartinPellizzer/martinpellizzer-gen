    "intro": "Phalaris arundinacea f. minor, commonly known as the lesser reed canary grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical form. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, ditches, and along waterways. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
