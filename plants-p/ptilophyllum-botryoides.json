It belongs to the family Ptilophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant has small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on specialized stems and release spores for dispersal."
