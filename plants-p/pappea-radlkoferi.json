    "intro": "Pappea radlkoferi, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, woody trunk that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its hard, durable wood, it is valued for timber, although it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
