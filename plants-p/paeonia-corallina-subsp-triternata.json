    "intro": "Paeonia corallina subsp. triternata, commonly known as the coral peony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are typically hairy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
