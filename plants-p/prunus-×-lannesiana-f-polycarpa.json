    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. polycarpa, commonly known as the multi-fruited cherry, is a unique hybrid species within the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its ability to produce multiple fruiting clusters on a single branch, a trait that distinguishes it from most other cherry varieties. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin, and it produces small, white flowers in early spring. The fruit is a small, sweet cherry that ripens in late summer, making it a valuable ornamental and edible plant."
