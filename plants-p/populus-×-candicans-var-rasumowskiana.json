    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 candicans var. rasumowskiana, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its white to gray bark that exfoliates to reveal a lighter inner layer. The leaves are broadly ovate with serrated margins and a heart-shaped base. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
