It belongs to the genus Phormium and is characterized by its broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant produces striking violet or red flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Palala is adapted to coastal environments and thrives in well-drained soils.
