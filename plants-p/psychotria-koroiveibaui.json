    "intro": "Psychotria koroiveibaui, commonly known as the Koroiveibaui Psychotria, is a species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
