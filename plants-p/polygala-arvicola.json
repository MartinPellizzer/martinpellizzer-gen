    "intro": "Polygala arvicola, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display a range of colors, including pink, purple, and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Polygala arvicola is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
