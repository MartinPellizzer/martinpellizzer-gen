    "intro": "Peperomia vinasiana var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruit peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features upright, branching stems covered in glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly wavy in texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits that mature to a dark purple color. Its foliage is popular for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its resilience and aesthetic value."
