    "intro": "Pelargonium flabellifolium var. benguellense, commonly known as the Benguella geranium, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
