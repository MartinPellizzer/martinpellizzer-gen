    "intro": "Pinus pinaster var. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian maritime pine, is a variant of the maritime pine native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical variety. The cones of this species are woody and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters, containing edible seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and well-drained soils, exhibiting good resistance to salt spray and wind. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
