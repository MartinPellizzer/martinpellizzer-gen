    "intro": "Pyrus salviati, commonly known as the Salviati pear, is a small, deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The fruit is a pear-like berry that ripens in late summer, typically turning from green to yellow or red. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its edible fruits in some regions. However, it is less commonly grown today due to its limited fruit size and specific climate requirements."
