    "intro": "Polypodium fuscopilosum, commonly known as the black-scaled wall fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread along the substrate. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips."
