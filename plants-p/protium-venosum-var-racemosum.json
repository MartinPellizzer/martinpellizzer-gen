    "intro": "Protium venosum var. racemosum, commonly known as the racemosum variant of the genus Protium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with elliptical to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellowish-green in color, arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
