    "intro": "Poa costiniana, commonly known as the Costin's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Poa costiniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
