    "intro": "Patagonium muricatum var. incanum, commonly known as the white-furred mountain apple, is a variant of the mountain apple tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white-gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into edible, round fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its growth is typically found in high-altitude areas with cool, humid climates. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential culinary uses."
