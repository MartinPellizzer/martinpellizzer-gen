    "intro": "Procris repens, commonly known as the wandering jew, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Commelinaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that can spread across the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, and it is native to South America. Procris repens is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
