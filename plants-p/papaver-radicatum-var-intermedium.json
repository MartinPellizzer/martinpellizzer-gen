    "intro": "Papaver radicatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate poppy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a robust root system and lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variant is less commonly cultivated than other poppy species but is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in traditional medicine."
