    "intro": "Paspalum hallasanense, commonly known as the Hallasan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Jeju in South Korea. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of the local flora."
