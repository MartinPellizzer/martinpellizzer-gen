    "intro": "Piper toronotepuiense, commonly known as the Tepui Piper, is a rare shrub native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes numerous species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the highland ecosystems. Due to its restricted distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered an important component of the tepui biodiversity."
