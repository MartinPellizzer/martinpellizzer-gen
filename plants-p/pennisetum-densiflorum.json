    "intro": "Pennisetum densiflorum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, fluffy plumes of pale pink to white flowers in the summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both versatile and sometimes invasive. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide texture and movement in the garden."
