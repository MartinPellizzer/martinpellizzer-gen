It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its tubular, often red or purple flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in alpine flora."
