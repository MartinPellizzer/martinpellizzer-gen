    "intro": "Pandanus triangularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by edible, triangular fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its fibrous leaves are also utilized for thatching and basket weaving in traditional crafts. The species is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, saline conditions."
