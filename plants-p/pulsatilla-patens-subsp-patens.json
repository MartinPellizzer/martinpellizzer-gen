    "intro": "Pulsatilla patens subsp. patens, commonly known as the pasque flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in early spring. The plant produces a hairy, yellowish-brown capsule containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine, white down, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
