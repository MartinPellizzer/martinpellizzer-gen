    "intro": "Plantago azorica, commonly known as Azorean plantain, is a flowering plant native to the Azores. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
