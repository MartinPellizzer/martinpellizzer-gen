    "intro": "Polygala viridis, commonly known as green milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
