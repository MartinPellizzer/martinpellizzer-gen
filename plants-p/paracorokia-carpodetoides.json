    "intro": "Paracorokia carpodetoides, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, red berries that attract birds. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily rimu and kahikatea, through a specialized root system called haustoria. It derives some of its nutrients from the host but can also perform photosynthesis. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
