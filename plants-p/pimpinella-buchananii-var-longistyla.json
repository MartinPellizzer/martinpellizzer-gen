    "intro": "Pimpinella buchananii var. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled bishop's weed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white to greenish flowers. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, typical of the family, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the genus Pimpinella."
