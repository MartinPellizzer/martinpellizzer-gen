    "intro": "Pecteilis harroldii, commonly known as the Harrold's pecteilis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small white or yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
