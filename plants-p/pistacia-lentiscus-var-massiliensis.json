    "intro": "Pistacia lentiscus var. massiliensis, commonly known as the Massilian mastic tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Its fruit, which contains a resinous substance called mastic, has been used historically for medicinal and industrial purposes. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and high essential oil content compared to other Pistacia species."
