    "intro": "Phragmites altissimus, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It can grow up to 6 meters in height, forming dense stands that dominate marshes, lakeshores, and coastal areas. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and produces fluffy, feathery plumes that are distinctive in appearance. Its rhizomes spread extensively, allowing it to colonize large areas rapidly. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
