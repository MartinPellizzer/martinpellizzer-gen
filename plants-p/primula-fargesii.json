    "intro": "Primula fargesii, commonly known as the Yunnan primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
