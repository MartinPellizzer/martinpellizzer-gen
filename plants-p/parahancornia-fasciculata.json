    "intro": "Parahancornia fasciculata, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, forming a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Parahancornia fasciculata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
