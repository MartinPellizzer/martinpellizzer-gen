    "intro": "Primula nivalis var. longipes, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is a perennial species that blooms in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
