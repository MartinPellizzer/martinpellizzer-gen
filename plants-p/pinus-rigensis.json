    "intro": "Pinus rigensis, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a coniferous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five and have a bluish-green hue. The tree produces cone-shaped seed structures that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Pinus rigensis is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations."
