    "intro": "Phacelia leucophylla f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine phacelia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, often bluish-gray foliage and clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it an important species in alpine ecosystems. The frost-tolerant nature of this plant allows it to survive in harsh, cold environments."
