    "intro": "Potentilla agrimonioides var. intercedens, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
