    "intro": "Pachyphyllum tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Pachyphyllum tortuosum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
