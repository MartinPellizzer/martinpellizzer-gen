    "intro": "Pileostegia, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble butterfly wings, which are often more prominent than the actual small flowers. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Pileostegia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and alternate, palmately lobed leaves. The flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitats."
