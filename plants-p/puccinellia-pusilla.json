    "intro": "Puccinellia pusilla, commonly known as dwarf needlegrass, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and sandy areas, and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Puccinellia pusilla is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions."
