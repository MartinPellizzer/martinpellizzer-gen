    "intro": "Phaseolus adenanthus var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping runner bean, is a climbing legume native to South America. It produces attractive, heart-shaped leaves and bears showy, spurred flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground or along supports. Its pods are typically elongated and contain edible seeds, though the plant is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers."
