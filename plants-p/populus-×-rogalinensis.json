    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 rogalinensis, commonly known as the Siberian poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus alba and Populus tremula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically white-veined. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its natural propagation. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in various parts of the world for landscaping and ecological restoration."
