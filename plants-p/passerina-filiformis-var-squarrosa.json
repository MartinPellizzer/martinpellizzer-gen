    "intro": "Passerina filiformis var. squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers with prominent, spurred petals that bloom in early spring. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This variety is distinguished by its squarrose (spread-out) inflorescence and dense, woolly foliage."
