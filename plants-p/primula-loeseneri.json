    "intro": "Primula loeseneri, commonly known as the Loesener's primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
