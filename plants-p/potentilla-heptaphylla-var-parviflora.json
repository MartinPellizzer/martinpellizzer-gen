    "intro": "Potentilla heptaphylla var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features a compact growth habit with multiple stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a serrated edge, and the plant is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
