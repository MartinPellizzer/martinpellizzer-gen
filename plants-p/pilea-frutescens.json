    "intro": "Pilea frutescens, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features rounded, fleshy leaves that are often described as resembling small coins, which is the source of its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea frutescens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
