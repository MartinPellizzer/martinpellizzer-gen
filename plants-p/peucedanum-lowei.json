    "intro": "Peucedanum lowei, commonly known as the Chinese cowparley, is a herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its fruits are schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Peucedanum lowei is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
