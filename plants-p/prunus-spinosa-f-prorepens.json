It produces small, dark purple berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn red in the fall. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in temperate regions."
