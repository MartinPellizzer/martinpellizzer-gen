It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes resembling fingers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Polyscias digitata is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
