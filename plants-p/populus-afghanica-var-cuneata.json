    "intro": "Populus afghanica var. cuneata, commonly known as the Afghan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or reforestation efforts."
