It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically has finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small, red or black fruits known as achenes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be challenging to grow in colder climates."
