It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and serrated leaves that are adapted to salty environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. It has a low, sprawling growth habit and produces small, rounded seeds. Its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions makes it an important species for stabilizing dune ecosystems."
