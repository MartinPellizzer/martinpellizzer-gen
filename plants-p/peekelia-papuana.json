It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
