    "intro": "Polypodium weatherbyanum, commonly known as the Weatherby's sword fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients from the environment."
