    "intro": "Pisum decurrens, commonly known as the creeping or climbing pea, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing or sprawling along the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or white, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. Pisum decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological and agricultural contexts."
