    "intro": "Pieris mairei, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is an evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The leaves remain evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest in the landscape."
