    "intro": "Pedicularis daghestanica, commonly known as the Caucasian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain nutrients. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
