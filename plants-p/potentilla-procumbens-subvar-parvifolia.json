    "intro": "Potentilla procumbens subvar. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
