    "intro": "Pteris consobrina, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and marshes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. Pteris consobrina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
