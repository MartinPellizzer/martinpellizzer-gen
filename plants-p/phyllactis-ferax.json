    "intro": "Phyllactis ferax, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are often mistaken for the leaves of the true sumac species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by bright red, fuzzy fruits that persist into winter. Its bark is rough and furrowed, with a distinctive, horn-like appearance on older branches. Phyllactis ferax is often found in dry, open woods and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
