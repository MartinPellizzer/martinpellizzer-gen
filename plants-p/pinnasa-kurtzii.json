    "intro": "Pinnasa kurtzii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pinnasa kurtzii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
