    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals, and bloom in the morning. Portulaca pilosa is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
