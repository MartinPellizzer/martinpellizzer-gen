    "intro": "Palicourea riparia, commonly known as river beauty, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. Palicourea riparia is often found in moist, shaded areas along riverbanks and in dense tropical forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
