    "intro": "Plethiosphace, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of closely packed, rounded thalloid structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are often clustered and bear the male and female reproductive organs. Plethiosphace plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates."
