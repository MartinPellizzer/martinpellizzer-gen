    "intro": "Papaya aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange papaya, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Caricaceae family and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and striking yellow-orange fruits. The plant produces a fleshy, aromatic pulp that is rich in enzymes like papain, which is used in food processing and medicine. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it typically grows as a shrub or small tree. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, and it plays an important role in both local diets and commercial agriculture."
