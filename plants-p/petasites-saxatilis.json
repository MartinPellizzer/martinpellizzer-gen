    "intro": "Petasites saxatilis, commonly known as the rock edelweiss, is a rare and alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky and high-altitude environments, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific fungal species. Its leaves are large and heart-shaped, often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Petasites saxatilis is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
