    "intro": "Polypodium venustum var. niphoboloides, commonly known as the alpine polypody, is a fern native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It is a small, evergreen fern with delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to steep slopes, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh alpine conditions and its role in stabilizing mountain ecosystems."
