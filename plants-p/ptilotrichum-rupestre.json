    "intro": "Ptilotrichum rupestre, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic regions. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. Ptilotrichum rupestre is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
