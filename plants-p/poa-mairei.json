    "intro": "Poa mairei, commonly known as the Maire grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Poa mairei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
