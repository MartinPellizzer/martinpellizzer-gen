    "intro": "Phryne huetii, commonly known as the Huetii's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling ghostly shapes. Its growth is slow, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
