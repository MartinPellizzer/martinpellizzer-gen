It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow to brown florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
