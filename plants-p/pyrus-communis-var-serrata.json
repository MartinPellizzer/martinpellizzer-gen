This cultivar is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The leaves are typically dark green and have a rough texture, while the flowers are white and fragrant. The fruit is usually smaller than the common pear and has a slightly tart flavor. It is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
