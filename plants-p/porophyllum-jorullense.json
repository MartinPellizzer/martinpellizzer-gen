    "intro": "Porophyllum jorullense, commonly known as the Jorull\u00e9n silverleaf, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often found in rocky soils and is considered a resilient species in semi-desert ecosystems."
