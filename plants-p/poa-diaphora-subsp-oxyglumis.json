    "intro": "Poa diaphora subsp. oxyglumis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, grassy habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is often distinguished by its slightly longer glumes and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
