    "intro": "Phelypaea libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanon spleenwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial, non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive thalloid structure with a prostrate, leafy body that forms dense mats. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern and are often covered in a layer of rhizoids that help anchor it to the substrate. Phelypaea libanotica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
