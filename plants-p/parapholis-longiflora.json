    "intro": "Parapholis longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered parapholis, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it serves as a habitat and food source for various insects and small vertebrates."
