    "intro": "Penstemon anguineus, commonly known as the redstem penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Penstemon anguineus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
