    "intro": "Polystichum andinum, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to establish and persist in nutrient-poor soils. Polystichum andinum plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
