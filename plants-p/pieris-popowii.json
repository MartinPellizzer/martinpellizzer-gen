    "intro": "Pieris popowii, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its attractive, leathery, dark green leaves that are elliptic in shape and have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and seasonal floral display."
