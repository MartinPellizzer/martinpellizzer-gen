    "intro": "Pouzolzia suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, spiny fruits. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Pouzolzia suffruticosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides shelter for various desert animals."
