    "intro": "Pteroglossa jatataensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it in the substrate. The flowers, which can be white, pink, or yellow, bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
