These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. Parapiptadenia species are often shrubs or small trees, with some reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They are adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and flowers. The genus also includes species that are used in traditional medicine and for their nitrogen-fixing properties, which benefit soil fertility."
