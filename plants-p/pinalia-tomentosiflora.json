    "intro": "Pinalia tomentosiflora, commonly known as the woolly-flowered pinalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Pinalia tomentosiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
