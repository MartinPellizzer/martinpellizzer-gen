    "intro": "Panicum capillare var. hirticaule, commonly known as hairy hairgrass, is a variant of the hairgrass species native to various regions of the United States. It is a low-growing, perennial grass characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, fluffy inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its hairy texture is due to the presence of fine, soft hairs covering its stems and leaves. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
