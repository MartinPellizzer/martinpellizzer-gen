    "intro": "Pycnarrhena macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited pycnarrhena, is a rare and distinctive member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces large, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in cool, moist habitats such as montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
