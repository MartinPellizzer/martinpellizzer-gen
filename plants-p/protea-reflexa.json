    "intro": "Protea reflexa, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pale pink bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sugarbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Protea reflexa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
