    "intro": "Polygala volubilis, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and slender, twining stems that allow it to grow along supports. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in elongated inflorescences, which are often mistaken for seed pods due to their appearance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a hairy texture. Polygala volubilis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
