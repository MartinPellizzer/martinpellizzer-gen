    "intro": "Philodendron radiatum, commonly known as the radiatum philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Philodendron radiatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its rapid growth makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and vertical spaces."
