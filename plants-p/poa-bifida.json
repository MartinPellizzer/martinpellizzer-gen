    "intro": "Poa bifida, commonly known as the forked bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive two-lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Poa bifida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
