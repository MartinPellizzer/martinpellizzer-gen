    "intro": "Pseudoanastatica, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that can survive extreme desiccation, losing up to 95% of its water content and appearing dead. When exposed to moisture, it revives, turning green and resuming metabolic activity. This remarkable ability to survive drought conditions is due to its specialized cells that protect its DNA and cellular structures. The plant is often found in arid and rocky environments, where it thrives through its adaptive survival mechanisms."
