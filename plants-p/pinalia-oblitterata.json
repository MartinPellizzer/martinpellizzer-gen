    "intro": "Pinalia oblitterata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has no true leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Pinalia oblitterata is considered critically endangered."
