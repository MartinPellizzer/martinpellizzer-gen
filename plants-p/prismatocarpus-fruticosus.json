    "intro": "Prismatocarpus fruticosus, commonly known as the mangrove apple or mangrove pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy fruits that are often red or orange in color, which are adapted for dispersal by water. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
