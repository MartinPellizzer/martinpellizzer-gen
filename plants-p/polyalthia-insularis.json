    "intro": "Polyalthia insularis, commonly known as the island satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing smooth, dark seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
