The plant typically blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences at the tips of its stems. Pyxidaria caespitosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
