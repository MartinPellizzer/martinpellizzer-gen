    "intro": "Potentilla fragariastrum subsp. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, wiry stems and is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
