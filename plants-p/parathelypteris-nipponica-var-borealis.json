    "intro": "Parathelypteris nipponica var. borealis, commonly known as the northern rock fern, is a variant of the Japanese rock fern native to the northern regions of Japan and parts of Korea. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin and a dark green, leathery texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cool, moist conditions."
