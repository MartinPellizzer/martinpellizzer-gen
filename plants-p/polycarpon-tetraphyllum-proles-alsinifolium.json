    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum proles alsinifolium, commonly known as the four-leafed alsinifolium, is a rare and specialized plant species. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are arranged in a unique four-leaf pattern, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its flowering stems are usually short and bear clusters of tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and limited distribution."
