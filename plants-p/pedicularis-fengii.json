    "intro": "Pedicularis fengii, commonly known as the Chinese lousewort, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, and it is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. Due to its rarity and unique ecological role, Pedicularis fengii is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
