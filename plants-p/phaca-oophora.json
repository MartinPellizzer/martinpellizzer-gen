    "intro": "Phaca oophora, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which are often surrounded by spiny bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salty sea air and arid conditions. Phaca oophora plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
