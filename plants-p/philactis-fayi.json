    "intro": "Philactis fayi, commonly known as the fairy polypore, is a small, bracket-shaped fungus that grows on decaying wood. It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow pores instead of gills. The fruiting body is typically 2\u20135 cm in diameter and has a smooth, leathery surface. It is often found on hardwoods in temperate forests, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The species is notable for its association with specific tree hosts and its role in the decomposition of wood in forest ecosystems."
