It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in loose spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and drought tolerance."
