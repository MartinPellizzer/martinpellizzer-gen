    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 fenestratum, commonly known as the lace leaf geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed, and often fenestrated (fenestrated means having openings or holes) leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in summer. Native to South Africa, it is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and modest flowering. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a favored choice for gardens and containers."
