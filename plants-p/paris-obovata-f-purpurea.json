    "intro": "Paris obovata f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-leafed lady's tresses, is a striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, ovate leaves that often display a distinctive purple or reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces a tall, flowering stem with numerous small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
