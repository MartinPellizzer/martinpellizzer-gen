    "intro": "Polypodium propinquum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that grow in a rosette formation, often on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive serrated margin. Polypodium propinquum is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
