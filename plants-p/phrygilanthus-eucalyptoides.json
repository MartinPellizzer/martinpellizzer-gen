    "intro": "Phrygilanthus eucalyptoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed phrygilanthus, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
