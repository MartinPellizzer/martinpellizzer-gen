It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing dark brown, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Pongamia amoena is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
