    "intro": "Planchonella contermina, commonly known as the Kauri apple, is a tropical tree native to eastern Australia and parts of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits resembling apples. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fibrous pulp, which is edible but often described as having a mild, sweet taste. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities."
