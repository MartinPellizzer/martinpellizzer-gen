    "intro": "Psidium radicans, commonly known as the creeping guava, is a shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries similar to those of the common guava. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a mildly aromatic scent. Psidium radicans is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
