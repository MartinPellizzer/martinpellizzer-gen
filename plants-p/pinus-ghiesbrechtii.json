    "intro": "Pinus ghiesbrechtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbrecht's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the pine family. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Pinus ghiesbrechtii is considered a species of conservation concern."
