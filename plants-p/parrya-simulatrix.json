    "intro": "Parrya simulatrix, commonly known as the mimic parrya, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, contributing to its common name. Parrya simulatrix is relatively rare and is often found in meadows and open slopes at elevations above 6,000 feet."
