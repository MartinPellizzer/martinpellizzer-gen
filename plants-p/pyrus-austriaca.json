    "intro": "Pyrus austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian pear. It is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe, characterized by its rough, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental and fruit-bearing plant in temperate climates. Pyrus austriaca is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
