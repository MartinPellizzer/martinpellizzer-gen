    "intro": "Psittacanthus formosus, commonly known as the Taiwan cycad, is a species of cycad native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
