    "intro": "Pelea kaalae, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, round berries that are edible but have a mild, sweet flavor. Pelea kaalae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests on the islands of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
