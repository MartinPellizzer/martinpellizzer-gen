    "intro": "Polemonium himalayanum, commonly known as the Himalayan Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It features slender, ascending stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
