    "intro": "Peperomia ampla, commonly known as the broadleaf peperomia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a compact, evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 inches. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually borne in clusters and appear in late spring or early summer. Peperomia ampla is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light."
