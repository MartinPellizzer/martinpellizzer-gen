    "intro": "Pteroceras minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf coralroot, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and elusive species in its native range."
