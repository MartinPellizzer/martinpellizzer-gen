    "intro": "Palmorchis lobulata, commonly known as the spotted twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with two opposite, ovate leaves that are often spotted with dark green markings. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a raceme, resembling the structure of a twayblade orchid. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
