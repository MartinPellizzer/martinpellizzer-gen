It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Patrinia scabiosifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine."
