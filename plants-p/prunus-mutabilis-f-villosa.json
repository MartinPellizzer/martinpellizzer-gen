    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. villosa, commonly known as the velvet cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus characterized by its distinctive velvety, pubescent foliage. This variety is a hybrid between Prunus lusitanica and Prunus padus, exhibiting traits of both parent species. The leaves are typically a soft, gray-green color, covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which give the plant its characteristic appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries that ripen in late summer. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and unique foliage texture."
