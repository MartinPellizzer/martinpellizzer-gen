    "intro": "Pitcairnia atrorubens var. pallidobracteata, commonly known as the pale bract pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking, dark red bracts that contrast with its pale green leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
