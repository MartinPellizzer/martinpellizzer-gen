It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elliptical, red or purple berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates."
