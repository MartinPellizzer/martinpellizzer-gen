    "intro": "Pterocelastrus galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's boxthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
