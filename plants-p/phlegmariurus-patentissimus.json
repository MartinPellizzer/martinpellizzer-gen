    "intro": "Phlegmariurus patentissimus, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant forms dense mats and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobili, are clustered at the ends of the stems. Phlegmariurus patentissimus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
