    "intro": "Poa turgida, commonly known as the inflated grass or turgid bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of grasslands and disturbed sites. Poa turgida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
