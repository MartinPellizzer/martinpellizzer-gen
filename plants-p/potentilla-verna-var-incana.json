It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
