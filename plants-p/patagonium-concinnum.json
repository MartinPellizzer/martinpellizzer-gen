    "intro": "Patagonium concinnum, commonly known as the Patagonian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of southern South America. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Patagonium concinnum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
