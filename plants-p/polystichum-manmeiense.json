    "intro": "Polystichum manmeiense, commonly known as the Manmeiense shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum manmeiense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
