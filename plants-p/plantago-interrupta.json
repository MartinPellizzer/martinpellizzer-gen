    "intro": "Plantago interrupta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing qualities."
