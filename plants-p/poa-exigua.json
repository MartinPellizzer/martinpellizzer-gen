    "intro": "Poa exigua, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, erect culms that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three spikelets, each containing a single floret. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green hue. Poa exigua is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils."
