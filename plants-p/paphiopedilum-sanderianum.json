It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native climate. Paphiopedilum sanderianum is prized in horticulture for its beauty and rarity, making it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
