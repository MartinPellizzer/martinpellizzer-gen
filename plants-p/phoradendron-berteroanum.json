    "intro": "Phoradendron berteroanum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are often waxy and evergreen. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its growth is slow, and it can live for decades, forming dense clusters on its host. The plant plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
