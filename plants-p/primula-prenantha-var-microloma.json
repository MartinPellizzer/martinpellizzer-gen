    "intro": "Primula prenantha var. microloma, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal cushion, aiding in its survival in rocky or alpine environments. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
