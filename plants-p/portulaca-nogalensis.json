    "intro": "Portulaca nogalensis, commonly known as the Nogal prickly portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves and bright orange to red flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its thick stems and leaves help it retain water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
