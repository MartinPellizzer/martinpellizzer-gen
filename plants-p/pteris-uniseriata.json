    "intro": "Pteris uniseriata, commonly known as the single-row water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in damp forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris uniseriata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
