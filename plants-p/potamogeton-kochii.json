It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Potamogeton kochii is often found in slow-moving or still waters such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands."
