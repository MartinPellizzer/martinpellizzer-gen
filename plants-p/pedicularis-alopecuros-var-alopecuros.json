    "intro": "Pedicularis alopecuros var. alopecuros, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, thriving in rocky soils and open habitats. Its unique morphology and vivid coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
