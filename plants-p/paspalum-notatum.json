    "intro": "Paspalum notatum, commonly known as buffalograss, is a native grass species found across much of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal maintenance once established. Paspalum notatum is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
