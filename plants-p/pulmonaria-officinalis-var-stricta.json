    "intro": "Pulmonaria officinalis var. stricta, commonly known as the upright lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, in contrast to the more spreading form of the typical Pulmonaria officinalis. The plant features basal rosettes of velvety, spotted leaves that turn bronze in winter, and it produces tall, upright flowering stems bearing clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-purple flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
