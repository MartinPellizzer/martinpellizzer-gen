It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically features lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red or pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with conservation concerns. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity."
