    "intro": "Pleurothallis crepidophylla, commonly known as the cup-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, cup-shaped leaves that help retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding a subtle beauty to its natural environment. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
