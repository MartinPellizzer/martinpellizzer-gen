    "intro": "Phlox carolina var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Carolina phlox variant with heterophyllous leaves, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and features clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant's leaves are often variable in shape, with some leaves being narrow and others more broadly ovate, a trait known as heterophyllous variation. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for studying adaptive leaf morphology in response to environmental conditions."
