It is characterized by its striking, torch-like inflorescence composed of bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in warm, arid climates. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Pancratium arabicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
