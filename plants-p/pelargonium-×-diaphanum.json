    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 diaphanum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, slightly lobed leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pelargonium \u00d7 diaphanum is often used in hanging baskets and as a ground cover due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal."
