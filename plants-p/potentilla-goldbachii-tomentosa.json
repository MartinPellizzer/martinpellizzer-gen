    "intro": "Potentilla goldbachii tomentosa, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white pubescent foliage that gives it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in corymbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
