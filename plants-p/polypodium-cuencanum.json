    "intro": "Polypodium cuencanum, commonly known as the Cuencan fern, is a species of polypody that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is native to Central America and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium cuencanum is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, growing on rocks or in the understory of dense vegetation."
