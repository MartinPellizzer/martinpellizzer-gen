    "intro": "Potentilla hirta var. nicolitiela, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
