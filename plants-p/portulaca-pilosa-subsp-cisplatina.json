    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa subsp. cisplatina, commonly known as the coastal sandpalm, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its fleshy, hairy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland desert regions. Its ability to store water in its thick stems and leaves allows it to survive in arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and beauty."
