    "intro": "Pulsatilla alpina subsp. alba, commonly known as the alpine pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem with large, palmately divided leaves that are also hairy. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
