    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. sublatinasuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical white spruce. The plant exhibits a conical shape with a straight, tall trunk, often growing in high-altitude environments. Its foliage is typically a dark green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery, underside. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones."
