    "intro": "Poa tenellula, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Poa tenellula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
