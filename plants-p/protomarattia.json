    "intro": "Protomarattia, commonly known as the \"water fern,\" is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that often form a rosette shape on the water surface. They typically have finely divided fronds that help in photosynthesis while remaining afloat. Protomarattia species are found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Their reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to their ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
