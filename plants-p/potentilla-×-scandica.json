    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 scandica, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along the ground. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Potentilla \u00d7 scandica is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
