    "intro": "Pteris tenera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically 20 to 40 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a finely divided structure, giving it a lacy appearance. Pteris tenera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests."
