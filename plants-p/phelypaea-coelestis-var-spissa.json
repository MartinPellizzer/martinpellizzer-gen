    "intro": "Phelypaea coelestis var. spissa, commonly known as the sky fern, is a rare and striking variety of fern characterized by its elongated, arching fronds. The plant features delicate, pale blue-green leaves that give it a ethereal appearance, often resembling clouds or wisps in the air. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid tropical or subtropical regions. The fronds are typically pinnately divided, with a soft texture and a unique, almost otherworldly coloration. This variant is highly sought after by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique aesthetic."
