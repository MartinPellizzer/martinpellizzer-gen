    "intro": "Pouchetia, commonly known as the \"pouchetia tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth surface. Pouchetia species produce small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and they are often clustered in inflorescences. The wood of Pouchetia is valued for its durability and is used in local crafts and construction."
