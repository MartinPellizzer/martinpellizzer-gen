    "intro": "Pongamia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pongam, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing oily seeds. These seeds are rich in bioactive compounds and have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel. Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it an important species for reforestation and ecological restoration."
