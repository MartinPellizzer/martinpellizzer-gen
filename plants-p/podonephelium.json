    "intro": "Podonephelium, commonly known as the silver grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden within the leaf sheaths. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Podonephelium species are often used in ornamental gardening for their attractive, soft appearance."
