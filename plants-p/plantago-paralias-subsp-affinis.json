    "intro": "Plantago paralias subsp. affinis, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal environments and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
