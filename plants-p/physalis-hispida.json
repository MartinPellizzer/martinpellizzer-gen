    "intro": "Physalis hispida, commonly known as the rough huito or hairy lantern, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, spiny calyx that encloses the fruit, which is typically orange or red in color. The plant is native to Central and South America and thrives in warm, arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is edible when ripe and is often used in traditional cuisine and herbal remedies."
