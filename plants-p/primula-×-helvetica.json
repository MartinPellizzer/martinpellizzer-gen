    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 helvetica, commonly known as the Swiss primrose, is a hybrid plant originating from the cross between Primula vulgaris and Primula auricula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often cultivated in shaded garden beds or as a container plant. Botanically, it is a member of the Primulaceae family and exhibits genetic diversity due to its hybrid nature."
