    "intro": "Prunus helvetica, commonly known as the European bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, featuring slender, often thorny branches and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that turn from red to dark purple as they mature. Prunus helvetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine. It prefers well-drained soils and is relatively hardy, though it may be susceptible to certain pests and diseases."
