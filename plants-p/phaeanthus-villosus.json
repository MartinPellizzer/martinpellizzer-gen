    "intro": "Phaeanthus villosus, commonly known as the woolly phaeanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, or villose, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a faintly colored throat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. The botanical features of Phaeanthus villosus make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
