    "intro": "Pastinaca sativa subsp. opaca, commonly known as the black salsify, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, stout root that is typically black or dark purple in color, which is the primary edible part of the plant. The plant has lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritious root vegetable. This subspecies is less commonly grown than the standard pastinaca sativa but is valued for its unique flavor and historical use in cuisine."
