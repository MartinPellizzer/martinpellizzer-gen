    "intro": "Podochilus cornutus, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves and distinctive, horn-like structures on its flower spikes. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Podochilus cornutus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and private collections."
