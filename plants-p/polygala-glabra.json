It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are arranged in spike-like clusters, attracting various pollinators. Polygala glabra is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also studied for its potential ecological roles in its native environments."
