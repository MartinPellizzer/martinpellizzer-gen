    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 tschonoskii var. platyphylla, commonly known as the Japanese cherry plum, is a hybrid species within the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its attractive spring blossoms and compact growth habit. Native to China, it thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
