    "intro": "Physalis orizabae, commonly known as the Mexican groundcherry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its distinctive papery calyx that encases the small, yellow-orange fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow with five petals, and the fruit is edible when ripe, though it is often used in culinary applications. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its fruit and its aesthetic qualities."
