    "intro": "Pogonia macroglossa, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to eastern North America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands with rich, organic soil. The plant produces a dense, dark green stem with numerous small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose, spiraling pattern. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. The showy lady's tresses is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
