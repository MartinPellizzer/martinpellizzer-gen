It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant red foliage, which becomes more pronounced in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
