    "intro": "Paronychia lycica, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round, greenish-brown fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a succulent stem that helps store water. Paronychia lycica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
