It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are small, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
