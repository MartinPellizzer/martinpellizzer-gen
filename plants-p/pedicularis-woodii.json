    "intro": "Pedicularis woodii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, pinkish-red flowers that resemble orchids. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms in late summer. Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
