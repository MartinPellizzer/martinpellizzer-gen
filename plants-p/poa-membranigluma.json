    "intro": "Poa membranigluma, commonly known as the membranous grass, is a species of grass native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
