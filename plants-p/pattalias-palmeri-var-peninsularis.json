    "intro": "Pattalias palmeri var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the Baja California Peninsula. It is a small, slow-growing palm with a short trunk and a dense crown of feathery leaves. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing yellowish-white inflorescences that attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
