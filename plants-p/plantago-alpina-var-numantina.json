    "intro": "Plantago alpina var. numantina, commonly known as the Alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
