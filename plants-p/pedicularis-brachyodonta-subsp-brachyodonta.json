    "intro": "Pedicularis brachyodonta subsp. brachyodonta, commonly known as the short-stalked lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in rocky or alpine habitats and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It blooms in late summer, producing showy flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
