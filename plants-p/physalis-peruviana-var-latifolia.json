    "intro": "Physalis peruviana var. latifolia, commonly known as the Peruvian groundcherry, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that develop into orange-red, lantern-shaped fruits. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a tangy, sweet flavor. It thrives in warm climates and is relatively easy to grow in gardens. The fruit is encased in a papery husk, which dries and turns brown as it matures."
