    "intro": "Pterostylis chocolatina, commonly known as the chocolate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark brown, chocolate-colored pseudobulbs and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flower spike bearing a single, greenish-yellow orchid flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understoreys. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
