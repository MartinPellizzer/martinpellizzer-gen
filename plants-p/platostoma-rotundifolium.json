    "intro": "Platostoma rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. It reproduces via spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called sporangia. Platostoma rotundifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
