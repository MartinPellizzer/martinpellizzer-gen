    "intro": "Pleione praecox f. candida, commonly known as the white-flowered pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are often adorned with a distinctive white or cream-colored lip, which adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
