    "intro": "Pediocactus cloverae subsp. brackii, commonly known as the brackii cactus, is a rare and specialized species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular stem that often develops a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
