    "intro": "Pyrus seyboldiana, commonly known as the Seybold's pear, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy white flowers in spring. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are similar to pears but are often used more for ornamental purposes than for consumption. It has a compact, rounded form and is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy texture, adding to its visual interest throughout the growing season."
