    "intro": "Plantago ispaghul, commonly known as Indian plantain or psyllium, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by seed capsules containing fine, mucilaginous seeds. These seeds are widely used in traditional medicine and as a dietary fiber supplement due to their high mucilage content. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in soil stabilization."
