It is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The needles are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long and are arranged in clusters of five. The cones are woody and can reach lengths of up to 10 centimeters, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments."
