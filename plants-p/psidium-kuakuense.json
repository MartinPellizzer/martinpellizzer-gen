    "intro": "Psidium kuakuense, commonly known as the Guianese guava, is a tropical shrub native to South America, particularly found in Guyana and Suriname. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a yellowish-green color and is edible, though less commonly consumed than other guava species. The plant is often grown for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses in the regions where it is native."
