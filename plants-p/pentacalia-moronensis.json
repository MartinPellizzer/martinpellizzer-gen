It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in coastal or mountainous regions. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
