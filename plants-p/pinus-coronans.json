    "intro": "Pinus coronans, commonly known as the crown pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which gives it its common name. The leaves are needle-like, typically measuring between 2 to 4 centimeters in length, and are arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of Pinus coronans are relatively small, usually less than 5 centimeters long, and mature to a reddish-brown color. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a significant role in the ecosystems of its native habitat."
