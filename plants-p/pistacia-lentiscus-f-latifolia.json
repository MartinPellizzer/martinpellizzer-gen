    "intro": "Pistacia lentiscus f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mastic tree, is a variant of the mastic tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical mastic tree, which contributes to its distinct appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by greenish-black berries that mature in autumn. Its leaves are evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The tree is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used historically in various applications."
