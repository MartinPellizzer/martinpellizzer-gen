    "intro": "Platycerium sumbawense, commonly known as the Sumbawa staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the Indonesian island of Sumbawa. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the base of the plant, forming a rosette structure. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its fronds to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
