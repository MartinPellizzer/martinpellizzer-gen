    "intro": "Panicum braunii, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Panicum braunii is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
