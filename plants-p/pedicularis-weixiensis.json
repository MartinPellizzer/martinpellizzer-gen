    "intro": "Pedicularis weixiensis, commonly known as the Weixi monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vivid red or orange flowers, which resemble the face of a monkey, hence its common name. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
