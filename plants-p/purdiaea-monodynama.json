    "intro": "Purdiaea monodynama, commonly known as the single-seeded broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Ceanothus. The plant produces a single, elongated seed pod that contains a single, large seed. It blooms with small, yellowish flowers in the spring, and its life cycle is closely tied to its host's growth patterns. Due to its specialized nature, it is considered rare and is of interest to botanists studying parasitic relationships."
