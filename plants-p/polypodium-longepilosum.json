    "intro": "Polypodium longepilosum, commonly known as the long-hair shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky or shaded forest floors, thriving in humid, moist environments. Its rhizome is often covered in a thick layer of moss, which helps retain moisture. Polypodium longepilosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
