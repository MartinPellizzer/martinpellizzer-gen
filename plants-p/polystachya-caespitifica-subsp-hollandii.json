    "intro": "Polystachya caespitifica subsp. hollandii, commonly known as the African basket grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure compared to other members of the genus."
