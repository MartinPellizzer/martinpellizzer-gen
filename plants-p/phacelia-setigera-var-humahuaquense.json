    "intro": "Phacelia setigera var. humahuaquense, commonly known as the Humahuaquense bluebottle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, preferring full sun. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are arranged in dense clusters, making it a notable species for pollinators and a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
