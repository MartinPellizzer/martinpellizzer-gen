    "intro": "Psoralea castorea, commonly known as the Castor bean plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain toxic seeds, which are the source of castor oil. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is sometimes cultivated for its oil production."
