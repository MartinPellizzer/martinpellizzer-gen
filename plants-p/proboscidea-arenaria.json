    "intro": "Proboscidea arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often arranged in dense, rounded clusters. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Proboscidea arenaria plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops."
