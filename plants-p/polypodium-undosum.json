    "intro": "Polypodium undosum, commonly known as the wavy holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are divided into narrow, wavy segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern."
