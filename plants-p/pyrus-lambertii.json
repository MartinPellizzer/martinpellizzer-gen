    "intro": "Pyrus lambertii, commonly known as Lambert's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the fruit is a small, edible pear-like berry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus lambertii is considered a rare and endangered species."
