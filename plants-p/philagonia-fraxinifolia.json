    "intro": "Philagonia fraxinifolia, commonly known as the European ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it produces winged samaras as its fruit. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting biodiversity in forest ecosystems."
