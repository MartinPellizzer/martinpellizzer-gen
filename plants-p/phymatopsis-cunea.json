    "intro": "Phymatopsis cunea, commonly known as the narrowleaf phymatopsis, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and limestone areas. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Phymatopsis cunea is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
