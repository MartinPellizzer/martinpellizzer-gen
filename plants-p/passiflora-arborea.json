    "intro": "Passiflora arborea, commonly known as the giant passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a distinctive crown of filaments. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by wildlife and humans. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and can grow up to several meters in length. Passiflora arborea plays an important role in both ecological systems and traditional medicine."
