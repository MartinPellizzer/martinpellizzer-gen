    "intro": "Pachygenium comosum, commonly known as the woolly clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, club-shaped stem that is often covered in a dense layer of hair. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind. Pachygenium comosum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
