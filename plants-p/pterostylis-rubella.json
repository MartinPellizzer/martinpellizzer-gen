    "intro": "Pterostylis rubella, commonly known as the red-lipped hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hooded flower that resembles a small, fleshy pouch, which is a common feature among orchids in the subfamily Orchidoideae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys, where it can thrive in the cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a contrasting white or yellow lip, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The species is part of the genus Pterostylis, which includes over 100 species of orchids known for their specialized floral structures and ecological adaptations."
