    "intro": "Pyxidaria urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle shrub, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves contain irritant chemicals, similar to those found in common stinging nettle, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Pyxidaria urticifolia is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
