    "intro": "Phlomis major, commonly known as narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a velvety texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Phlomis major is often used in dry gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical medicinal uses."
