    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
