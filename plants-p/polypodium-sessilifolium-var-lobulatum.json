    "intro": "Polypodium sessilifolium var. lobulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf rock fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The leaves are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole, and have a distinctive lobed or toothed margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, rocky habitats."
