    "intro": "Podalyria styracifolia, commonly known as the sticky everlasting or sticky bluebell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, wiry stems that produce clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and a distinctive sticky residue on its stems and flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Podalyria styracifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
