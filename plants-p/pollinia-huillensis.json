    "intro": "Pollinia huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n pollinia, is a unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its specialized reproductive structures called pollinia, which are tightly clustered and adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its restricted habitat and specific ecological requirements, Pollinia huillensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
