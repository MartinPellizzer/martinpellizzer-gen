    "intro": "Primulina elegans, commonly known as the elegant primula, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen herbaceous plant with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with contrasting markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
