It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal leaves that are palmately lobed with three to five shallow teeth. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. Its stems are hairy, and the leaves are often covered with fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
