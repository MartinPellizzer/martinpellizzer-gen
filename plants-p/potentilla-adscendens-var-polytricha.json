    "intro": "Potentilla adscendens var. polytricha, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are typically divided into five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of alpine ecosystems and its potential use in traditional medicine."
