It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces large, woody fruits that contain up to 20 edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are commercially valuable. The plant has a complex root system that helps stabilize the soil in its native habitat."
