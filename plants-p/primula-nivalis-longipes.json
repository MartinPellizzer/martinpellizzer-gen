    "intro": "Primula nivalis longipes, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically basal, with a broad, rounded shape and a hairy surface that helps retain moisture. Primula nivalis longipes plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
