    "intro": "Panicum reticulatum, commonly known as the netleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, blade-like leaves that have a distinctive net-like venation pattern. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Panicum reticulatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
