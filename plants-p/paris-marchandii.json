    "intro": "Paris marchandii, commonly known as the western white trillium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its three white petals, three sepals, and three heart-shaped leaves, forming a symmetrical, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas and is often found in mountainous regions. It blooms in early spring, producing a single white flower with a greenish tint at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
