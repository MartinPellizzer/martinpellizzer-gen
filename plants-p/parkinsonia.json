    "intro": "Parkinsonia, commonly known as the screwbean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Parkinsonia aculeata, which is native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, pod-like fruits. They are often found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in hot, dry climates. Parkinsonia species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
