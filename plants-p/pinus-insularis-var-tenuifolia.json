    "intro": "Pinus insularis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf island pine, is a variant of the island pine native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more delicate compared to the standard variety. The plant is evergreen, with a conical shape and a dense crown, adapting well to the arid and rocky conditions of its native habitat. Its cones are small and often remain closed for a long time, releasing seeds in response to specific environmental cues. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in coastal and semi-arid environments."
