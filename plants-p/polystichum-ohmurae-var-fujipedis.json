    "intro": "Polystichum ohmurae var. fujipedis, commonly known as the Fujipedis holly fern, is a rare and distinctive variant of the ohmurae fern. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
