    "intro": "Plantago psyllium var. dubia, commonly known as the Indian chaff flower, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous seed heads that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
