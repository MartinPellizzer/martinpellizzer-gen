    "intro": "Phalaris subulata, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, greenish flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is drought-tolerant and can form dense mats, making it a useful plant for erosion control. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean and semi-arid ecosystems."
