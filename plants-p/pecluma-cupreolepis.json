    "intro": "Pecluma cupreolepis, commonly known as the copperleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its striking copper-colored leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, often surrounded by a fleshy, colorful cup-like structure called a cyathium. Pecluma cupreolepis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
