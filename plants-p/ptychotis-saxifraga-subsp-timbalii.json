    "intro": "Ptychotis saxifraga subsp. timbalii, commonly known as the Timbalai rockfoil, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, an adaptation to its arid and rocky habitat. The plant typically grows on limestone substrates, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences that bloom in the spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
