    "intro": "Phalaenopsis grandiflora, commonly known as the orchid with large flowers, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant flower spikes that bear numerous showy, long-lasting blooms. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Phalaenopsis grandiflora is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to bloom repeatedly over several years."
