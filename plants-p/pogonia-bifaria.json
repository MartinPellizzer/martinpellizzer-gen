    "intro": "Pogonia bifaria, commonly known as the twin-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and overcollection."
