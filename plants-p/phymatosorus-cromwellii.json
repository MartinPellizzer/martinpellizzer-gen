    "intro": "Phymatosorus cromwellii, commonly known as the Cromwell's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests with rich, organic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phymatosorus cromwellii plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
