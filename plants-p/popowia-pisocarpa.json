    "intro": "Popowia pisocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. Popowia pisocarpa is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in carving and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
