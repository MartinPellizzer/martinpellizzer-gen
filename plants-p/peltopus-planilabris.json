It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread efficiently and colonize new areas."
