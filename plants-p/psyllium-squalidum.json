    "intro": "Psyllium squalidum, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its strong odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
