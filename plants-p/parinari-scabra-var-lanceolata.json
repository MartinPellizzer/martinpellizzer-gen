    "intro": "Parinari scabra var. lanceolata, commonly known as the rough parinari, is a tropical tree species characterized by its distinctive rough, fissured bark. It typically grows in moist lowland forests and is native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. This plant is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
