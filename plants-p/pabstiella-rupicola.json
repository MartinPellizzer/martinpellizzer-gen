    "intro": "Pabstiella rupicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces such as stone or soil. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, and it lacks distinct lobes or rhizines. It is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. This lichen plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator of environmental conditions."
