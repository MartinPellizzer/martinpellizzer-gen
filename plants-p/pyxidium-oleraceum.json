    "intro": "Pyxidium oleraceum, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. The plant has thin, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Pyxidium oleraceum is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
