    "intro": "Phalaenopsis boulbetii, commonly known as the Boulbet's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom throughout the year. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for decorative purposes in homes and gardens."
