It features large, showy flowers with a distinctive marbled pattern on the petals and sepals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, warm environments. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are often pleated. This variety is popular in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
