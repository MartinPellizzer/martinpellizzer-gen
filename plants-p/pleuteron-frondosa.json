    "intro": "Pleuteron frondosa, commonly known as the leafy spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant's leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly serrated edge, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Pleuteron frondosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
