    "intro": "Polypodium camptophyllarium, commonly known as the bent-leaf polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often curve at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal."
