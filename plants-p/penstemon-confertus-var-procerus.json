    "intro": "Penstemon confertus var. procerus, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features upright, branching stems that can reach heights of up to 2 to 3 feet. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
