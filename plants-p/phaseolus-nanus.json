It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, making it well-suited for container gardening or as a ground cover. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate and slightly hairy. The flowers are usually yellow or white, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
