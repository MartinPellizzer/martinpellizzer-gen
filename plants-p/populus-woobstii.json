    "intro": "Populus woobstii, commonly known as the Tibetan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Populus woobstii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
