It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often reddish beneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Peumus mammosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates."
