    "intro": "Pseudobombax amapaense, commonly known as the Amapa rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Amazon rainforest of northern Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy pink flowers that bloom during the dry season. The tree has a straight trunk with a smooth, gray bark and produces woody capsules that contain numerous small seeds. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and local construction. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
