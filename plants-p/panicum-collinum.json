    "intro": "Panicum collinum, commonly known as hillside panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Panicum collinum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
