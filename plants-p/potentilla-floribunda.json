    "intro": "Potentilla floribunda, commonly known as the common potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features dense, upright stems covered in fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils."
