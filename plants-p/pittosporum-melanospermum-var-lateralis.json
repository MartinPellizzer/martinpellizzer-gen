    "intro": "Pittosporum melanospermum var. lateralis, commonly known as the coastal pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark, almost black seeds, which give it its species name *melanospermum*. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. It produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. This variety is typically found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
