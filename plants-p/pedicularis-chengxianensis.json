    "intro": "Pedicularis chengxianensis, commonly known as the Chengxian Beauty, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. This flowering plant is characterized by its vivid orange-red corolla, which is adorned with intricate patterns resembling a face, giving it its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
