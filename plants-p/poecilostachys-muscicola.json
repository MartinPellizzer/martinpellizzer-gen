    "intro": "Poecilostachys muscicola, commonly known as the musk grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive musky scent. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Due to its unique aroma and ornamental potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
