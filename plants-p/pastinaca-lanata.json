    "intro": "Pastinaca lanata, commonly known as the woolly burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tall, spiky flower stalks that bear small, purple flowers, which develop into burrs with hooked seeds. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open habitats."
