    "intro": "Ptychotis dichotoma, commonly known as the forked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal branches. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are small, scale-like structures that help reduce water resistance. Ptychotis dichotoma is a carnivorous plant, using specialized bladder-like structures to trap and digest small aquatic organisms."
