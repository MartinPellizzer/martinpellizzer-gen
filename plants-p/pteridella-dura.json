    "intro": "Pteridella dura, commonly known as the hard fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients effectively. Pteridella dura is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
