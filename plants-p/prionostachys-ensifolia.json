    "intro": "Prionostachys ensifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Prionostachys ensifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
