    "intro": "Primula caveana, commonly known as the cave primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Primula caveana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
