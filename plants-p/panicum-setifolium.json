It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of seed. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils or open areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
