    "intro": "Psidium grandiflorum, commonly known as the common guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. These flowers give way to edible, fleshy fruits that are typically pink to red in color and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. Psidium grandiflorum is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
