    "intro": "Pinus flexilis var. reflexa, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a variant of the flexible pine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of other pine species. The cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for an extended period, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique growth form and resilience make it a notable species in its native habitat."
