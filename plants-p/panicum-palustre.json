    "intro": "Panicum palustre, commonly known as marsh panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Panicum palustre plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
