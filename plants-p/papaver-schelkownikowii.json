    "intro": "Papaver schelkownikowii, commonly known as the Schelkunov's poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant is characterized by its vibrant, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
