    "intro": "Pleurothallis conformalis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
