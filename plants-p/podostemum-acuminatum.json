    "intro": "Podostemum acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows along the edges of slow-moving freshwater streams and rivers, with its roots embedded in rocky substrates. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often submerged, while its flowers are borne on short, erect stalks above the water surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they are pollinated by insects. Podostemum acuminatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
