    "intro": "Polypodium ampelideum, commonly known as the climbing polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and can extend along the substrate, allowing it to climb and spread efficiently."
