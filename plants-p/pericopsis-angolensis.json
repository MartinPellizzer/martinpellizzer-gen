    "intro": "Pericopsis angolensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The tree produces yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
