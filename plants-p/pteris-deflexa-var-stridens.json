    "intro": "Pteris deflexa var. stridens, commonly known as the curled water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that exhibit a distinctive curling pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The curled water fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
