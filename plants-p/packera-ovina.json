    "intro": "Packera ovina, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, open habitats like meadows and streambanks. Packera ovina is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
