    "intro": "Pachira lukayensis, commonly known as the Lukayensis money plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. However, it is important to note that it contains toxic sap, which can be harmful if ingested."
