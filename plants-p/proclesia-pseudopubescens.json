    "intro": "Proclesia pseudopubescens, commonly known as the hairy false spurge, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange to reddish seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
