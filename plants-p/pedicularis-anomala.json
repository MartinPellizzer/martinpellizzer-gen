    "intro": "Pedicularis anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the stems of other plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pedicularis anomala is considered a threatened species."
