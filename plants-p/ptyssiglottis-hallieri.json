    "intro": "Ptyssiglottis hallieri, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Ptyssiglottis hallieri has been historically used by M\u0101ori for its strong, fibrous leaves, which were used to make clothing and baskets."
