It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, characterized by its succulent stems and fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or sprawling, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Pseudocaryophyllus fulvescens is well-suited to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
