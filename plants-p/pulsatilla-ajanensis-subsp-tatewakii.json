    "intro": "Pulsatilla ajanensis subsp. tatewakii, commonly known as the Tatewakii Pasqueflower, is a rare and delicate member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces a single, hairy, and often spiny stem that bears the flowers at the top. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This subspecies is endemic to a specific region in Japan, where it thrives in alpine or subalpine meadows."
