    "intro": "Pitcairnia sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pink flowers. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand the dry conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Pitcairnia sphaerocephala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
