    "intro": "Piper corpulentispicum, commonly known as the fat-leaf pepper, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, fleshy fruits. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture. Despite its unusual appearance, it is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
