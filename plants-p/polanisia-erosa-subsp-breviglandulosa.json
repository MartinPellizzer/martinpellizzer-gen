    "intro": "Polanisia erosa subsp. breviglandulosa, commonly known as the slender-fruited polanisia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features opposite, lanceolate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, white to pale green flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and subtle floral display, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
