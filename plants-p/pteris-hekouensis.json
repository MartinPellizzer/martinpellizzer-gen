    "intro": "Pteris hekouensis, commonly known as the Hekou water fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
