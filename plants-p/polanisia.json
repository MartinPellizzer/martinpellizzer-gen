    "intro": "Polanisia, commonly known as the Polish lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plants typically grow in moist, woodland habitats and have strap-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Polanisia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their beauty. However, they are also noted for their toxic properties, making them potentially harmful if ingested."
