It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves that grow in dense, rosette-like clusters. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover.
