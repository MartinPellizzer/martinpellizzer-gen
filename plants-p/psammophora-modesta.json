    "intro": "Psammophora modesta, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its succulent leaves and deep root system, allowing it to store water and survive in sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Psammophora modesta plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
