The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
