    "intro": "Prosopis denudans, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that enable it to survive in drought conditions. Prosopis denudans is also valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock."
