    "intro": "Potentilla sabulosa, commonly known as sand cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Potentilla sabulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
