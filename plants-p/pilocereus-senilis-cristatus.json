    "intro": "Pilocereus senilis cristatus, commonly known as the Senile Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, and often ribbed stems that grow in a bushy, shrub-like form. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and collectors."
