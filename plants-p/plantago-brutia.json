    "intro": "Plantago brutia, commonly known as the Armenian plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The leaves and seeds of Plantago brutia have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
