    "intro": "Pinguicula longifolia var. reichenbachiana, commonly known as the Reichenbach's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, pitcher-like leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in late spring or early summer. The variety is distinguished by its elongated leaves and specific geographic distribution."
