    "intro": "Primula silaensis, commonly known as the Sila primrose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Western Himalayas. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
