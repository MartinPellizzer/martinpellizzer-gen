    "intro": "Pteris boultoni, commonly known as the Boulton's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris boultoni is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
