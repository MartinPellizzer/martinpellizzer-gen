    "intro": "Penstemon radicosus, commonly known as the Great Basin penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial species characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Penstemon radicosus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
