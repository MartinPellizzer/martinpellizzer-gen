    "intro": "Pharmacosycea parkeriana, commonly known as the Parker's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, ghost-like flowers that bloom in a pale greenish-white color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited research on its ecological requirements."
