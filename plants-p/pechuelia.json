These plants are native to Mexico and are characterized by their vibrant, bright orange to red flowers that resemble those of the common sunflower. Pechuelia species typically have narrow, lance-shaped leaves and are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens. They thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making them suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
