    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. vulgare, commonly known as timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-brown spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Timothy grass is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for forage and erosion control. It is also a common weed in agricultural fields and lawns."
