    "intro": "Pternandra borneaensis, commonly known as the Bornean pternandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, adapting to the low light conditions of the forest floor. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
