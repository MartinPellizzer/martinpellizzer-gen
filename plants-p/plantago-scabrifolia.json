    "intro": "Plantago scabrifolia, commonly known as rough-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, branched stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture on the upper surface. The leaves are typically covered in dense, stiff hairs, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. Small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes at the tips of the stems. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its hardy, adaptive nature."
