It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features needle-like leaves arranged in clusters, with a conical shape that becomes more pronounced as it matures. Its cones are typically small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
