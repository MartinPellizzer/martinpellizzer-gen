    "intro": "Pteris calcarata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris calcarata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
