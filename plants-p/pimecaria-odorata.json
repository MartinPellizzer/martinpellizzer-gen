    "intro": "Pimecaria odorata, commonly known as the silverleaf geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub, often reaching heights of up to 30 cm. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Pimecaria odorata is also valued for its fragrant leaves, which emit a subtle, mint-like aroma."
