    "intro": "Panicum constrictum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright red or bronze-colored inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and its stems are often reddish in color. Panicum constrictum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
