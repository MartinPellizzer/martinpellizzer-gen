    "intro": "Polypteris macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypteris macrolepis plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
