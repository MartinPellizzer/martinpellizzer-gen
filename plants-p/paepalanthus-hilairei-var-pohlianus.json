    "intro": "Paepalanthus hilairei var. pohlianus, commonly known as the Hilaire's pohlianus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiny stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
