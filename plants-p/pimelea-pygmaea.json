    "intro": "Pimelea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bottlebrush, is a small, shrub-like plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that resemble bottlebrushes. The plant typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers throughout the spring and summer. Pimelea pygmaea is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in native plantings."
