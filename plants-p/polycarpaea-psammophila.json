    "intro": "Polycarpaea psammophila, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its extensive root system. Polycarpaea psammophila plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
