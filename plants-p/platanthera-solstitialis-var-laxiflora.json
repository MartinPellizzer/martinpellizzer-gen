    "intro": "Platanthera solstitialis var. laxiflora, commonly known as the loose-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and bogs in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, around the summer solstice, hence its scientific name. It has a fibrous root system and possesses specialized structures called pseudobulbs for storing nutrients. This variety is less common than the typical form and is often found in acidic, moist environments."
