    "intro": "Parathelypteris chinensis var. hirticarpa, commonly known as the hairy-veined water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
