    "intro": "Piper purulentum, commonly known as the smelly pepper or stinking pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the Amazon rainforest and is characterized by its aromatic, often pungent leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It is often found growing in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique scent and habitat, it is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
