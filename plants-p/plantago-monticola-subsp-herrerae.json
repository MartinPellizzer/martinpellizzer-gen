    "intro": "Plantago monticola subsp. herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of mountainous flora."
