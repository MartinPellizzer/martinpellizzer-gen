    "intro": "Prunus velutina, commonly known as the velvet cherry, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a sour taste. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a velvety texture on the underside. Prunus velutina is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
