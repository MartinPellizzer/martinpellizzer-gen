    "intro": "Paronychia australis, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are succulent and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Paronychia australis is also known for its ability to thrive in salt spray and is often found in dune ecosystems."
