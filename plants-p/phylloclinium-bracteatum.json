    "intro": "Phylloclinium bracteatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
