    "intro": "Polysphaeria neriifolia, commonly known as the blackberry fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that resemble the leaves of blackberries, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polysphaeria neriifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
