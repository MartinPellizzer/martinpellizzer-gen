    "intro": "Platanthera sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and long, spiraling inflorescences that bear fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. It is adapted to high altitudes and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
