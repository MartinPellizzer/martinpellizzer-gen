    "intro": "Pogostemon falcatus, commonly known as the sickle grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it adaptable to various moist environments. Pogostemon falcatus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
