    "intro": "Piper nervosum, commonly known as the sensitive pepper or velvetleaf, is a tropical vine native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into small, dark blue to black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
