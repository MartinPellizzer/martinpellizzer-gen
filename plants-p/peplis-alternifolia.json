It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
