    "intro": "Plectaneia firingalavensis var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate plectaneia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Firingalava Mountains. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color, which bloom during the brief summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or on slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
