    "intro": "Primula albenensis, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It belongs to the Primulaceae family, which includes other flowering plants known for their showy blooms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
