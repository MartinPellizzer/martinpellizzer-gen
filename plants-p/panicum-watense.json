    "intro": "Panicum watense, commonly known as the Watens grass, is a species of grass native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and parallel veins. Panicum watense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
