    "intro": "Pyrus sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka hawthorn, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riparian habitats. Pyrus sitchensis is valued for its hardiness and ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
