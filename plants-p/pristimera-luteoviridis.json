    "intro": "Pristimera luteoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-green staghorn fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a central, tree-like structure called a rhizome, which supports the fronds. Its leaves are typically bright green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Pristimera luteoviridis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
