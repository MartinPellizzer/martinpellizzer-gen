    "intro": "Pteris capensis, commonly known as the Cape fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pteris capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
