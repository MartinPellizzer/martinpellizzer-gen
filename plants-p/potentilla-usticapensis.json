    "intro": "Potentilla usticapensis, commonly known as the rocky potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh, arid environments. Potentilla usticapensis is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
