    "intro": "Pronephrium affine, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. Pronephrium affine is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through the digestion of small aquatic organisms."
