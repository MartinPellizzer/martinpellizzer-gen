    "intro": "Passiflora cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco passionflower, is a striking climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding a central cluster of stamens. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and have been traditionally used in local cuisines. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and can reach significant lengths. This species is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
