It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, white plumes that appear at the top of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable landscape plant and a potential weed in some areas."
