    "intro": "Pinus porphyrocarpa, commonly known as the red bark pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark, which becomes more intensely colored with age. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five, and it produces cones that are often reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
