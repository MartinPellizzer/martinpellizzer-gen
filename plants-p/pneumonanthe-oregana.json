    "intro": "Pneumonanthe oregana, commonly known as Oregon lungwort, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive pattern of white, pink, and purple spots. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is named for its resemblance to lung tissue, a feature that has contributed to its historical use in traditional medicine."
