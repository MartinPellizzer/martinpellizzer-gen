    "intro": "Pinus balsamea, commonly known as the balsam fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming thicker and more furrowed with age. The balsam fir is often found in boreal forests and is adapted to cold climates and acidic soils."
