    "intro": "Platyopuntia nigrispina, commonly known as the black-spined flat cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with short, cylindrical stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are dark brown to black, giving it its common name, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
