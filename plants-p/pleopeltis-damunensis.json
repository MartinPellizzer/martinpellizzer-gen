    "intro": "Pleopeltis damunensis, commonly known as the Damun rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has a rhizome that is short and thick, with aerial roots that help it anchor to its host. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pleopeltis damunensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
