    "intro": "Phoebe longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled phoebe, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated petioles, which are the stalks connecting the leaves to the stem. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth, waxy surface. Phoebe longepetiolata produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, dark berries that are an important food source for local wildlife."
