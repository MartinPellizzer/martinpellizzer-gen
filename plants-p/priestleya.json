    "intro": "Priestleya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Priestleya has a delicate, fibrous root system that helps it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
