    "intro": "Phacelia leucophylla, commonly known as white-leaf phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has hairy leaves and a sprawling growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Phacelia leucophylla is also valued as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
