    "intro": "Primula petraea, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky soils. Its leaves are typically basal, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of down. Primula petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
