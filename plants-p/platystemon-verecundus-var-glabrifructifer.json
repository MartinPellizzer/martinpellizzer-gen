    "intro": "Platystemon verecundus var. glabrifructifer, commonly known as the smooth-fruited platystemon, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its fruit is a distinctive, smooth, oval capsule that matures to a deep red color, containing several small, hard seeds. Due to its limited geographic range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
