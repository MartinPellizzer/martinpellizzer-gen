The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting wildlife."
