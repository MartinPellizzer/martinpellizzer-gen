    "intro": "Psilocarya velutina, commonly known as the velvet psilocybe, is a species of hallucinogenic mushroom native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Psilocybe genus and is characterized by its dense, velvety cap that is typically brown or olive in color. The fruiting bodies often grow in grassy areas and are closely related to other psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The spores are produced in a distinctive, sac-like structure called a volva, which is a key identifying feature. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is often sought after for its effects but requires careful handling and legal considerations."
