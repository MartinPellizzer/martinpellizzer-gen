    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora f. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled potentilla, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, upright stems with dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and elliptic, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is noted for its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form of Potentilla grandiflora. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
