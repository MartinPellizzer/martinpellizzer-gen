    "intro": "Phegopteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are covered in small, rounded lobes."
