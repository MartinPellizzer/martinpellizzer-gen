It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short, erect stem and clustered, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Phlegmariurus funiformis is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of certain ecosystems."
