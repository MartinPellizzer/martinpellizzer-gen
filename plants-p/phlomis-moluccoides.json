It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly woolly texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to dry conditions. Phlomis moluccoides is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens."
