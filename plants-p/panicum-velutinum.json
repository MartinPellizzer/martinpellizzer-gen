    "intro": "Panicum velutinum, commonly known as velvet bluestem, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fine, silky hairs that give it a velvety appearance. This plant typically grows in prairie and woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms with small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are often visible in the late summer and early fall. Velvet bluestem is an important component of native grasslands and provides forage for wildlife."
