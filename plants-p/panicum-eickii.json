    "intro": "Panicum eickii, commonly known as the Eickii grass, is a perennial warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and landscapes. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest. Panicum eickii is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract wildlife."
