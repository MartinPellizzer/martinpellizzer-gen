    "intro": "Psilotrichum scleranthum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its flowering period typically occurs in spring and early summer. Psilotrichum scleranthum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
