    "intro": "Psammostachys varia, commonly known as the variable sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Psammostachys varia is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
