    "intro": "Pimpinella pseudotragium, commonly known as the false hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant has a hollow, ridged stem and produces small, white to greenish flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
