    "intro": "Pedilonum undatialatum, commonly known as the silver-leafed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique leaf structure, with a waxy coating, helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
