    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium rhodarum, commonly known as the redstem goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pseudognaphalium rhodarum is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
