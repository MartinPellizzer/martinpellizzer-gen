    "intro": "Plantago bellardii var. leptocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
