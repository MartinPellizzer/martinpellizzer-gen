    "intro": "Pectis humifusa, commonly known as the flatleaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and usually lie close to the ground, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Pectis humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
