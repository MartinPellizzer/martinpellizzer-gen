    "intro": "Poa maysorensis, commonly known as the Sikkim bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest margins. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. Poa maysorensis plays a minor ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for local wildlife."
