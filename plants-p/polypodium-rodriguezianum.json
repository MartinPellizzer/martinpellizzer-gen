    "intro": "Polypodium rodriguezianum, commonly known as the Rodriguez's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
