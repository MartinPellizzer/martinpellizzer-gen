    "intro": "Piresodendron, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Piresodendron sambianum, which is native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their smooth, often aromatic bark and their ornamental, palm-like appearance. They typically grow as trees or shrubs, with large, pinnately compound leaves. Piresodendron species are valued for their durable wood and are sometimes cultivated for their aesthetic appeal in gardens."
