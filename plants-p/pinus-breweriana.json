    "intro": "Pinus breweriana, commonly known as Brewer's pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada in California. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and cones that hang downward. The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to harsh, cold, and dry conditions. Its cones are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long and release seeds in the spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
