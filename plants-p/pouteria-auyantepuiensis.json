    "intro": "Pouteria auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the \"Yanapai\" or \"Pachira,\" is a species native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in regions of Venezuela and Brazil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, buttressed trunk and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are rich in nutrients. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for local wildlife and its potential for use in traditional medicine."
