    "intro": "Pilea riopalenquensis, commonly known as the R\u00edo Palenqu\u00e9n pilea, is a rare and compact houseplant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight reddish tinge on the undersides. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a sought-after specimen among plant enthusiasts."
