    "intro": "Polypodium scolopendria, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic and terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, elongated fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizome that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium scolopendria thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or in rocky crevices."
