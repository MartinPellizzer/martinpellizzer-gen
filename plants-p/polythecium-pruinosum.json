    "intro": "Polythecium pruinosum, commonly known as the sticky polypore, is a small, bracket-shaped fungus that typically grows on dead wood. It has a smooth, pale to reddish-brown cap with a sticky surface that gives it its common name. The fruiting body is usually 1\u20133 cm in diameter and has a spongy texture. It is found in temperate regions and is often associated with coniferous trees. This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing wood and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
