    "intro": "Pseudobaccharis ligustrina, commonly known as bluebunch muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking blue-gray foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the summer months. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in panicles and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
