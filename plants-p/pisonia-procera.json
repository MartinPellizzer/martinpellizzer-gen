    "intro": "Pisonia procera, commonly known as the tropical hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and a long, narrow tube, and they bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pisonia procera thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests."
