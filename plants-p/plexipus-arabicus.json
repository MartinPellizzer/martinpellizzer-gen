    "intro": "Plexipus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Due to its resilience, it is often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas."
