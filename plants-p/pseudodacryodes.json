    "intro": "Pseudodacryodes, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. These plants are native to tropical Africa and are characterized by their aromatic, often fragrant leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruits are typically drupes, containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Pseudodacryodes species are often found in lowland rainforests and are valued for their timber, which is used in furniture and construction. The genus includes several species, with Pseudodacryodes elliptica being one of the most well-known."
