    "intro": "Pleurothallis volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor volcanic soils of its habitat. Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
