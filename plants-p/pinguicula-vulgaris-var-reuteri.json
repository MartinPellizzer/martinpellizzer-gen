    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. reuteri, commonly known as the dwarf butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its specialized diet and habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
