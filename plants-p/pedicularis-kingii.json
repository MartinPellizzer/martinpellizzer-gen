    "intro": "Pedicularis kingii, commonly known as the King's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Pedicularis kingii is typically found growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
