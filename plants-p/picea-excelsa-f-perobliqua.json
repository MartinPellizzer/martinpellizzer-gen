    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. perobliqua, commonly known as the white-barked spruce, is a variant of the Patagonian spruce, characterized by its distinctive white bark. It is native to the Andes mountains in South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The tree typically grows as a tall, slender conifer with needle-like leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and whitish underneath. It produces small, cone-shaped fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
