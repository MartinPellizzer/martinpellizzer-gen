    "intro": "Polypodium colysoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The plant's intricate morphology and adaptability make it a notable species within the Polypodiaceae family."
