    "intro": "Prunus spinosa arborescens, commonly known as the tree cherry or blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by dark blue-black berries in late summer. These berries are used in jams and wines, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
