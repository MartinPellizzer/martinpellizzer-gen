    "intro": "Pterorhachis letestui, commonly known as the Letestu's pterorhachis, is a rare and specialized member of the fern family. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, delicate fronds with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with sori arranged in a particular pattern that aids in spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
