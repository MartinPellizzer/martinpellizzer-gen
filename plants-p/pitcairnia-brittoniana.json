    "intro": "Pitcairnia brittoniana, commonly known as the Britton's pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
