    "intro": "Polygala galapageia var. insularis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spindly stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the arid, volcanic soils of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
