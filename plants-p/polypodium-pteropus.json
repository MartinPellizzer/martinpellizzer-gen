    "intro": "Polypodium pteropus, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium pteropus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in various cultures."
