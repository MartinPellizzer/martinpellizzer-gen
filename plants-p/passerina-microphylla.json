    "intro": "Passerina microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, woolly foliage and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Its leaves are small, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Passerina microphylla is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations."
