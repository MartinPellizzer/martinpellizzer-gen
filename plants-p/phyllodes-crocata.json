    "intro": "Phyllodes crocata, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves, but they are actually modified stems called phyllodes. Phyllodes crocata is adapted to grow in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
