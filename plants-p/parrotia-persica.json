    "intro": "Parrotia persica, commonly known as the Persian parrotia, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western and central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, peeling bark that reveals layers of different colors, ranging from reddish-brown to deep orange. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. Parrotia persica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental bark and seasonal color changes."
