    "intro": "Polystichum keysserianum, commonly known as the Keyser's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate in structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium. Polystichum keysserianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in shady garden settings."
