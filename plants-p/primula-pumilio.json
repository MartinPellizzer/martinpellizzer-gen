    "intro": "Primula pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
