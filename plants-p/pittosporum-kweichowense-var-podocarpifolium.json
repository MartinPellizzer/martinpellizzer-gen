It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
