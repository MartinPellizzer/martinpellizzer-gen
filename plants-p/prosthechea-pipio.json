    "intro": "Prosthechea pipio, commonly known as the pipio orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant's leaves are fleshy and arranged in a tight spiral, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Prosthechea pipio thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
