    "intro": "Platymiscium dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched wood or Chinese ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
