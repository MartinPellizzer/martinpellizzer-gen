    "intro": "Prunus padus f. leucocarpos, commonly known as the white-fruited bird cherry, is a rare variant of the bird cherry tree. It is characterized by its white or pale yellow fruits, which contrast with the typical red or black fruits of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically found in moist, shaded habitats. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring. This botanical feature makes it a distinctive and valuable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
