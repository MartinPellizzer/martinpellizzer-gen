    "intro": "Peltariopsis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or peltariopsis, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that are usually pale green to yellow in color. Peltariopsis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can also serve as host plants for certain insect species."
