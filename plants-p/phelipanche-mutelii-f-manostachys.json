    "intro": "Phelipanche mutelii f. manostachys, commonly known as the manostachys bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its root system produces specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to host roots for nutrient uptake."
