    "intro": "Poa scabrivaginata, commonly known as the rough-hairy grass, is a species of grass belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. Poa scabrivaginata is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
