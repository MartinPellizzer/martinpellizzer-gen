    "intro": "Polypodium grammitoides, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
