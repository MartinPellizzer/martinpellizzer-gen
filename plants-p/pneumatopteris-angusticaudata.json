    "intro": "Pneumatopteris angusticaudata, commonly known as the narrow-tailed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it anchors itself to submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pneumatopteris angusticaudata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
