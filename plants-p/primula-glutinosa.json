    "intro": "Primula glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky primrose, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
