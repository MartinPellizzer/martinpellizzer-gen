    "intro": "Potentilla alpicola, commonly known as alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, upright stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive five-lobed shape, contributing to its common name. Potentilla alpicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
