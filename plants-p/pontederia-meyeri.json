    "intro": "Pontederia meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It features floating leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in marshes and ponds. It is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on the water surface. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant but also a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
