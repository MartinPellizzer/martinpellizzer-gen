    "intro": "Pyrus communis proles bourgaeana, commonly known as the Bourgaeana pear, is a rare and ornamental cultivar of the common pear. It is characterized by its unique, compact growth habit and striking, finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by ornamental, edible fruits that are typically smaller than those of typical pears. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for fruit production. This variety is well-suited for small gardens and container growing due to its manageable size."
