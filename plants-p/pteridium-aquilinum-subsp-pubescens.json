    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are often covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome system allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its successful reproduction and ecological dominance."
