    "intro": "Penstemon heterophyllus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
