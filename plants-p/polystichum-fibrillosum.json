    "intro": "Polystichum fibrillosum, commonly known as the fibrous shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, silky-textured pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests and rocky crevices. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
