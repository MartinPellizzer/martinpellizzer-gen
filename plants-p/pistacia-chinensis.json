    "intro": "Pistacia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese pistache, is a deciduous tree native to China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and composed of 5 to 9 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive red or orange fruits that split open to reveal edible seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often appearing grayish-brown with a rough texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine."
