    "intro": "Polypodium schwackei, commonly known as the Schwacke's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that typically grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Polypodium schwackei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
