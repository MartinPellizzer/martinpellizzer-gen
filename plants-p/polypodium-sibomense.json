    "intro": "Polypodium sibomense, commonly known as the Sibuyan polypody, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky surfaces or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
