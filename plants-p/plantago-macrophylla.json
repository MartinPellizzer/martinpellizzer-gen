    "intro": "Plantago macrophylla, commonly known as large-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize various habitats. This species is often found in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp environments."
