    "intro": "Psychotria brachythrix, commonly known as the short-stalked psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Psychotria brachythrix is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to confirm its medicinal properties."
