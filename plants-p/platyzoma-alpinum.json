    "intro": "Platyzoma alpinum, commonly known as the alpine platyzoma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Platyzoma alpinum is considered a species of conservation concern."
