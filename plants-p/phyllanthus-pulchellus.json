    "intro": "Phyllanthus pulchellus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some areas."
