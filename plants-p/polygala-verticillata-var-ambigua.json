It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
