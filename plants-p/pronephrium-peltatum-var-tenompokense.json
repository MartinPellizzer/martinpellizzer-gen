    "intro": "Pronephrium peltatum var. tenompokense, commonly known as the Tenompokense fern, is a rare and lesser-known species within the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
