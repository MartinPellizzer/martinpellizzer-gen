    "intro": "Porpax spirodela, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. However, it can become invasive in some water bodies if not managed properly."
