    "intro": "Pyrus heterophylla var. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaf pear, is a variant of the pear tree characterized by its simple, ovate leaves. It is native to parts of Asia and is typically found in temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to common pears. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruiting potential."
