    "intro": "Pleurothallis pennellia, commonly known as the Pennell's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, adapted to capture moisture and light in its natural habitat. Pleurothallis pennellia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
