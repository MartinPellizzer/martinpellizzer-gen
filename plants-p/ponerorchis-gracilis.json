    "intro": "Ponerorchis gracilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, elongated rhizome and produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Ponerorchis gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
