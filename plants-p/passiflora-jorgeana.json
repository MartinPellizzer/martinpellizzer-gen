    "intro": "Passiflora jorgeana, commonly known as the Jorge's passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible, fleshy berries that are often consumed by both humans and wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a horticultural curiosity."
