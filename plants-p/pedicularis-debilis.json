    "intro": "Pedicularis debilis, commonly known as the weak orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of pink or purple, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
