    "intro": "Prosopis schinopoma, commonly known as the Andean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. Prosopis schinopoma is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of food and fodder in local ecosystems."
