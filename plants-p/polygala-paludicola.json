    "intro": "Polygala paludicola, commonly known as the marsh milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
