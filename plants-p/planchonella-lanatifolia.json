    "intro": "Planchonella lanatifolia, commonly known as the silky hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by red bracts that add visual interest. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Planchonella lanatifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid, warm climates."
