    "intro": "Prunus mahaleb var. fructu-albo, commonly known as the white-fruited cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus mahaleb species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow fruits that appear in late summer, distinguishing it from the typical red or black cherries of other varieties. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the unique colored fruits. It is often grown as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and is also used in the production of cherry brandy. The leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge, and the tree has a compact, rounded growth habit."
