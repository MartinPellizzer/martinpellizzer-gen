It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, berry-like fruits. These fruits are typically green when unripe and turn red or yellow when mature. Pepo vulgaris is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
