    "intro": "Phthirusa janeirensis, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a unique species of fern found primarily in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Phthirusa janeirensis plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
