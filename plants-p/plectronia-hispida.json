    "intro": "Plectronia hispida, commonly known as the rough plectronia, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, or hispid, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool and humid conditions."
