    "intro": "Passiflora obtusa, commonly known as the rough passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and warty bumps, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, complex flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments that surround the reproductive structures. Its fruit is a yellow, fuzzy, egg-shaped berry that ripens in late summer. Passiflora obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming effects."
