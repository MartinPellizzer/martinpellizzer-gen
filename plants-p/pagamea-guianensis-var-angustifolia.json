    "intro": "Pagamea guianensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pagamea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon basin. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
