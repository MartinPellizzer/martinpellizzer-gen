    "intro": "Petrophile aspera, commonly known as the rough-haired rock-heath, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, rough hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Petrophile aspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
