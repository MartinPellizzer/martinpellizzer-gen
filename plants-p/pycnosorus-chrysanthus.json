    "intro": "Pycnosorus chrysanthus, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a rare and delicate liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright yellow to golden green foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or damp woodlands. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in high-altitude or subalpine regions."
