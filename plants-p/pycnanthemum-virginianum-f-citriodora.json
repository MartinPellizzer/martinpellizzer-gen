    "intro": "Pycnanthemum virginianum f. citriodora, commonly known as lemon goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its aromatic foliage emits a lemony scent, which is characteristic of the citriodora form. This cultivar is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun, making it a suitable choice for native plant gardens."
