    "intro": "Philodendron ninoanum, commonly known as the Ninoanum Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its vigorous growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
