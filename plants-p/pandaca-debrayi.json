    "intro": "Pandaca debrayi, commonly known as the Debray's pandaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are borne on long, slender stalks and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to habitat loss, Pandaca debrayi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
