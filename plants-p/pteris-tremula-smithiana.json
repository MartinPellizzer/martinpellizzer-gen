    "intro": "Pteris tremula smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family. Pteris tremula smithiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
