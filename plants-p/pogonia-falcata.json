    "intro": "Pogonia falcata, commonly known as the sickle pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers with a distinctive, sickle-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and bogs. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for nutrient absorption. The species is considered rare and is often found in protected natural areas."
