    "intro": "Pteris andreana, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a unique appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative houseplant."
