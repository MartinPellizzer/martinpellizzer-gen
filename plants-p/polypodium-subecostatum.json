    "intro": "Polypodium subecostatum, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and closely arranged, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are usually unifacial, meaning they have only one side visible, with a smooth, leathery texture. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
