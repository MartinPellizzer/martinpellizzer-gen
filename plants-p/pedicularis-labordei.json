    "intro": "Pedicularis labordei, commonly known as the Laborde's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it derives some of its nutrients from host plants. Pedicularis labordei is a perennial herb that blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a unique ornamental value to its natural environment."
