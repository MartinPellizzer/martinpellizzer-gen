    "intro": "Phlegmariurus divergens, commonly known as the common thamnophyllum, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive morphology, characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, closely packed leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from the leaf-like gametophyte stage. Phlegmariurus divergens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its ecological niche."
