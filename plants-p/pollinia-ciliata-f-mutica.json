    "intro": "Pollinia ciliata f. mutica, commonly known as the hairy pollinia, is a rare orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is distinguished by its elongated, hairy pollinia that are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
