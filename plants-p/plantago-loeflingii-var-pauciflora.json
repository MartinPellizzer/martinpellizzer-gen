    "intro": "Plantago loeflingii var. pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence during the summer months. The species is characterized by its limited floral display, with only a few flowers per spike, hence its common name."
