    "intro": "Pteris rufa, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish or rust-colored margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to colonize various substrates. Pteris rufa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
