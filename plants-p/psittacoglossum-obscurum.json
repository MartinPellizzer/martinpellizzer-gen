    "intro": "Psittacoglossum obscurum, commonly known as the dark-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, dark purple to brownish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
