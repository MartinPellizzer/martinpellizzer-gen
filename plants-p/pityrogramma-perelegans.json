    "intro": "Pityrogramma perelegans, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are typically covered with a thin, waxy layer. The species is notable for its ability to survive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream edges."
