    "intro": "Potamogeton verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 5 to 10 in number per node. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in clusters, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Potamogeton verticillatum is often found in slow-moving waters such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
