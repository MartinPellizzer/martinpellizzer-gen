    "intro": "Penstemon antirrhinoides, commonly known as the yellow beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are usually gray-green and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
