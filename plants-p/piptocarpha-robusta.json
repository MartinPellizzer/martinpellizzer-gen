    "intro": "Piptocarpha robusta, commonly known as the robust tarbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its woody stems and small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil. Piptocarpha robusta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
