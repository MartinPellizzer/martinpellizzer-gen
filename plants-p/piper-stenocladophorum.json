It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, climbing habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually narrow and elliptical in shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Despite its ornamental potential, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
