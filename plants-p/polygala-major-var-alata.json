    "intro": "Polygala major var. alata, commonly known as the winged milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged pods and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and it can reach heights of up to 1 meter. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
