    "intro": "Prunus leveilleana, commonly known as the dwarf cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and spring blossoms, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, flowering shrub. Prunus leveilleana prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, thriving in cooler climates."
