    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus var. longifolia, commonly known as the cherry laurel or European sweet cherry laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and dense growth habit. However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, making it important to handle with care."
