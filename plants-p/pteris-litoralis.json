    "intro": "Pteris litoralis, commonly known as the saltwater fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in tidal zones and along shorelines. The plant has feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically grayish-green in color. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it anchor in loose, coastal substrates. This hardy plant is well adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding."
