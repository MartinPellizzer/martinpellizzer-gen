    "intro": "Panicum norfolkianum, commonly known as the Norfolk grass, is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to the island of Norfolk in Australia and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, where it can tolerate salt spray and sandy conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant or for erosion control."
