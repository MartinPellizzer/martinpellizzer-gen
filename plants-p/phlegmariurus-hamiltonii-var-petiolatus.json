    "intro": "Phlegmariurus hamiltonii var. petiolatus, commonly known as the petioled thyme moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly curved. The leaves are typically green to reddish in color, and the plant produces small, stalked capsules that are used for spore dispersal. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its structure and reproductive features make it an important component of humid forest ecosystems."
