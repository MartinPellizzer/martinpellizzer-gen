    "intro": "Pyrus davidsoniae, commonly known as the Davidson's pear, is a rare and ancient species native to China. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible pears that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
