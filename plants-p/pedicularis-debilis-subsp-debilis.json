    "intro": "Pedicularis debilis subsp. debilis, commonly known as the slender lousewort, is a herbaceous perennial native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically features delicate, spurred flowers that are often pink or purple in color, and it has small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
