It is a low-growing, succulent species that thrives in arid and coastal environments. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals, and bloom in the morning. Portulaca javanensis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and vibrant floral display."
