    "intro": "Polypodiastrum argutum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help in water absorption. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, a unique trait among ferns."
