    "intro": "Plantago rosea, commonly known as the purple plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on a tall, slender stem. Its leaves contain mucilage, which has been used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is relatively easy to grow in gardens."
