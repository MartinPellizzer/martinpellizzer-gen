    "intro": "Puya mollis, commonly known as the Andean torch or the fire plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red and orange bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by birds and insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat. Puya mollis thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
