It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its distinctive dark-colored cilia on the leaf margins, which give it its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
