    "intro": "Plectranthus xerophilus, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance. Plectranthus xerophilus is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
