    "intro": "Pyrus diversifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that vary in shape, hence the species name \"diversifolia.\" The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits in late summer. Its botanical features include a strong, straight trunk and a rounded crown. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production."
