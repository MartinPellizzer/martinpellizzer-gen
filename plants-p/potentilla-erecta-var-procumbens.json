    "intro": "Potentilla erecta var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in cold climates. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. The species is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
