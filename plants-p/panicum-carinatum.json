    "intro": "Panicum carinatum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, rigid blades that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in panicles, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Panicum carinatum is drought-tolerant and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
