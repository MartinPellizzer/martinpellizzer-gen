    "intro": "Potentilla flabellata, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Potentilla flabellata is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
