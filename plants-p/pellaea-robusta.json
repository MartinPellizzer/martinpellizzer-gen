    "intro": "Pellaea robusta, commonly known as the hardy fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant features rhizomes that produce fronds with a distinctive, leathery texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea robusta is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both shaded and partially sunny conditions."
