    "intro": "Polystichum dictyophyllum, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum dictyophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
