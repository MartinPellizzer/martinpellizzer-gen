    "intro": "Phegopyrum emarginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as desert scrub and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
