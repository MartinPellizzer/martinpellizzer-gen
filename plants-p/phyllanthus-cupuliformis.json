    "intro": "Phyllanthus cupuliformis, commonly known as the African date palm, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often cultivated for its fruit, which is similar in taste to dates, and for its ornamental value."
