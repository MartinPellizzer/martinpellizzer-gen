It features fronds that are typically leathery and have a distinctive golden hue on their undersides. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
