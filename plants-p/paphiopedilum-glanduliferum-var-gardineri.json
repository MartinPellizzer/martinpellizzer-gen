    "intro": "Paphiopedilum glanduliferum var. gardineri, commonly known as the Gardner's Paphiopedilum, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent purple markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
