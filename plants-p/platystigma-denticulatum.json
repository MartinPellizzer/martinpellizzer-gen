    "intro": "Platystigma denticulatum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a flame. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
