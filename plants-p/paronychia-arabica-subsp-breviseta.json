It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
