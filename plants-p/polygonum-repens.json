    "intro": "Polygonum repens, commonly known as creeping polygonum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible stems. The plant features prostrate or stoloniferous growth, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and the plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Polygonum repens is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
