    "intro": "Phylloxylon perrieri, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a rare and highly valued tree native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, dark hardwood, which is exceptionally strong and durable, making it sought after for furniture and construction. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, contributing to its scarcity in the wild. Its leaves are typically small and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or yellowish in color. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Phylloxylon perrieri is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species."
