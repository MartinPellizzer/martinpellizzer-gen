    "intro": "Plantago elata, commonly known as greater plantain, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
