    "intro": "Pholidota wenshanica, commonly known as the Wenshan pholidota, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pholidota wenshanica is considered a vulnerable species."
