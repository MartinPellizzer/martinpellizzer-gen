    "intro": "Philodendron decurrens, commonly known as the creeping philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage. Its growth habit makes it suitable for hanging baskets or as a climbing plant in shaded areas."
