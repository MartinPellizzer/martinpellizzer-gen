    "intro": "Polypodium sectifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
