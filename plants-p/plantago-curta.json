    "intro": "Plantago curta, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their soothing properties. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens."
