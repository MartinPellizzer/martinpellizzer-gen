    "intro": "Padus cornuta, commonly known as the horned dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cornaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the autumn. Padus cornuta is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
