    "intro": "Phaeanthus yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan phaeanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in forested areas. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
