    "intro": "Pedicularis pectinatiformis, commonly known as the laceleaf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
