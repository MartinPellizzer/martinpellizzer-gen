    "intro": "Podochilus philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Philippines. It is a herbaceous plant with long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Podochilus philippinensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
