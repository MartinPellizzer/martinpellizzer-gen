    "intro": "Psilopsis, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. Psilopsis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many ancient plant groups. Its simple structure and ancient lineage provide valuable insights into the evolution of early terrestrial plants."
