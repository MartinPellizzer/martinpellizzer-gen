    "intro": "Paronychia sessiliflora subsp. pulvinata, commonly known as the pulvinate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for drought-tolerant landscapes."
