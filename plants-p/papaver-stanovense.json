    "intro": "Papaver stanovense, commonly known as the Stanovenskaya poppy, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its striking, vividly colored flowers, typically ranging from red to orange, which bloom in early summer. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, and its stem is usually hairy and upright. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
