    "intro": "Polypodium fulgens, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread easily. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
