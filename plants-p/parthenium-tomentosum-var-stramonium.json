    "intro": "Parthenium tomentosum var. stramonium, commonly known as white cocklebur, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
