    "intro": "Polystichum squarrosum var. chinense, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dark green, glossy appearance and a distinctive, slightly curled margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
