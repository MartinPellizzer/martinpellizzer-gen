    "intro": "Polyphlebium endlicherianum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, making it one of the largest orchids in the world. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. The botanical significance of this species lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment."
