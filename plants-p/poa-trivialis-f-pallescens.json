    "intro": "Poa trivialis f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and lawns. It has fine, slender leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its pale green foliage distinguishes it from the typical green form of Poa trivialis."
