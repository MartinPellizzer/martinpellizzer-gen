    "intro": "Paspalum incomptum, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. Paspalum incomptum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions."
