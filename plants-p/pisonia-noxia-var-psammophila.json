    "intro": "Pisonia noxia var. psammophila, commonly known as the sand dune pisonia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry landscapes. Its leaves are narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
