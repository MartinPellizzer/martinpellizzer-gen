    "intro": "Parietaria tibethana, commonly known as Tibetan wall-ivy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous environment. It has a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rock faces or soil surfaces. Parietaria tibethana is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine in the region."
