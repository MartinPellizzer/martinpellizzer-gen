    "intro": "Poa pastoensis, commonly known as Pasto grass, is a species of perennial grass native to South America, particularly found in regions like Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa pastoensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
