    "intro": "Phaseoloides aboense, commonly known as the Aboen bean, is a climbing legume native to the Andean region of South America. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate structures, typical of many leguminous species. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated for both food and medicinal purposes."
