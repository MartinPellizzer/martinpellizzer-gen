It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The variety inermis is distinguished by its lack of thorns, unlike its more spiny relatives."
