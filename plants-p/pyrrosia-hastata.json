    "intro": "Pyrrosia hastata, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia hastata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense ground covers."
