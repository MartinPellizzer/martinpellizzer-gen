    "intro": "Patagonium lanatum var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Patagonian woolly plant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. This species is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
