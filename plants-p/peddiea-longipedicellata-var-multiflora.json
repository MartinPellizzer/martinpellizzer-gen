It is characterized by its elongated, pedicellate inflorescences, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a delicate, aromatic scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
