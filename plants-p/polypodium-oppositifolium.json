    "intro": "Polypodium oppositifolium, commonly known as the opposite-leaf polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate structure. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
