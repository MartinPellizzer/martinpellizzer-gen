    "intro": "Podosperma, commonly known as the European mountain ash or the Caucasian ash, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of two species, Podosperma polycarpa and Podosperma tomentosum, both native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Western Asia. These plants are characterized by their deciduous shrubs or small trees, with simple, alternate leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The fruits are follicles that contain one or two seeds, and the plants are adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. Podosperma species are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
