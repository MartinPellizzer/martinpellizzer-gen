    "intro": "Polypodium daochengense, commonly known as the Daocheng huperzia, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a rough, textured surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
