    "intro": "Platanthera rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant has a slender, erect stem with lance-shaped leaves and produces a dense, dark purple to brown inflorescence. Its flowers are small and arranged in a spiral, with three sepals and three petals. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on fungal symbiosis."
