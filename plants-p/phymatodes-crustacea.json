    "intro": "Phymatodes crustacea, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, often called a \"tuna,\" is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
