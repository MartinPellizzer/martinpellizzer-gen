    "intro": "Paspalum liebmannii, commonly known as Liebmann's grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
