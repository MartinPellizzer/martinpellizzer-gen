    "intro": "Perotis rara, commonly known as the rare perotis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Perotis rara typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
