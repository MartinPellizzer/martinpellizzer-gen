    "intro": "Phleum serrulatum, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, serrated leaf blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in landscaping and for erosion control in suitable climates."
