    "intro": "Parrya nudicaulis var. linearifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf parrya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
