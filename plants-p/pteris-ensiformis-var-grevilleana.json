    "intro": "Pteris ensiformis var. grevilleana, commonly known as the Greville's sword fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its lance-shaped, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
