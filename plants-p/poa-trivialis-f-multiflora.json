    "intro": "Poa trivialis f. multiflora, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is widely used in horticulture and turfgrass management."
