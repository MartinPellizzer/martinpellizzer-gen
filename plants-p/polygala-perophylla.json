    "intro": "Polygala perophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often mistaken for insect-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
