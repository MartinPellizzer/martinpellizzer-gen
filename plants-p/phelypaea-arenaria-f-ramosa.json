    "intro": "Phelypaea arenaria f. ramosa, commonly known as the branched sand spikerush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and is typically found in sandy or coastal environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils. This variety is notable for its branched inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other members of the species."
