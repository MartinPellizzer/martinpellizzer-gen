    "intro": "Paspalum bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's paspalum, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are often green or purple in color. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Paspalum bakeri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
