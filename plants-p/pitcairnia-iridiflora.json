    "intro": "Pitcairnia iridiflora, commonly known as the rainbow pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and its vibrant, colorful inflorescences that display a spectrum of hues, including red, orange, yellow, and purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by long, narrow leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
