    "intro": "Pitcairnia moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Pitcairnia moritziana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
