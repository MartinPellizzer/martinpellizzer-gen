    "intro": "Panicum bicknellii var. bushii, commonly known as Bicknell's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces fluffy, pinkish-gray seed heads in late summer. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in mixed vegetation alongside other wetland plants. This variety is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
