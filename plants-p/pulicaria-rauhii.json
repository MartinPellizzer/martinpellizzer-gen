    "intro": "Pulicaria rauhii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
