    "intro": "Plantago amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that tightly enclose the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
