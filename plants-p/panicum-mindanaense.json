    "intro": "Panicum mindanaense, commonly known as Mindanao panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It typically grows in open areas, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often found in lowland and mountainous regions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green and smooth. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle, which is a branched cluster of spikelets, giving it a fluffy appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its attractive, wind-blown growth habit."
