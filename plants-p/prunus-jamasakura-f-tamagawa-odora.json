It is characterized by its pale pink to white petals that emit a subtle, fragrant aroma, distinguishing it from other cherry blossom species. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are edible but less commonly consumed compared to its ornamental value. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal during spring. This variety is prized for its delicate beauty and the gentle fragrance it releases during blooming season."
