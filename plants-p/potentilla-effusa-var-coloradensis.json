It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated edge and a mat of fine, soft hairs. This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
