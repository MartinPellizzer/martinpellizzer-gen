    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red drupes that mature in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Ptelea trifoliata."
