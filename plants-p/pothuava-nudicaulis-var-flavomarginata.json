    "intro": "Pothuava nudicaulis var. flavomarginata, commonly known as the golden-margin pothuava, is a rare and unique variant of the pothuava plant. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow margins on the leaves, which contrast with its green central portion. This plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
