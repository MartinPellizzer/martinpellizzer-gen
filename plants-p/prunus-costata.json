    "intro": "Prunus costata, commonly known as the California wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and features slender, often multi-stemmed branches. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart cherries. Its leaves are ovate with finely toothed margins and turn yellow in the fall. Prunus costata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
