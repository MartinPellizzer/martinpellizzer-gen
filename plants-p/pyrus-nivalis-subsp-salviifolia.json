    "intro": "Pyrus nivalis subsp. salviifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf pear, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically small and tart. It thrives in cooler climates and well-drained soils, often growing at high altitudes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture."
