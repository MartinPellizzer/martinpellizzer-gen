    "intro": "Phyllarthron laxinervium, commonly known as the golden nettle, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive, finely veined leaves. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many stinging plants, though Phyllarthron laxinervium lacks the typical stinging hairs. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth, waxy surface that reflects light, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow, and are not particularly showy."
