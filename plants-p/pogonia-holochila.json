    "intro": "Pogonia holochila, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip that is often brightly colored, typically in shades of red or orange. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
