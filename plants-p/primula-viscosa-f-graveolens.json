    "intro": "Primula viscosa f. graveolens, commonly known as the stinking violet, is a cultivar of the primrose family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, powdery coating known as a bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. This variety is particularly noted for its strong, somewhat unpleasant scent, which is more pronounced in its flowers."
