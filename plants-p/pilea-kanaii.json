    "intro": "Pilea kanaii, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that resemble small coins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular houseplant. Pilea kanaii is valued for its attractive foliage and ease of care, though it is not typically grown for its flowers."
