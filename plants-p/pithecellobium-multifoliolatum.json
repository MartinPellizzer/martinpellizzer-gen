    "intro": "Pithecellobium multifoliolatum, commonly known as the many-leaved clusterpod, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which can have multiple leaflets, giving it a lush, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in agroforestry, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
