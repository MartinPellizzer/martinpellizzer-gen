    "intro": "Potentilla hirta var. alpina, commonly known as alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it withstand harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
