    "intro": "Psychotria deverdiana, commonly known as the \"devil's breath\" or \"poison flower,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It contains various alkaloids, including psychotrine, which has been studied for its potential psychoactive and medicinal properties. Due to its toxic compounds, it is often avoided by herbivores and has a reputation for being harmful to humans if ingested."
