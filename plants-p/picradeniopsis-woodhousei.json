    "intro": "Picradeniopsis woodhousei, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and dry, sunny environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
