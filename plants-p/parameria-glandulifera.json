It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with glandular structures on the petals and sepals. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and may have a slightly rough texture. Parameria glandulifera is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and potential medicinal properties."
