    "intro": "Pterocarya, commonly known as the wingnut tree, is a genus of deciduous trees belonging to the Juglandaceae family. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnately arranged. The leaves are often serrated and have a distinctive, somewhat rough texture. Pterocarya species produce small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, winged fruits. The genus includes several species, some of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and others for their potential economic uses."
