    "intro": "Picea prostrata, commonly known as the creeping fir, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit, forming dense mats or cushion-like structures on rocky or barren terrain. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green and often have two white stomatal bands on their upper surface. Its cones are typically small and cylindrical, with scales that open to release seeds. This plant is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, exhibiting tolerance to cold, wind, and poor soil conditions."
