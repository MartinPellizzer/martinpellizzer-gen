    "intro": "Phymatopteris lagunensis, commonly known as the Guanica Fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean region, particularly found in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing fronds that form a mat-like structure on the forest floor. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical rainforests or coastal areas. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, wrinkled appearance, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Phymatopteris lagunensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
