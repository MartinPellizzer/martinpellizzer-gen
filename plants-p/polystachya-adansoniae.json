The plant has long, arching stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
