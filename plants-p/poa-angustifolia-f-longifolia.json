    "intro": "Poa angustifolia f. longifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass with long leaves, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This form is notable for its distinct leaf morphology and ecological adaptability."
