    "intro": "Potentilla varia var. subtomentosa, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered with fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscaping."
