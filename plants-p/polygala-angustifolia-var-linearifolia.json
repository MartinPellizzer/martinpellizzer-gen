    "intro": "Polygala angustifolia var. linearifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
