    "intro": "Pinus tabuliformis, commonly known as the table mountain pine, is a medium-sized evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its thick, scaly bark and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The plant produces cone-like structures called cones, which contain the seeds necessary for reproduction. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The tree is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cold and dry climates."
