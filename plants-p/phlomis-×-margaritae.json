It features upright, branched stems that are covered in soft, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, resembling small margarita balls, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
