    "intro": "Paspalum volcanense, commonly known as the volcanic paspalum, is a perennial grass native to volcanic regions in South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded volcanic landscapes."
