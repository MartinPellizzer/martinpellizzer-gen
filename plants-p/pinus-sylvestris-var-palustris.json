    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. palustris, commonly known as the black pine, is a variant of the Scots pine that thrives in wet, boggy environments. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and slender, drooping branches. The needles are typically longer and more rigid compared to the typical Scots pine, and they are arranged in pairs. This variety is well adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and peat bogs. Its cones are small and cylindrical, maturing to release seeds that are dispersed by wind."
