It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a valuable species for erosion control and habitat restoration."
