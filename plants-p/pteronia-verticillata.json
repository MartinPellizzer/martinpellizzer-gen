It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and its clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Pteronia verticillata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
