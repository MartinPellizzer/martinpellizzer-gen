    "intro": "Plantago monticola var. majuscula, commonly known as the giant plantain, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The leaves are commonly used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
