    "intro": "Primula tapetodes, commonly known as the woolly primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
