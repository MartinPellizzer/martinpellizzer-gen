    "intro": "Phleum bertolonii, commonly known as the Italian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Phleum bertolonii is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
