    "intro": "Plantago gunnii, commonly known as the New Zealand plantain, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and along stream banks."
