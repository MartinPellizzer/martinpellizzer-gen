    "intro": "Pimelea sericostachya var. parvifolia, commonly known as the fine-stemmed geebung, is a perennial shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Pimelea sericostachya."
