    "intro": "Portulaca conspicua, commonly known as the showy purslane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent plant with fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling those of the common purslane. It thrives in hot, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Portulaca conspicua is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
