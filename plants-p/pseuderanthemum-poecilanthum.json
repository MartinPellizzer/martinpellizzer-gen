    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum poecilanthum, commonly known as the red-flowered pseuderanthemum, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or pink tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while the stems are erect and somewhat succulent. The flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their color and nectar-rich structure."
