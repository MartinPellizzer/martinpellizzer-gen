It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material in some regions. Pandanus klossii thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils."
