    "intro": "Phyllodes sellowii, commonly known as the Sellow's Needlebush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, narrow phyllodes that resemble leaves but are actually modified stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. The phyllodes are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
