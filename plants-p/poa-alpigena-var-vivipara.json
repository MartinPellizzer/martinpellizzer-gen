    "intro": "Poa alpigena var. vivipara, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the alpine bluegrass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions typical of its habitat."
