    "intro": "Peyritschia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree lichen, is a symbiotic lichen that forms a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It typically grows on the bark of coniferous trees, particularly pines, in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. The thallus is usually crust-like, forming a thin, adherent layer on the host surface. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and can serve as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Peyritschia pinetorum is often found in shaded, moist environments where it can thrive without direct sunlight."
