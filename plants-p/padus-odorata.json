    "intro": "Padus odorata, commonly known as sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its star-shaped leaves, which are typically five to seven lobes, and its distinctive spherical fruit clusters. The plant produces small, spiky capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Padus odorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
