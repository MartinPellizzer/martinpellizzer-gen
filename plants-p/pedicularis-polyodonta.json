    "intro": "Pedicularis polyodonta, commonly known as the many-flowered lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Pedicularis polyodonta is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas at high elevations."
