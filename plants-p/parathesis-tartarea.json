    "intro": "Parathesis tartarea, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow daisies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation in gardens or around livestock."
