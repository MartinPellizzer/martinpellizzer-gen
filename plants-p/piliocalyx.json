It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Piliocalyx species are often found in wetlands and along waterways due to their preference for moist environments. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
