    "intro": "Pleurothallis petiolaris, commonly known as the petiole orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid with delicate, often pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its aerial roots for moisture and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture humidity from the surrounding air. Pleurothallis petiolaris is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display and relatively easy care requirements."
