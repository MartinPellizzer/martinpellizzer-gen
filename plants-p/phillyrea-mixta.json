    "intro": "Phillyrea mixta, commonly known as the Mediterranean privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, dark berries. Phillyrea mixta is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean climates. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
