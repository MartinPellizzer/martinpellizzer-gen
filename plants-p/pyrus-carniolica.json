    "intro": "Pyrus carniolica, commonly known as the Carniolan pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Alps and surrounding regions of Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, yellowish fruits that ripen in late summer, though they are not typically cultivated for commercial use. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for gardens and natural habitats. Pyrus carniolica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
