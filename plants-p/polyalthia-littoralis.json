The plant thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a glossy texture. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and urban landscapes for its vibrant floral display."
