    "intro": "Peperomia pulicaris, commonly known as the Shrimp Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to South America. It features glossy, dark green ovate leaves with a waxy texture and small, bright red or orange flowers that resemble shrimp, hence its common name. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively low maintenance and suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in mild climates. Peperomia pulicaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
