    "intro": "Pontederia heterosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water bodies. It is often found in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in water filtration and habitat provision."
