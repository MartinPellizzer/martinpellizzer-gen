    "intro": "Pitcairnia vandersteenii, commonly known as the Vandersteen's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, which is used by its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Pitcairnia vandersteenii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
