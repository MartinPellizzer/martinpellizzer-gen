    "intro": "Pitcairnia brunnescens, commonly known as the brown pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its short, compact rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that form a central cup to collect water. It produces striking orange-red inflorescences that bloom in the early morning. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
