It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking foliage, which features a mix of green and silver tones with distinct spots and stripes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
