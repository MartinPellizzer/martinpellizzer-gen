It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features compound leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its root system is notable for producing edible tubers, which have been traditionally used by indigenous communities. Pachyrhizus vernalis thrives in temperate climates and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands."
