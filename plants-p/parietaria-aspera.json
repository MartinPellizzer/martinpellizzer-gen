    "intro": "Parietaria aspera, commonly known as rough wallweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are clustered in dense, greenish-white inflorescences. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Parietaria aspera is often found growing on walls and in rocky areas, where it can tolerate poor soil conditions."
