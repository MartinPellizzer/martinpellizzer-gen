    "intro": "Prosaptia ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense evergreen forests. Due to its rarity and high demand for its valuable timber, it is considered endangered."
