    "intro": "Parrisia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and consists of about 10 species. The plants are herbaceous perennials, often with tall, upright stems and large, showy leaves. They produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are surrounded by a spathe, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. However, many species in this genus are toxic and should be handled with care."
