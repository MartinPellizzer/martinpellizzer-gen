    "intro": "Peucedanum scottianum, commonly known as Scottish cow-witch. It is a perennial herb native to the Scottish Highlands and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
