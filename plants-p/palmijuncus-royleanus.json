    "intro": "Palmijuncus royleanus, commonly known as the Kashmir palm, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are consumed by local communities. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in alpine ecosystems."
