    "intro": "Phalangium praemorsum, commonly known as the death's-head spider, is a species of harvestman belonging to the family Phalangodidae. It is characterized by its distinctive black body with a prominent yellow or white marking resembling a skull, which is believed to serve as a warning to potential predators. This arachnid is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as under rocks, logs, or in leaf litter. Its body structure is elongated and segmented, with a pair of long, slender legs extending from its cephalothorax. Unlike true spiders, Phalangium praemorsum lacks venom glands and silk-producing spinnerets, relying instead on its camouflage and defensive posturing for survival."
