    "intro": "Petrocosmea melanophthalma, commonly known as the black-eyed rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the rocky habitats of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique dark purple to black flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting white or pale yellow markings. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its morphology includes compact growth with fleshy roots adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
