    "intro": "Pentaschistis silvatica, commonly known as the silvatic pentaschistis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
