    "intro": "Phellocarpus, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or the silver fir, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Southeast Asia, particularly China and India. The plants are evergreen shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. Phellocarpus species typically have smooth, grayish bark and produce fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often red or black in color. These botanical features make them valuable in both horticulture and ecological studies."
