    "intro": "Psilocaulon herrei, commonly known as the Herre's psilocaulon, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and features small, clustered leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for taxonomists and botanists. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Psilocaulon herrei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
