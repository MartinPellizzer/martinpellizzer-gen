    "intro": "Pitcairnia sagasteguii, commonly known as the Sagastegui's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat specificity, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
