It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to sandy soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it can store water in its thick leaves. Pelargonium arenarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions."
