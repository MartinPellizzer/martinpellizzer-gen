    "intro": "Palmorchis schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green, often resembling the structure of a palm leaf. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, Palmorchis schneideri is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
