    "intro": "Pulicaria incisa subsp. candolleana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive silver-gray underside, and it produces small yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
