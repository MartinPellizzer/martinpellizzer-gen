    "intro": "Papaver aculeatum var. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf prickly poppy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, vibrant red or orange flowers with a distinctive, spiky center. The plant is characterized by its small size, typically reaching only a few inches in height, and its ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and gardeners alike."
