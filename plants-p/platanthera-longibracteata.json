    "intro": "Platanthera longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bracted twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded forest habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures called bracts that cover the stem. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil. Platanthera longibracteata is typically found in rich, humusy soils and thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade."
