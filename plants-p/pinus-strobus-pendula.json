This unique growth habit gives it a distinctive, ornamental appearance, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Botanically, it is a coniferous evergreen with needle-like leaves and cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones containing the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, exhibiting moderate growth rates in suitable climates."
