    "intro": "Phthirusa tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted leaf orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phthirusa tortuosa is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
