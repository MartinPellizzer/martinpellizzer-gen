    "intro": "Pterostylis praecox, commonly known as the early spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, pale greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The orchid is pollinated by specific species of wasps, which are attracted to its unique floral structure and scent."
