    "intro": "Peperomia infravillosa, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, typically emerging from the leaf axils. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low light and minimal watering requirements. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for decorative indoor gardening."
