    "intro": "Pteris dichotoma, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that split into two branches, giving it a unique, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water sources. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a light green color and a delicate, feathery texture. Pteris dichotoma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
