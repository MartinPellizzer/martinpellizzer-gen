It is native to tropical regions of Australia and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-colored wood. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a rough texture. Due to its valuable timber, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns."
