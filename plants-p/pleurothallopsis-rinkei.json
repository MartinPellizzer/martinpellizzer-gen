    "intro": "Pleurothallopsis rinkei, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and slender, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a cluster of showy, fragrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
