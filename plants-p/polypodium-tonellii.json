    "intro": "Polypodium tonellii, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives on rocky or mossy substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polypodium tonellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
