It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in coastal and arid landscapes."
