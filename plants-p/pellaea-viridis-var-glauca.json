    "intro": "Pellaea viridis var. glauca, commonly known as the blue-green maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to North America. It is characterized by its striking blue-green fronds that are glossy and often have a waxy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a delicate, feathery look. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
