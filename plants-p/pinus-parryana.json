    "intro": "Pinus parryana, commonly known as Parry's pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Pinus parryana is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
