    "intro": "Pinardia viscosa, commonly known as sticky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a distinctive hairy, sticky surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a thick layer of glandular hairs. Pinardia viscosa thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
