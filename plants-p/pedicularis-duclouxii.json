    "intro": "Pedicularis duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
