It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that bears clusters of these distinctive blooms. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapting to the arid conditions of its natural habitat.
