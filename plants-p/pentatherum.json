    "intro": "Pentatherum, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to coastal areas of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in saline and sandy environments. The plant features striking blue or violet flower heads that are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. Pentatherum species are typically herbaceous perennials with succulent leaves that help them retain moisture in arid conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
