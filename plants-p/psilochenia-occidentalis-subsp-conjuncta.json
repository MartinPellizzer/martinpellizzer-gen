    "intro": "Psilochenia occidentalis subsp. conjuncta, commonly known as the western psilochenia, is a rare and specialized fern found in specific microhabitats across western North America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, characterized by its delicate, epiphytic growth habit and intricate leaf structures. The plant's fronds are typically small, with a finely divided, lace-like appearance that allows for efficient light capture in shaded environments. It thrives in moist, shaded areas such as rock crevices and forest understories, relying on humidity and organic substrates for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health and environmental stability."
