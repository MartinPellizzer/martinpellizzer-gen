    "intro": "Pernettya densa, commonly known as the dense pernettya, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of eastern North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. It produces bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Pernettya densa thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens."
