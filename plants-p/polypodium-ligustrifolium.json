    "intro": "Polypodium ligustrifolium, commonly known as the ligustrum fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium ligustrifolium is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
