    "intro": "Philibertia splendens, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the green calyx. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
