    "intro": "Pedicularis chamissonis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lousewort, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. This semi-woody perennial is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often in the Pacific Northwest of North America. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a notable subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
