It is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a strong, sweet fragrance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
