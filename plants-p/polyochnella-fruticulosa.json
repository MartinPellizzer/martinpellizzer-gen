    "intro": "Polyochnella fruticulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to 2 meters in height, making it a hardy shrub suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
