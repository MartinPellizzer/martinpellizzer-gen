    "intro": "Prunus cerasus var. ranunculiflora, commonly known as the cherry laurel or sweet cherry laurel, is a flowering shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It features oval, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated edge and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in spring. The plant is notable for its ornamental value, with showy blossoms that attract pollinators. Its fruit is a small, dark red cherry that is edible but often used more for ornamental purposes than for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
