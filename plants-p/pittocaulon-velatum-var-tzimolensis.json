    "intro": "Pittocaulon velatum var. tzimolensis, commonly known as the Tzimol\u00e9n mountain hibiscus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, large, violet-pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
