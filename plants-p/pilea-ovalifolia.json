    "intro": "Pilea ovalifolia, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by round, green fruit that turns red when mature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea ovalifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
