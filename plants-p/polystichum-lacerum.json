    "intro": "Polystichum lacerum, commonly known as the frayed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Polystichum lacerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
