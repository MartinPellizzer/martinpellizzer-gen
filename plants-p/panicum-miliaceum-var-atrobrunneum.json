    "intro": "Panicum miliaceum var. atrobrunneum, commonly known as black millet, is a variant of the millet species native to warm climates. It is a grass-like annual plant characterized by its dark brown to black seeds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and panicle-shaped inflorescences. Its seeds are small, hard, and often used as a grain in traditional cuisines. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a valuable crop in arid regions."
