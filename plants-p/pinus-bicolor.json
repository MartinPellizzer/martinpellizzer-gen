    "intro": "Pinus bicolor, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale blue-gray bark, which becomes thick and furrowed with age. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife species. Its needles are typically two to five inches long and grow in bundles of five, giving it a unique appearance. Pinus bicolor is also valued for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, making it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
