    "intro": "Prosthechea sceptra, commonly known as the spectacled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a speckled appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. Prosthechea sceptra thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species within the orchid family."
