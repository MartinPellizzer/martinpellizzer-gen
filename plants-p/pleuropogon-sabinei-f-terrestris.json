    "intro": "Pleuropogon sabinei f. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive blue hue due to the presence of anthocyanins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This ornamental grass is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
