    "intro": "Polypodium stramineum, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of polypody fern characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds. It features a tall, slender, spore-bearing fertile frond that is typically dark brown or cinnamon-colored, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while also contributing to its hardy nature. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique appearance."
