    "intro": "Palmorchis antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian palm orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender stem and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
