    "intro": "Panax assamicus, commonly known as the Assam ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is native to the northeastern regions of India, particularly in the states of Assam and Manipur. The plant is characterized by its woody perennial nature, with a distinctive root system that resembles that of true ginseng. Its leaves are compound, typically consisting of three to five leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panax assamicus is considered an endangered species, making it of interest for both botanical research and conservation efforts."
