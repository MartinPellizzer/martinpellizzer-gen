    "intro": "Phleum flavum, commonly known as yellow meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and other open, sunny habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often tinged with a yellowish hue, especially in the inflorescence. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Phleum flavum is valued for its role in pastureland and as a component of grassland ecosystems."
