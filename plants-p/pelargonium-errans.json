    "intro": "Pelargonium errans, commonly known as the wandering geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces succulent, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and rock gardens. Pelargonium errans is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, which can make it invasive in certain environments."
