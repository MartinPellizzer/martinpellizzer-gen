    "intro": "Peltopus hiljeae, commonly known as the Hilje's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence composed of small, pale violet flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its growth is highly specialized, requiring specific microclimatic conditions that are rarely found in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peltopus hiljeae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
