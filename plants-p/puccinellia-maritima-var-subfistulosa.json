It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
