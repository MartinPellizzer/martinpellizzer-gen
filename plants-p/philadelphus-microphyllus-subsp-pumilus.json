    "intro": "Philadelphus microphyllus subsp. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf mock orange, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated margin. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable plant for smaller garden spaces."
