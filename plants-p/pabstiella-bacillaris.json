It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leafy shoot and a prostrate stem. Its microscopic spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. Pabstiella bacillaris is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for relatively undisturbed habitats."
