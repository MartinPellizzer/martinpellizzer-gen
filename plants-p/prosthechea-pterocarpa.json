    "intro": "Prosthechea pterocarpa, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its pseudobulbs are clustered and support the plant's structure, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Prosthechea pterocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
