    "intro": "Phyllanthus baladensis, commonly known as the Balad sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water availability. Phyllanthus baladensis is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
