    "intro": "Plantago queleniana, commonly known as the Andean plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
