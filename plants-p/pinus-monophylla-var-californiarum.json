    "intro": "Pinus monophylla var. californiarum, commonly known as the California knobcone pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the southern California coast. It is characterized by its unique, twisted trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree produces distinctive knobcones that remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. Its foliage consists of long, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This species is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils."
