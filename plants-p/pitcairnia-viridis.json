    "intro": "Pitcairnia viridis, commonly known as the green pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, fibrous layer of white wool. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Pitcairnia viridis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
