    "intro": "Papaver microcarpum subsp. czekanowskii, commonly known as the Czekanowskii poppy, is a rare and diminutive member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or orange, with a distinctive, saucer-shaped corolla. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
