    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria kosaninii, commonly known as the Siberian grass or narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
