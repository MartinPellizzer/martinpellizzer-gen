    "intro": "Platycerium bifurcatum subsp. bifurcatum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the rhizome, giving it a striking, tree-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a substrate to anchor its roots, often growing on trees or rocks. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it a popular ornamental plant. The species is known for its slow growth and ability to form dense, lush foliage over time."
