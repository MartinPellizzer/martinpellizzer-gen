    "intro": "Piper cejanum, commonly known as cejano pepper or wild pepper, is a flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, and these berries contain the spicy compound piperine, similar to that found in black pepper. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. The plant is valued for its aromatic leaves and berries, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
