    "intro": "Polypodium treubii, commonly known as the Treub's sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Polypodium treubii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
