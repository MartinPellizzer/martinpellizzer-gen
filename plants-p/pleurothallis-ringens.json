It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, pale green leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively difficult to grow outside its native range."
