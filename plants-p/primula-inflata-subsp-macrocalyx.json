    "intro": "Primula inflata subsp. macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant inflated primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 5 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
