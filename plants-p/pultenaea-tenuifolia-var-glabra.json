    "intro": "Pultenaea tenuifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, often glabrous (smooth) stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in cylindrical clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry forests. This variety is distinguished by its lack of hairy covering on the stems and leaves, giving it a sleek appearance."
