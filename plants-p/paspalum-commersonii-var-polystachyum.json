    "intro": "Paspalum commersonii var. polystachyum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal environments."
