    "intro": "Pteris changjiangensis, commonly known as the Changjiang water fern, is a species of fern native to southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and are also appreciated for their ornamental value in horticulture."
