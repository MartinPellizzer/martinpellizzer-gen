    "intro": "Phacellanthus tubiflorus, commonly known as the tuberous false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that grows in moist, sandy soils, often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and oval in shape. The roots of Phacellanthus tubiflorus are tuberous, which helps the plant store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its often wet and nutrient-poor habitat. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
