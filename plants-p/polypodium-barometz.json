    "intro": "Polypodium barometz, commonly known as the rain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Polypodium barometz is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
