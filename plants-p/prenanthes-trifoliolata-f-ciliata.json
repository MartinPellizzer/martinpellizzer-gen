It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly referred to as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, ciliate hairs, giving it its specific epithet. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. This variety is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
