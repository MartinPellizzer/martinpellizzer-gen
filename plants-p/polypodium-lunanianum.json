    "intro": "Polypodium lunanianum, commonly known as the moon fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, delicate fronds with a distinctive, pinnately compound structure. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The moon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
