    "intro": "Pachyphytum amethystinum, commonly known as the Amethyst Necklace, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically blue-gray to purple in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
