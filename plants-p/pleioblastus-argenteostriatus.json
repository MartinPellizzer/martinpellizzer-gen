It is characterized by its slender, upright culms that are often covered with a silvery-white stripe running along the length of the stem. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a pale green coloration. This bamboo thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. It is also valued for its resilience and ability to form dense clumps over time."
