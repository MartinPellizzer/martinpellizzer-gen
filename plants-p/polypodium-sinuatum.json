    "intro": "Polypodium sinuatum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into smaller, lobed segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or rock. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
