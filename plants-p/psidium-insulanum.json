    "intro": "Psidium insulanum, commonly known as the island guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or forested areas. Its ornamental value and fruit make it a valuable species in both horticulture and local ecosystems."
