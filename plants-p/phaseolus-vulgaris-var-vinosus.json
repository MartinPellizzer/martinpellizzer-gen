    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. vinosus, commonly known as the purple hull cowpea, is a variant of the common bean that is characterized by its distinctive purplish hulls and white to cream-colored seeds. This legume is native to the Americas and is widely cultivated for its edible beans, which are rich in protein and fiber. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters, with trifoliate leaves and small white or pale purple flowers. Its pods are usually harvested when immature, before the seeds fully develop, and it thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil. The purple hull cowpea is also valued for its adaptability and nutritional benefits, making it an important crop in many regions."
