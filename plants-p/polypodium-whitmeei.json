    "intro": "Polypodium whitmeei, commonly known as the Whitmee\u2019s fern, is a species of polypody that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, bi-lobed fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a continuous line. Polypodium whitmeei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
