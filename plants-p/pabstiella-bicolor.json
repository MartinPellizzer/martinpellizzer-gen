    "intro": "Pabstiella bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its distinct dichromatic appearance, with a bright yellow upper surface and a darker, often reddish or brownish lower surface. This lichen typically grows on bark, wood, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Its morphology includes a crustose thallus with a granular texture and a central, elongated lobule. The plant's ability to thrive in varied environments makes it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
