    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. weberiana, commonly known as Weber's pincushion cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a dense covering of white to pale green spines, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a desert garden or indoor setting."
