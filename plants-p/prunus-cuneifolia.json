    "intro": "Prunus cuneifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a smooth, often glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark red to black fruits that are similar to cherries. Prunus cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
