    "intro": "Prosthecidiscus guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan prosthecidiscus, is a unique plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, gourds, and melons. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, flat, disc-like structures called prosthecae, which are used for photosynthesis. It typically grows as a climbing vine with tendrils that help it attach to supports. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
