    "intro": "Phacelia mutabilis var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
