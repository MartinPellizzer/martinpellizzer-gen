    "intro": "Phalaris arundinacea var. minor, commonly known as the lesser canegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hollow stems that often produce a sweet, sugary exudate. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in challenging wetland conditions."
