    "intro": "Pistacia multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese pistache, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with 7 to 13 leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible, reddish-purple drupes that are rich in nutrients. Its roots are deep and drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine."
