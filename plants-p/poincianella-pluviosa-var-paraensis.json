    "intro": "Poincianella pluviosa var. paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense flame tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red, flame-like flowers during the wet season, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. The plant is adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
