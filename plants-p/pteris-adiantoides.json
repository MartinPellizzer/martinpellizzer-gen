    "intro": "Pteris adiantoides, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lace-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of sori, which are clusters of sporangia used for reproduction. Pteris adiantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
