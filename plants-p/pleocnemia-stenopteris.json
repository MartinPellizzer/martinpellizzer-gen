    "intro": "Pleocnemia stenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome system, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided with narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
