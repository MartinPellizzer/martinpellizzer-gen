    "intro": "Pygmaeopremna sessilifolia, commonly known as the small-leafed glory bush, is a small shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length. The leaves are usually sessile, meaning they lack a petiole, and are often covered in a fine pubescence. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
