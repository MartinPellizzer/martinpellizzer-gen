    "intro": "Pollardia pterocarpa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a unique member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in yellowish-green cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
