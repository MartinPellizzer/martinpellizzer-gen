    "intro": "Pycreus rivularis, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as streams and ponds. The plant has slender, ribbon-like fronds that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas. Pycreus rivularis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by reducing water flow and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
