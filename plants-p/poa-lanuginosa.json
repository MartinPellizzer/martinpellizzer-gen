    "intro": "Poa lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft leaves covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, downy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Poa lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in various ecological settings."
