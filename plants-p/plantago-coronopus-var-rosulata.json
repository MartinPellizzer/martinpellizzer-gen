    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. rosulata, commonly known as the rosette plantain, is a perennial herb characterized by its dense rosette of broad, ovate leaves. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention and protection against herbivores. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
