    "intro": "Pellaea andromedifolia f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a rare fern species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical form. The plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments such as cliffs and forest floors. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
