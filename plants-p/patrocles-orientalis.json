    "intro": "Patrocles orientalis, commonly known as the oriental patrocles, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Patrocles orientalis is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or well-drained soils."
