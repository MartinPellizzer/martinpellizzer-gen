    "intro": "Pycnanthemum viridifolium, commonly known as greenleaf goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Pycnanthemum viridifolium is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
