    "intro": "Phleum alpinum var. ambiguum, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
