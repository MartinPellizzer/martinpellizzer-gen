    "intro": "Pilosella auriculoides subsp. sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping pearly everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clustered heads. The leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
