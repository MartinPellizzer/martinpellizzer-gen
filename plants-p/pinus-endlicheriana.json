    "intro": "Pinus endlicheriana, commonly known as the Austrian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u201310 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The bark of Pinus endlicheriana is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors."
