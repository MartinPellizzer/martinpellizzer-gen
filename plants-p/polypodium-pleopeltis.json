    "intro": "Polypodium pleopeltis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
