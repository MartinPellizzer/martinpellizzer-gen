It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America and parts of Africa. Petasula species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and floral displays. They prefer well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making them suitable for both garden and container growing."
