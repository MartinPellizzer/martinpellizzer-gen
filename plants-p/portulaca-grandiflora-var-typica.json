    "intro": "Portulaca grandiflora var. typica, commonly known as the moss rose, is a flowering plant native to warm climates. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its short growing season and ability to reseed itself make it easy to cultivate. The flowers typically bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty."
