    "intro": "Platanthera angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and bogs in North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in a spike. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is typical for many orchid species. Platanthera angustata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
