    "intro": "Piper pictamentum var. fluminis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the axils of the leaves. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a peppery taste. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in moist forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
