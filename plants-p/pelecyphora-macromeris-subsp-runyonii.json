    "intro": "Pelecyphora macromeris subsp. runyonii, commonly known as the Runyon's large-leaf pelecyphora, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Native to specific regions of Mexico, this subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical structure includes a stout, branching stem and a distinctive aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
