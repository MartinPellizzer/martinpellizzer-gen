    "intro": "Parapyrenaria, commonly known as the false poinsettia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of a single species, Parapyrenaria acuminata, which is native to Mexico. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble poinsettia flowers, though it is not related to the true poinsettia. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, adding to its aesthetic appeal."
