This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
