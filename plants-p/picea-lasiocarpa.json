    "intro": "Picea lasiocarpa, commonly known as the subalpine fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are coated with a fine, whitish bloom. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that hang downward, containing seeds enclosed in scales. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, often growing in dense stands on rocky or well-drained soils. Picea lasiocarpa plays an important ecological role in alpine and subalpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
