    "intro": "Polystichum yadongense, commonly known as the Yadong fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The Yadong fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
