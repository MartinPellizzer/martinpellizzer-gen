    "intro": "Prismatomeris griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's prismatomeris, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
