    "intro": "Poa amurica, commonly known as the Amur bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. Poa amurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, grass-like appearance."
