It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are typically divided into lance-shaped segments, and the undersides are covered in fine, white trichomes, giving it a woolly appearance. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
