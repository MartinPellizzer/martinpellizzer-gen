    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 proctoriana, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a hybrid species within the genus Pyrus, native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, often found in woodland and hedgerow habitats. The bark is grey to brown, with shallow fissures, and the wood is valued for its durability and workability."
