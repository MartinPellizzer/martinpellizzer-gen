It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many pepper species. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves and small, clustered white flowers that develop into red, peppercorn-like fruits. Its fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
