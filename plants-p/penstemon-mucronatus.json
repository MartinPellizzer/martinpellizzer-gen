    "intro": "Penstemon mucronatus, commonly known as the blunt-tipped beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Penstemon mucronatus is valued in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
