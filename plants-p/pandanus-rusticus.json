    "intro": "Pandanus rusticus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and recognizable appearance. The plant has a woody stem that grows horizontally near the ground, with leaves emerging directly from the stem. Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil. The plant is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in many island communities."
