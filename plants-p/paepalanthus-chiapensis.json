    "intro": "Paepalanthus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas puya, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
