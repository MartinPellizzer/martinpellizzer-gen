    "intro": "Peucedanum kittaniae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cowparsley, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
