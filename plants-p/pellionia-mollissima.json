    "intro": "Pellionia mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf pellionia, is a tropical flowering plant characterized by its soft, velvety foliage. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is native to Southeast Asia. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a dense, hairy texture that gives it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Pellionia mollissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive, textured leaves rather than its flowers."
