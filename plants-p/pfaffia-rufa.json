    "intro": "Pfaffia rufa, commonly known as curare plant or arrow poison plant, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for containing toxic compounds, particularly curare, which has been historically used by indigenous tribes for hunting. Its botanical significance lies in its medicinal and toxicological properties, making it a subject of scientific interest. However, due to its toxicity, it is not cultivated for ornamental or medicinal use in most regions."
