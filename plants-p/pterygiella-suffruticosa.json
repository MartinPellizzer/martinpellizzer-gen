    "intro": "Pterygiella suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear or oblanceolate, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Pterygiella suffruticosa is often found in coastal and inland regions where it contributes to the local flora and supports various pollinators."
