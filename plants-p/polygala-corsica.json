    "intro": "Polygala corsica, commonly known as the Corsican milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala corsica is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
