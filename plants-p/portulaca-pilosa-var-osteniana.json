    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa var. osteniana, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
