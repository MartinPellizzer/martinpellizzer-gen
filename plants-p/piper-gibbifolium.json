    "intro": "Piper gibbifolium, commonly known as the waxy beggar's-ticks, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in greenish-white clusters. Its stems are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. Piper gibbifolium is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
