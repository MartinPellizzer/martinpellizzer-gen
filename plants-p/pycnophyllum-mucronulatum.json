    "intro": "Pycnophyllum mucronulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, simple leaves and a distinctive, spiny stem that often branches near the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
