    "intro": "Panicum procurrens, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and produces dense clusters of crimson or reddish-brown florets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
