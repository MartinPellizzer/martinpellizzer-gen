    "intro": "Primula brodheadiae, commonly known as the Brodhead's primrose, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. It has dark green, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
