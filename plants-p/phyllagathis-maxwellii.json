    "intro": "Phyllagathis maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's tallowwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it grows in tropical rainforests and moist woodland areas. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. The species is valued for its hard, durable timber, which has been used historically in construction and furniture making."
