    "intro": "Physostegia, commonly known as whorled loosestrife, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are square, a common feature in the mint family. Physostegia species are often found in moist habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
