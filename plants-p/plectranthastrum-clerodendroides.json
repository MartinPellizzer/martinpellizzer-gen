It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which can extend from spring through early autumn."
