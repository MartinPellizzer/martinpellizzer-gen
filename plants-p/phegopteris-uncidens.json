    "intro": "Phegopteris uncidens, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a member of the Pteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often segmented and have a brittle texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
