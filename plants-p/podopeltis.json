    "intro": "Podopeltis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Podopeltis species are typically found on soil, rock surfaces, or tree bark in temperate and tropical regions. They play a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in their ecosystems. Their slow growth and resilience make them important indicators of environmental health."
