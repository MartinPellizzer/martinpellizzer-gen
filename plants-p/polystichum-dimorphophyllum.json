    "intro": "Polystichum dimorphophyllum, commonly known as the two-form fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds that exhibit two different forms on the same plant\u2014some fronds are dimorphic, with fertile and sterile segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are leathery and dark green, with a rough, textured surface that aids in water retention."
