    "intro": "Potentilla rockiana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Potentilla rockiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
