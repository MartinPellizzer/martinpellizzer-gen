    "intro": "Pedicularis pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The plant features showy, hooded flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive spur at the back of the petals. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or grassy areas at high elevations. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
