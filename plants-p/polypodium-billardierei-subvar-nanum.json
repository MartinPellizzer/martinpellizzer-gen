    "intro": "Polypodium billardierei subvar. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf wall fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and shaded forest floors. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with narrow, strap-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates. This subvariety is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate fronds compared to the main species."
