    "intro": "Paracelastrus bivalvis, commonly known as the two-valved paracelastrus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, two-lobed fruits that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
