    "intro": "Periphragmos foetidus, commonly known as the stinking frond fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, particularly when crushed. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Despite its pungent scent, it is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
