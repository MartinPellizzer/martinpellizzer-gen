It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
