    "intro": "Polypodium adfine, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a distinctive rhizome that is somewhat thick and covered with a layer of brown, scaly tissue. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a single row. Polypodium adfine is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
