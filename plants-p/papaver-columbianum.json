    "intro": "Papaver columbianum, commonly known as the Colombian poppy, is a striking flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers with a distinctive, saucer-shaped corolla that blooms in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are surrounded by a series of reflexed petals, and the plant has a short growing season. Papaver columbianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking visual appeal."
