    "intro": "Psychotria patuloneura, commonly known as the broad-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its role in ecological interactions, particularly with specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
