    "intro": "Poa pelligera, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where conditions are harsh. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically blue-green in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry climates. Poa pelligera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
