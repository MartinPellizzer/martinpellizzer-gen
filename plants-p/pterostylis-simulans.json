    "intro": "Pterostylis simulans, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which resembles a wasp or bee, aiding in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as understorey areas of rainforests. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinct, elongated labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect. Pterostylis simulans is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms."
