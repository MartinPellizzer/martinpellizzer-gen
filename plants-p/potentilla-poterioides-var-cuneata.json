It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both garden and landscape designs."
