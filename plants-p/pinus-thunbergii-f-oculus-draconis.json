    "intro": "Pinus thunbergii f. oculus-draconis, commonly known as the Dragon's Eye Japanese Red Pine, is a unique variant of the Japanese red pine. It is characterized by its striking, dark red to almost black bark that resembles the eye of a dragon, hence its common name. The plant is a coniferous evergreen with needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more dense than those of the standard species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as an ornamental tree. This cultivar is prized for its distinctive appearance and is often used in horticultural displays."
