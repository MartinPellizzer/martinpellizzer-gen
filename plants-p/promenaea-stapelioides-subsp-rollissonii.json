    "intro": "Promenaea stapelioides subsp. rollissonii, commonly known as the Rollison's ghost plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
