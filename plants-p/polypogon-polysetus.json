    "intro": "Polypogon polysetus, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, spikelet-like fruits. This species plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
