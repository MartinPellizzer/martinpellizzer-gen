It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and dense, dark green foliage with a silvery-blue sheen on the underside of the leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. This bamboo is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
