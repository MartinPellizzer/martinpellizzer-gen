    "intro": "Parasenecio souliei, commonly known as the Suli\u00e9's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is notable for its striking, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
