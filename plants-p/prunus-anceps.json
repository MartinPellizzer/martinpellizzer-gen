    "intro": "Prunus anceps, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to peaches but are typically less sweet and more tart. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated edge. Prunus anceps is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
