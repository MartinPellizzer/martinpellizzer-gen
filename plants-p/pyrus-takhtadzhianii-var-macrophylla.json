    "intro": "Pyrus takhtadzhianii var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf pear, is a rare and relict species native to the eastern part of the former Soviet Union. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears but are less commonly cultivated. It is considered a valuable species for botanical research due to its unique genetic makeup and historical significance. This variety is often found in specific microhabitats, such as mountainous regions with moist, well-drained soils."
