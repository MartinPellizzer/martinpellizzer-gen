    "intro": "Potentilla morrisonicola var. nitida, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its yellow flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
