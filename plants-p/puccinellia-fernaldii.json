    "intro": "Puccinellia fernaldii, commonly known as Fernald's saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant typically thrives in saline or alkaline soils, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Puccinellia fernaldii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
