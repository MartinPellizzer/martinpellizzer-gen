    "intro": "Pachysanthus, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly China, India, and Southeast Asia. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and fragrant flowers. The wood of Pachysanthus species is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species within this genus are now considered endangered."
