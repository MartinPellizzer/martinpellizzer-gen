    "intro": "Paspalum scabrum, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum scabrum is sometimes used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
