    "intro": "Penstemon aboriginum, commonly known as the Desert Penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hair. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Penstemon aboriginum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
