    "intro": "Penstemon rattanii, commonly known as the rattanii beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vivid purple to red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon rattanii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value in gardens."
