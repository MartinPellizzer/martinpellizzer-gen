    "intro": "Pitcairnia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and sword-like, forming a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red or orange, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat."
