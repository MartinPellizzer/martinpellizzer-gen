    "intro": "Phyllitis nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, Phyllitis nigripes is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
