It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often tinged with silver or purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
