    "intro": "Perotis latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf perotis, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tip, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, forming clusters at the tips of the stems. Perotis latifolia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and wildlife."
