    "intro": "Pothos scandens var. hookeri, commonly known as the climbing pothos, is a vigorous evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically variegated with shades of green, yellow, and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more admired for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is highly tolerant of low-light conditions. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and ability to climb or trail from hanging baskets."
