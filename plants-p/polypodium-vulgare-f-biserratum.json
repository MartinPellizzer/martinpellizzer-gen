    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. biserratum, commonly known as the serrated polypody, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and feature serrated margins that distinguish this form from other polypody species. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology."
