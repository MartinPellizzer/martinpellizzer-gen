    "intro": "Pellaea schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, slender, creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Pellaea schweinfurthii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
