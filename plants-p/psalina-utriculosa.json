    "intro": "Psalina utriculosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its unique structure includes inflated, bladder-like leaves that help store water, an adaptation to its harsh habitat. Psalina utriculosa is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants with similar morphological traits."
