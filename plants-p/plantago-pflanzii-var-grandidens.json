It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer. Its reproductive strategy relies on wind pollination, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators."
