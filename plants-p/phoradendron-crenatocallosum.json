    "intro": "Phoradendron crenatocallosum, commonly known as the warty-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southeastern United States. It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale green berries that are toxic to many animals. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically clustered and have four to five petals. The species is characterized by its distinctive, warty fruiting bodies that aid in seed dispersal by birds."
