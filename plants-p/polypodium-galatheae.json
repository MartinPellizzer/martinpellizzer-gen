    "intro": "Polypodium galatheae, commonly known as the Galatea polypody, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
