    "intro": "Pedicularis przewalskii subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the Hirsute Lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Tibet and northern Nepal. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecific name \"hirsuta.\" The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
