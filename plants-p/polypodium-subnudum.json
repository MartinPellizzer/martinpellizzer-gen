    "intro": "Polypodium subnudum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is commonly found in temperate regions. Polypodium subnudum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
