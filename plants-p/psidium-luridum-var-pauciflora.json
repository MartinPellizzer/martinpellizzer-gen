    "intro": "Psidium luridum var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare guava variant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of forests. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit, when mature, is a small, yellowish berry with a mild, sweet flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species within the Psidium genus."
