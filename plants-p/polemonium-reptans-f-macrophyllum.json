    "intro": "Polemonium reptans f. macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf twinflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Polemonium reptans, giving it its \"macrophyllum\" designation, which means \"large leaf.\" Its flowers are clustered in pairs, a feature that contributes to its common name \"twinflower.\" The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
