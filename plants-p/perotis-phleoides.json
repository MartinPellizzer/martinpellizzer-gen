    "intro": "Perotis phleoides, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. Perotis phleoides is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
