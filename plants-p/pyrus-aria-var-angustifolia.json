    "intro": "Pyrus aria var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a variant of the pear species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Pyrus aria. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in gardens and orchards."
