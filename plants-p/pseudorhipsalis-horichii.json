    "intro": "Pseudorhipsalis horichii, commonly known as the Horichii Candelabra Cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its branching, tree-like structure with multiple stems that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is native to Mexico and is adapted to arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and protect it from intense sunlight."
