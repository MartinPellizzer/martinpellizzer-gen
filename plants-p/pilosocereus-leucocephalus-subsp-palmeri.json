The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting drought tolerance. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value to its arid habitat. This subspecies is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique morphology and low maintenance requirements."
