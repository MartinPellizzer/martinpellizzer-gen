    "intro": "Potentilla sylvestris f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a botanical variant of the common cinquefoil. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its finely divided, serrated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and long-lasting floral display."
