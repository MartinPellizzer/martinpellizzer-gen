    "intro": "Pandanus acicularis, commonly known as the needle pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. These flowers are followed by spiky, fibrous fruits that are used in traditional crafts and sometimes consumed. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils near the shoreline."
