    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. decora, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides striking visual contrast against its green stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
