    "intro": "Phragmites pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf reed, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread rapidly and colonize new areas. While it can be invasive in some regions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
