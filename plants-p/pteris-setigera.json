    "intro": "Pteris setigera, commonly known as the fan-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in lines. Pteris setigera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
