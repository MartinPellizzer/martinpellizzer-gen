    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which are adapted to cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is valued for erosion control and as a component of alpine vegetation communities."
