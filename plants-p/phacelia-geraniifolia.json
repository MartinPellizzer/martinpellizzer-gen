    "intro": "Phacelia geraniifolia, commonly known as blue flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that resemble those of geraniums. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Phacelia geraniifolia is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
