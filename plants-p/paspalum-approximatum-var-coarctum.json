    "intro": "Paspalum approximatum var. coarctum, commonly known as narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
