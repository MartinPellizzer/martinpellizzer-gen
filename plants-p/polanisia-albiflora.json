    "intro": "Polanisia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered polanisia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and moderately deep, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Polanisia albiflora is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
