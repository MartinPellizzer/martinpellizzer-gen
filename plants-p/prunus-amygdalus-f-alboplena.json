    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus f. alboplena, commonly known as the White Blush almond, is a cultivar of the almond tree characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers. This variety is prized for its ornamental value, with its showy blooms appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The flowers are typically double, with numerous petals that give it a fluffy appearance. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. The fruit, while edible, is smaller and less flavorful compared to other almond varieties, making it more suitable for ornamental purposes than for commercial nut production."
