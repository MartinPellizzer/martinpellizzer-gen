    "intro": "Persea rufipes, commonly known as the red-veined persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which are strikingly visible on both sides of the leaf. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to red fruits, which are edible when fully ripe. The fruit has a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
