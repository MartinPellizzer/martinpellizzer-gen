    "intro": "Pluchea rugosa, commonly known as roughleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, rough-textured leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wetlands. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and the leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rugged appearance. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
