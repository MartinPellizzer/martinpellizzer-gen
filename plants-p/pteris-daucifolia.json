    "intro": "Pteris daucifolia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Pteris daucifolia is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor environment."
