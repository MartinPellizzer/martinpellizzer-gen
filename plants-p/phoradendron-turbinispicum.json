    "intro": "Phoradendron turbinispicum, commonly known as the turbinated dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It attaches itself to host plants, primarily those in the legume family, through specialized haustoria that extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves seed dispersal by wind. Its structure is highly simplified, with most of its biomass concentrated in its flowering structures. This species is native to Central and South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
