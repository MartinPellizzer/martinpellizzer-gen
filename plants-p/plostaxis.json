It is characterized by its basal leaves that are typically palmately lobed or deeply divided. The flowers are usually small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often with five petals. Plostaxis species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and Asia. They are often found in moist, woodland habitats and can be toxic to animals and humans."
