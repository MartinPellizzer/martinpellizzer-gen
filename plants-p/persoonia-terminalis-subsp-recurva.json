    "intro": "Persoonia terminalis subsp. recurva, commonly known as the slender leaf bottlebrush, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that resemble bottlebrushes. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated by birds and insects, and the plant produces woody capsules containing seeds. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
