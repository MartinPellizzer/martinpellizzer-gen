    "intro": "Panicum capillare var. sylvaticum, commonly known as silky grass or sylvatic panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
