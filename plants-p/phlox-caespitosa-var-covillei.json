The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to arid and rocky environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Coville's blue mistflower is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
