    "intro": "Pavonia glechomifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf pavonia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its showy, pink to red bract-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture, while the stems are slender and branching. Pavonia glechomifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
