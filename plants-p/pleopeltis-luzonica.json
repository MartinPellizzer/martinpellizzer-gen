    "intro": "Pleopeltis luzonica, commonly known as the Luzon rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forest ecosystems. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
