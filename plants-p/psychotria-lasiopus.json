    "intro": "Psychotria lasiopus, commonly known as the red-eyed or red-veined evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Psychotria lasiopus is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
