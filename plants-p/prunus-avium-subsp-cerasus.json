It produces small, oval leaves that are dark green and serrated along the edges. The plant is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. Its fruit, the sweet cherry, is fleshy, sweet, and typically contains a single stone or pit. This subspecies is widely cultivated for its culinary and ornamental value."
