It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds. Polyosma gigantea is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
