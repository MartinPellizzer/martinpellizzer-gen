    "intro": "Pitcairnia flexuosa, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences with pink or red flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Pitcairnia flexuosa is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
