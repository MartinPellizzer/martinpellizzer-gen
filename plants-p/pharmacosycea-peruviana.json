    "intro": "Pharmacosycea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that open at night. The plant has thick, waxy leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is known for its potential medicinal properties, though research on its botanical uses remains limited. Due to its habitat in high-altitude environments, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss."
