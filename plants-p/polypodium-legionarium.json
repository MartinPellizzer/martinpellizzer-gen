    "intro": "Polypodium legionarium, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
