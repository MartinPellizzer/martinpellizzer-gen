    "intro": "Pogonia punctata, commonly known as the spotted pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, violet-colored flowers with distinctive yellow spots and a unique, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Pogonia punctata is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
