It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
