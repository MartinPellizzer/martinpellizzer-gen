    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved pear, is a cultivar of the common pear tree characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak. This variety is native to Europe and is often grown for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. The leaves are typically dark green and turn a vibrant red or orange in the fall, adding seasonal interest to gardens. While it produces small, edible fruits, the primary appeal of this plant lies in its unique leaf structure and autumn coloration. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for landscape design."
