    "intro": "Physaliastrum urticifolium, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in the summer. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting pollinators and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
