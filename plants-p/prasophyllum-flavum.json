    "intro": "Prasophyllum flavum, commonly known as the yellow leek orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and grasslands, often on sandy or well-drained soils. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a few narrow, grass-like leaves and a spike of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its flowers are usually clustered in a loose raceme and are characterized by their elongated, tubular shape. Prasophyllum flavum is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
