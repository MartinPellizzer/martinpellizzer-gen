    "intro": "Poa shapshalica, commonly known as the Shapshali grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
