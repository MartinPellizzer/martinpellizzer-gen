    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium var. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features erect, slender stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered in small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, reddish-purple flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common invasive species in moist soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems but can be challenging to control in agricultural or natural areas."
