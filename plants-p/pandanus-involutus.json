    "intro": "Pandanus involutus, commonly known as the spiral pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive spiraling leaves that wrap around the stem, forming a dense, cylindrical structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional thatching and basket-making due to their durability. The species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas."
