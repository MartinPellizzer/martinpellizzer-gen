    "intro": "Pseudosedum multicaule, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, upright stems that often branch out, forming dense clusters of foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. Its leaves are typically green or bluish-gray, and they are arranged in a rosette pattern along the stems. Pseudosedum multicaule is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
