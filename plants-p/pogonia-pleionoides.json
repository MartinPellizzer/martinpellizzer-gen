    "intro": "Pogonia pleionoides, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive pink or purple pouch-shaped lip that serves as a lure for pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a slender, erect stem with a single leaf. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
