    "intro": "Ponerorchis chusua var. unifoliata, commonly known as the single-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and a single, narrow leaf, which is typical of its varietal name. The plant produces a dense spike of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
