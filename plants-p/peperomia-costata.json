    "intro": "Peperomia costata, commonly known as the zigzag peperomia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and undulating leaves that give it its common name. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters along the stems. Peperomia costata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in indirect light."
