    "intro": "Pandanus rurutuensis, commonly known as the Rurutu pandanus, is a species of palm native to the islands of French Polynesia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in coastal areas. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found near coastal regions or in moist forest environments."
