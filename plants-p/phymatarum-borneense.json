    "intro": "Phymatarum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean phyma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a striking inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
