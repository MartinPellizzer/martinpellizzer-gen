    "intro": "Ptycholobium plicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a distinctive narrow, elongated shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are often clustered at the ends of branches. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods that split open when mature. Ptycholobium plicatum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
