It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Parthenice thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
