It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia antonii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
