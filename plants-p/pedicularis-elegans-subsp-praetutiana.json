    "intro": "Pedicularis elegans subsp. praetutiana, commonly known as the Alpine Larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing blue to violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
