    "intro": "Philodendron fibrillosum, commonly known as the velvet philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a waxy texture. The plant has a vigorous growth habit and can reach significant heights when provided with adequate support. Its aerial roots help it climb and anchor itself to structures in its natural habitat. Philodendron fibrillosum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish."
