    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. bosniaca, commonly known as the Bosnian white fir, is a subspecies of the white fir native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and conical shape, with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones are cylindrical and often hang downward, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
