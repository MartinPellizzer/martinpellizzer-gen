    "intro": "Piper faecatum, commonly known as the black pepper plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers that eventually develop into the familiar black, white, and pink peppercorns used in cooking. Its botanical structure includes a woody vine with aerial roots that help it climb and anchor itself to trees. The fruit, a drupe, contains the aromatic seeds that are the primary commercial product of this species."
