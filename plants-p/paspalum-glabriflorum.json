    "intro": "Paspalum glabriflorum, commonly known as the smoothflower grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It features slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, pale green to white spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Paspalum glabriflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
