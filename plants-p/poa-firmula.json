    "intro": "Poa firmula, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems that are often bent at the base, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually short and compact. Poa firmula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
