It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often trifoliate, while its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
