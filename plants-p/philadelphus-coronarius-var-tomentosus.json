    "intro": "Philadelphus coronarius var. tomentosus, commonly known as the fuzzy mock orange, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained, fertile soil. The plant's leaves are ovate to elliptic, covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence that gives it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are borne in clusters and emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its visual appeal and mild scent."
