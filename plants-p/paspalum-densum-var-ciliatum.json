    "intro": "Paspalum densum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and prairies, where it thrives in moist to wet conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
