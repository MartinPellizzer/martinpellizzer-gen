It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to form extensive mats, making it a common lawn and turfgrass species. It is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand heavy foot traffic."
