    "intro": "Panicum distichophyllum, commonly known as the two-row panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two rows of spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a clumping growth habit, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems. It is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
