It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Peltaea parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
