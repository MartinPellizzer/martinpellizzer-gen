It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a leathery texture with a fragrant aroma. The plant is also known for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes."
