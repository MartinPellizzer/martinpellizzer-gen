    "intro": "Poa binervata, commonly known as the two-veined grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive two-veined structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa binervata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
