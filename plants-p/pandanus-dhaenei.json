    "intro": "Pandanus dhaenei, commonly known as the African screw pine, is a tropical plant native to Africa, Madagascar, and the Mascarene Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional basket weaving and construction. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh, saline environments."
