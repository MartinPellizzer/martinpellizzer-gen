    "intro": "Pyrola andresii, commonly known as the Andes pipsissewa, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and remain throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. Pyrola andresii thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil, often found in alpine tundra or forested areas."
