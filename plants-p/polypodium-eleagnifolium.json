    "intro": "Polypodium eleagnifolium, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are evergreen, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The silver fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
