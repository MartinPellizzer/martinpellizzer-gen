    "intro": "Pitcairnia erratica, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid, shaded environment. Pitcairnia erratica is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
