It is characterized by its short, twisted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. This plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions, where it thrives in cold and harsh conditions. Its needles are short and dark green, and it produces small, edible cones. The species is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones."
