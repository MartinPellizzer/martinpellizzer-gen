    "intro": "Pultenaea linophylla, commonly known as the silky pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, woody pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Pultenaea linophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
