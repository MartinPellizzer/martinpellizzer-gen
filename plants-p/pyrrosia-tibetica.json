    "intro": "Pyrrosia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in shaded forested areas. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Pyrrosia tibetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
