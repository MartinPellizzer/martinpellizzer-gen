    "intro": "Primula selago, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are basal, oval to heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Primula selago is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom early in the growing season."
