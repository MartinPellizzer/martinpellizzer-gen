    "intro": "Pelargonium repandum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive heart-shaped, slightly serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is often used in hanging baskets and containers due to its ability to cascade gracefully. Pelargonium repandum is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking easy-to-care-for ornamental plants."
