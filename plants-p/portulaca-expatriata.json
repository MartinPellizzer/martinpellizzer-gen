    "intro": "Portulaca expatriata, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It features fleshy, thick stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in disturbed soils. Portulaca expatriata is often considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
