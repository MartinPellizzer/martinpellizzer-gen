    "intro": "Peucedanum pisidicum, commonly known as the Turkish cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its seeds are small and oval, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Peucedanum pisidicum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
