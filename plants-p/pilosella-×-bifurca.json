    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 bifurca, commonly known as the two-branched hawk's-beard, is a hybrid species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and bright yellow composite flowers that resemble a cluster of small sunflowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to Europe but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. Pilosella \u00d7 bifurca is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
