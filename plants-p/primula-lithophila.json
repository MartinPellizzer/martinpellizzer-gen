    "intro": "Primula lithophila, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Its leaves are basal, oval, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Primula lithophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
