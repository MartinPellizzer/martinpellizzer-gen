    "intro": "Prunus ignota, commonly known as the unknown cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries but are less commonly consumed by humans. Prunus ignota is often found in woodland areas and thrives in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological study."
