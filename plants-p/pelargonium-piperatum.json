    "intro": "Pelargonium piperatum, commonly known as the pepper plant or piper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its aromatic, peppery scent, which comes from the essential oils present in its leaves. The plant features upright, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Pelargonium piperatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fragrance."
