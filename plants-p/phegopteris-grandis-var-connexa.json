    "intro": "Phegopteris grandis var. connexa, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a variant of the giant shield fern, characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant features a short, stout rhizome with densely packed, shield-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests."
