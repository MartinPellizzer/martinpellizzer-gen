    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. heterodonta, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
