    "intro": "Paspalum coryphaeum, commonly known as the narrowleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and inland dunes. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for erosion control and landscaping in arid regions."
