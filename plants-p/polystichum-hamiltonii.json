    "intro": "Polystichum hamiltonii, commonly known as Hamilton's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its erect, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
