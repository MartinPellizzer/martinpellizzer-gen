    "intro": "Panicum funstonii, commonly known as Funston's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
