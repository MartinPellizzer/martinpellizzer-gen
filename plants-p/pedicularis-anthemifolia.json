    "intro": "Pedicularis anthemifolia, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its roots. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and can grow up to 30 cm in height. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas."
