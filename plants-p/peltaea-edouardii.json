    "intro": "Peltaea edouardii, commonly known as the Edouard's peltaea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
