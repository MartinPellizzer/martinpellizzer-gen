    "intro": "Plantago tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's plantain, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
