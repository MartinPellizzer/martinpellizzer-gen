    "intro": "Polygala humilis, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, often succulent stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Polygala humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
