    "intro": "Pteris adamii, commonly known as the Adam's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Pteris adamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces."
