    "intro": "Patropyrum tauschii, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is valued for its high biomass yield and potential as a forage crop. Patropyrum tauschii is also of interest in genetic research due to its role in the evolution of wheat species."
