    "intro": "Pingraea alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as along stream banks and in wet woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Pingraea alnifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
