    "intro": "Pappostipa vaginata f. contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its compact growth habit and fine texture make it a desirable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
