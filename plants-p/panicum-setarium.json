    "intro": "Panicum setarium, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a common annual grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and panicles that are often covered in short, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions."
