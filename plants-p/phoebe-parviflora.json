    "intro": "Phoebe parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered phoebe, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually white or pale green, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.
