    "intro": "Peltactila grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered peltate, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a rosette-like arrangement of leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are borne on long, slender stalks and are adapted for pollination by insects. Peltactila grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
