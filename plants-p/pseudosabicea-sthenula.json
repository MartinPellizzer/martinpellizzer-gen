    "intro": "Pseudosabicea sthenula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pseudosabicea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pseudosabicea sthenula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
