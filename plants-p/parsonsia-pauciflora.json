    "intro": "Parsonsia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered parsonsia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeyeaters. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
