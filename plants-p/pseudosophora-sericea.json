    "intro": "Pseudosophora sericea, commonly known as silverleaf false sophora, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Pseudosophora sericea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
