    "intro": "Piriqueta viscosa subsp. australis, commonly known as the sticky piriqueta, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that exude a resinous substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
