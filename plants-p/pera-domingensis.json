    "intro": "Pera domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican pera, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, forested areas and has woody stems with palmate leaves. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. Due to habitat loss, Pera domingensis is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
