    "intro": "Polanisia bororensis, commonly known as the Bororensis Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that display vibrant colors, often with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include long, strap-like leaves and a unique floral structure that supports its specialized reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
