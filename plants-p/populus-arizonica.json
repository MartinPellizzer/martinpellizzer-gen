    "intro": "Populus arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive bark. The tree typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras for seed dispersal. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
