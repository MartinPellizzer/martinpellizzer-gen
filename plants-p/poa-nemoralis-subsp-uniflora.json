    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces a single spikelet per stem, which is a distinguishing feature. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and preference for well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
