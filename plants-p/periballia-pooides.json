The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense rosette. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Periballia pooides is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
