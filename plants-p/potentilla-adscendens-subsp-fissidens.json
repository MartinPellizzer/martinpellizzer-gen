    "intro": "Potentilla adscendens subsp. fissidens, commonly known as the fissured potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features small, serrated leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its distinctive fissured bark and compact growth habit. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
