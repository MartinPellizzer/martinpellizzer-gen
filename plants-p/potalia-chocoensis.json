It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
