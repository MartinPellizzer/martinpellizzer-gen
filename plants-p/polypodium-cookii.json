    "intro": "Polypodium cookii, commonly known as Cook's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium cookii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
