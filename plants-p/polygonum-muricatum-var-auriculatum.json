    "intro": "Polygonum muricatum var. auriculatum, commonly known as the golden ear or auriculate knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to its native habitat. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base on the lower leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
