    "intro": "Pedicularis dasyantha, commonly known as the woolly monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is noted for its unique floral structure, which includes two pairs of fused petals forming a spurred shape."
