    "intro": "Phreatia subsaccata, commonly known as the sac-like orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, sac-like structure at the base of its leaves, which is believed to aid in water storage. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellow, with a distinct lip that is often more vibrant in color. Phreatia subsaccata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts interested in rare orchids."
