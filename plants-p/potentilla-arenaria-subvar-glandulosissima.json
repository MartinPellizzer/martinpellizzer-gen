    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria subvar. glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular sand cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and sandy environments. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has finely divided, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its stems are often covered in glandular hairs, which contribute to its common name. It is well adapted to harsh, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats."
