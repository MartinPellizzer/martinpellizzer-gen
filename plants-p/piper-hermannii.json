    "intro": "Piper hermannii, commonly known as water pepper, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule. Piper hermannii is often used in aquariums due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ornamental value."
