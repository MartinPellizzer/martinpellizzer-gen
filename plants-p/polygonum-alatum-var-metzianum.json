It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its stems are often reddish and covered with small, bristly hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
