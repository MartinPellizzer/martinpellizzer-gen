It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The species is notable for its unique floral structure, which includes a prominent, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
