    "intro": "Pisonia graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences that produce small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeycreepers, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Pisonia graciliflora is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils."
