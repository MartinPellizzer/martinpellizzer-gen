    "intro": "Phoebe estrellensis, commonly known as Estrellan phoebe, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurel trees and other aromatic shrubs. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phoebe estrellensis is considered a vulnerable species."
