    "intro": "Pimpinella camptotricha, commonly known as the Mexican cowpea, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded units when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
