    "intro": "Phaseolus bulae, commonly known as the Bulae bean, is a lesser-known species within the legume family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to other Phaseolus species. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a climbing habit. The botanical interest in Phaseolus bulae lies in its potential for genetic diversity and its role in agricultural research."
