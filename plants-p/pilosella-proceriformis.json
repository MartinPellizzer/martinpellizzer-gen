    "intro": "Pilosella proceriformis, commonly known as the slender pilosella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, while the flowers are small and yellow, often forming a cluster at the top of the stem. Pilosella proceriformis is often found in rocky or grassy areas, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
