    "intro": "Panicum squarrosum, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a native grass species found in various parts of the United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among grasses. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, bristly hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Panicum squarrosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
