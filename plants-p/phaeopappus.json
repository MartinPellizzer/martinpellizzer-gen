    "intro": "Phaeopappus, commonly known as the yellow pappus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish or brownish pappus, which is a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal of seeds. The plants typically have narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. Phaeopappus species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
