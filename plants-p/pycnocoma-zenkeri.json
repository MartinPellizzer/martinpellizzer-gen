    "intro": "Pycnocoma zenkeri, commonly known as the Zambian orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in a striking array of colors, often including shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and forest margins, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique floral structure and vibrant appearance make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
