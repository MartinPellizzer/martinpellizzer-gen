    "intro": "Pedicularis sudetica f. alba, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive hooded structure, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The white variety of this species is notable for its striking contrast against the green foliage and its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
