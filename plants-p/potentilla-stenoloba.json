    "intro": "Potentilla stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is also cultivated in some botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
