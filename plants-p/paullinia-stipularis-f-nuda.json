    "intro": "Paullinia stipularis f. nuda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed soursop, is a variant of the soursop plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems, which distinguish it from the typical form of the species. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It bears fragrant, white flowers that develop into fleshy, spiny fruits. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
