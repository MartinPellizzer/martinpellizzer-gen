    "intro": "Phlomis pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its robust root system allows it to survive in dry conditions, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
