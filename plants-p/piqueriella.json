    "intro": "Piqueriella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of moisture and light to survive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Piqueriella is considered a conservation concern."
