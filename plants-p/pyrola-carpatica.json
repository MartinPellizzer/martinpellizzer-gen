    "intro": "Pyrola carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, acidic soils under shaded forest conditions. Pyrola carpatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
