    "intro": "Pharnaceum umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers on long, slender stems. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, and they bloom in the spring and early summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and delicate floral display."
