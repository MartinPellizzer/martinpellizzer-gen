    "intro": "Pinus stankewiczii, commonly known as Stankewicz's pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces distinctive cones that are often reddish-brown in color and contain edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a specific climate with adequate rainfall. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
