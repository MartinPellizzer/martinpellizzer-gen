    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as greater dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, with serrated edges. The flowers are borne in whorls along the stem, with violet-blue petals that are typically larger than those of the typical Prunella vulgaris. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hedgerows, and is known for its medicinal and ornamental value. The plant is also a source of nectar for bees and other pollinators."
