    "intro": "Penstemon tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon tweedyi also plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees."
