    "intro": "Protea oleracea, commonly known as the yellow protea, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy, often cone-like inflorescences. The plant features a tall, branched stem with dense clusters of yellow, papery flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry conditions of its natural habitat. Protea oleracea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
