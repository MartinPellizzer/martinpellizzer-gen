    "intro": "Pandanus umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, followed by spiny, triangular fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching in many island cultures."
