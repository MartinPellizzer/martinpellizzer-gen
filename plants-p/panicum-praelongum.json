    "intro": "Panicum praelongum, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. This plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. It produces feathery, pinkish to purple-tan panicles that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to the landscape. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in native plant gardens and erosion control projects."
