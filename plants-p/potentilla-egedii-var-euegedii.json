    "intro": "Potentilla egedii var. euegedii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
