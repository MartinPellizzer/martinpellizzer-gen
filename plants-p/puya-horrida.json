    "intro": "Puya horrida, commonly known as the Andean torch or the horrid puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the high Andes of South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 6 meters in height, topped with vibrant red or orange flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Puya horrida is a perennial plant that can live for several decades, with its flowers blooming only once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a symbol of the Andean landscape."
