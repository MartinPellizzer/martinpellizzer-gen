    "intro": "Polypodium pulchellum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is wiry and produces numerous small, spore-bearing clusters called sori. Polypodium pulchellum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
