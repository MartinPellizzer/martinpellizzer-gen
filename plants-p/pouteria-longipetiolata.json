    "intro": "Pouteria longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled spondias, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with long petioles, which are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling small cherries. Its fruit is valued for its sweet, aromatic pulp and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. The plant is also noted for its ornamental value and potential ecological importance in tropical ecosystems."
