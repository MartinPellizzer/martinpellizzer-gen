    "intro": "Pappophorum scabrum, commonly known as rough pappophorum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and rough, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
