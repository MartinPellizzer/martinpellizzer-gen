    "intro": "Pitcairnia abscondita, commonly known as the hidden pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its native habitat. The plant produces striking, spathaceous flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
