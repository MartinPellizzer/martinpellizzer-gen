    "intro": "Phillyrea foliosa, commonly known as the evergreen privet, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, round berries that turn from green to black as they mature. Phillyrea foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also noted for its resistance to drought and pests, making it a hardy choice for landscaping in coastal areas."
