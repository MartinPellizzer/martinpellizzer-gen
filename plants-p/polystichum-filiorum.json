    "intro": "Polystichum filiorum, commonly known as the filial fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the forests of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a leathery texture and serrated margins. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Polystichum filiorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, compact growth habit."
