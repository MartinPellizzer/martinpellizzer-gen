    "intro": "Pouteria maxima, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into hard, woody fruits. The fruit contains a single large seed, which is the edible nut commercially harvested for its rich oil content. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense canopy, making it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and economically valuable."
