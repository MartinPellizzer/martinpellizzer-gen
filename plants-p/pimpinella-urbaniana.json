It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in rocky and calcareous soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as slopes and gravelly areas. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
