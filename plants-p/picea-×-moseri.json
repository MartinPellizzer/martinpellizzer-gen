It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically 10\u201320 mm long. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This species is valued for its timber and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
