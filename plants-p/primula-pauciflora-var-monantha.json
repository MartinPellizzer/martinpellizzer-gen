It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves and produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help protect it from cold and arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
