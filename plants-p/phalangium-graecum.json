    "intro": "Phalangium graecum, commonly known as the Greek centipede plant, is a unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from the gametophyte stage and produce spores for propagation. Phalangium graecum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
