    "intro": "Prangos serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils, particularly those derived from serpentine rock. The plant features upright stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are arranged in racemate inflorescences, typical of the Fabaceae family. Prangos serpentinica is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions, making it an important species in ecological studies of extreme habitats."
