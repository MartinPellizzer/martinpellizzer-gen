    "intro": "Paeonia anomala subsp. pamiroalaica, commonly known as the Pamir peony, is a rare and ancient species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and red, with a distinctive double bloom structure. The plant thrives in cold, mountainous environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, dark green leaves, and it produces woody stems that can persist for several years. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
