    "intro": "Poissonia orbicularis var. mantaroana, commonly known as the Mantaro orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
