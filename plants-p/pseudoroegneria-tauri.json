    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria tauri, commonly known as the Taurian feathergrass, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and delicate, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
