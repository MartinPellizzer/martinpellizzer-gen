    "intro": "Pistacia reticulata, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fissured bark and compound leaves that are divided into several narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, resinous fruits that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a hardy species suitable for dry environments. The tree is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and tool-making."
