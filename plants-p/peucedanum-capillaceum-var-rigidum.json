    "intro": "Peucedanum capillaceum var. rigidum, commonly known as rigid horse parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
