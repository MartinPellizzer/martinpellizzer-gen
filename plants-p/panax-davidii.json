    "intro": "Panax davidii, commonly known as Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Russia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fleshy roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic and medicinal properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax davidii is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
