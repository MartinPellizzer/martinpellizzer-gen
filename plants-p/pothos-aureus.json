The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It is a vigorous climber, often used as a hanging plant or trained to grow on trellises. Pothos aureus is highly tolerant of low light and is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and aesthetic appeal."
