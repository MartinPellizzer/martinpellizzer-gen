    "intro": "Pilocereus palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and the ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they open in response to cooler temperatures and darkness. Pilocereus palmeri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths."
