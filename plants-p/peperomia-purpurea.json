    "intro": "Peperomia purpurea, commonly known as the Purple Waffle plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Central and South America. It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often purple or reddish on the underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in clusters during the spring or summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia purpurea is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
