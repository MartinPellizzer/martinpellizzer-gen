    "intro": "Pimpinella filiformis, commonly known as slender cow-weed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions of North America. It has a taproot system and produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is often considered a minor but important component of its native habitat."
