    "intro": "Parapholis strigosa, commonly known as the hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and often pale green or brown in color. Parapholis strigosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions."
