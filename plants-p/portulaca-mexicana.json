    "intro": "Portulaca mexicana, commonly known as Mexican moss or common purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctophily. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Portulaca mexicana is often found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
