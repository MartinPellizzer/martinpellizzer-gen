    "intro": "Pyrus aria, commonly known as the alpine pear, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, and is adapted to cold climates. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears but are generally less widely cultivated. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. Pyrus aria is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
