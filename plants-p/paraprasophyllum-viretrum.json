    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum viretrum, commonly known as the green-flowered paraprasophyllum, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically green or pale yellow in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Paraprasophyllum viretrum is considered a sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystem health."
