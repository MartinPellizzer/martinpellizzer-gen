    "intro": "Parosela gracillima, commonly known as the slender parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, elongated fruits called achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela gracillima is considered a vulnerable species."
