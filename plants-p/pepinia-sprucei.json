    "intro": "Pepinia sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's pepinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pepinia sprucei is considered a rare and endangered species."
