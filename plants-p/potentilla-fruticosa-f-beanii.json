It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
