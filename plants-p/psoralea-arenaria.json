    "intro": "Psoralea arenaria, commonly known as sand psoralea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are usually small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Psoralea arenaria is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats."
