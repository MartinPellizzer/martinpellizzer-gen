    "intro": "Pandanus reticulatus, commonly known as the pandanus tree or screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant has a fibrous, woody stem that grows from a central root system, and its leaves are typically long and narrow with a waxy surface. It produces small, greenish flowers that develop into edible, fibrous fruits. The plant is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a common sight in mangrove ecosystems."
