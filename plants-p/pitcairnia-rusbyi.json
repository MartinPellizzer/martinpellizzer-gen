    "intro": "Pitcairnia rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features make it a popular specimen for both horticultural and ecological studies."
