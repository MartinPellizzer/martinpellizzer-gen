    "intro": "Polypodium hastatum f. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf wall fern, is a compact fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features fronds that are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical form of *Polypodium hastatum*, often growing close to the ground. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
