It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. It contains psychoactive alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contribute to its cultural and medicinal significance. Due to its hallucinogenic properties, it is often associated with traditional shamanic practices in indigenous communities."
