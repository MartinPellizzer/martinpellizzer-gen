It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, feather-like leaves that form a dense crown. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching, while the fruit is sometimes consumed or used in local remedies. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland environments, showcasing its adaptability to humid, saline conditions."
