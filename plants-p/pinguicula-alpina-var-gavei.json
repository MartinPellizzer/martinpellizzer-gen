    "intro": "Pinguicula alpina var. gavei, commonly known as the Alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in nutrient-poor mountain ecosystems."
