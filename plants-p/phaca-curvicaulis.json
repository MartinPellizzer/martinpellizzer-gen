    "intro": "Phaca curvicaulis, commonly known as the curly-stemmed phaca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster, and bloom during the warmer months of the year."
