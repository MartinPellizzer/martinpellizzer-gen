    "intro": "Paropsia malayana, commonly known as the Malay orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. Paropsia malayana is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
