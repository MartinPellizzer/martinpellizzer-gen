    "intro": "Polypodium brachyodus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
