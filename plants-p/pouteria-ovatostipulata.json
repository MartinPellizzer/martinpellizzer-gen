    "intro": "Pouteria ovatostipulata, commonly known as the ovate-stipule pouteria, is a tropical tree species belonging to the Sapotaceae family. It is characterized by its elliptical leaves with prominent stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the petiole. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, smooth fruits that contain a single large seed. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for sustainable timber, it is of interest in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
