    "intro": "Pleuroridgea zanguebarica, commonly known as the coastal tamarind, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. The coastal tamarind is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
