    "intro": "Phegopteris borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged along the margins of the fronds. Phegopteris borneensis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
