    "intro": "Polygala texensis, commonly known as Texas milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and it has slender, branched stems with small, alternate leaves. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
