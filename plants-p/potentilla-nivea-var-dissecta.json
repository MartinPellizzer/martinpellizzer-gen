    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. dissecta, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine plant collections."
