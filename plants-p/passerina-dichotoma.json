    "intro": "Passerina dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, triangular seed capsules. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Passerina dichotoma is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
