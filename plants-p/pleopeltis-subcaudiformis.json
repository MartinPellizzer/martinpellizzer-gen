    "intro": "Pleopeltis subcaudiformis, commonly known as the long-tailed polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that often have a distinctive elongated shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread along the substrate, forming dense mats. The fronds are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile leaves appearing on the same plant."
