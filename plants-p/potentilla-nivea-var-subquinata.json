    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. subquinata, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-white, woolly foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. The variety subquinata is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and dense, mat-forming growth pattern."
