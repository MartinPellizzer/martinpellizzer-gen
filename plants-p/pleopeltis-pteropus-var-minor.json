    "intro": "Pleopeltis pteropus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bird's nest fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features a rosette of broad, glossy, waxy leaves that form a cradling structure resembling a bird's nest. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. This variety is distinguished from the typical P. pteropus by its smaller size and more compact growth habit."
