    "intro": "Poa annua var. varia, commonly known as the variable annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a distinctive blue-green hue, which gives it its common name. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its widespread distribution. While it is considered a weed in many turfgrass settings, it also has ecological value as a food source for various insects and birds."
