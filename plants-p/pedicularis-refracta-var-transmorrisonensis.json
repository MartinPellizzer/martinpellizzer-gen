    "intro": "Pedicularis refracta var. transmorrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's lousewort, is a rare flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
