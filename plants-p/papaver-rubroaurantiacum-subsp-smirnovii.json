    "intro": "Papaver rubroaurantiacum subsp. smirnovii, commonly known as the Smirnov's poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange-red petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are showy and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
