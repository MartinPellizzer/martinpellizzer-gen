    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pinkish-purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often described as having a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal rainforests and mountainous regions."
