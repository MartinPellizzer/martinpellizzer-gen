    "intro": "Panicum fasciculiflorum, commonly known as clustered false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form attractive clumps in garden settings."
