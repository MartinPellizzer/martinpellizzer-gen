    "intro": "Plantago macrantha var. nitidifolia, commonly known as the glossy plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, glossy leaf surfaces and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
