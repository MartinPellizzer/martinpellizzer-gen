    "intro": "Pothos roxburghii var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the common pothos varieties. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by green, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often grown as a houseplant due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements. Its trailing growth habit makes it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves."
