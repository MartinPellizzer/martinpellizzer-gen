    "intro": "Penstemon erosus, commonly known as the rough beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon erosus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its common name."
