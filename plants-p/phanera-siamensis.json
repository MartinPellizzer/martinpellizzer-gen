    "intro": "Phanera siamensis, commonly known as the Siam phanera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
