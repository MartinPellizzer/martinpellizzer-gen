    "intro": "Puna subterranea, commonly known as the Andean ground orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is a perennial herb with a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that help it survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to low oxygen levels at high elevations. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
