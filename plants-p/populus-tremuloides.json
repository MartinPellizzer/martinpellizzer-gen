    "intro": "Populus tremuloides, commonly known as quaking aspen, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its trembling leaves that clatter in the wind, giving it its common name. The tree has smooth, light-gray bark that becomes furrowed with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by samaras that aid in wind dispersal. As a pioneer species, it plays a vital role in forest succession and ecosystem recovery."
