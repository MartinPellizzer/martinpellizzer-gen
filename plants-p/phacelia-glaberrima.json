    "intro": "Phacelia glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Phacelia glaberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
