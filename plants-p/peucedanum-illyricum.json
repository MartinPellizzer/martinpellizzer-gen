    "intro": "Peucedanum illyricum, commonly known as the Balkan cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments across the Balkan Peninsula and parts of Central Europe. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and antispasmodic properties. However, it is considered toxic in large quantities due to the presence of compounds like psoralens."
