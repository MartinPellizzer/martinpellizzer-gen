    "intro": "Phyllanthus buxifolius, commonly known as the boxleaf phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for hedges and container gardening."
