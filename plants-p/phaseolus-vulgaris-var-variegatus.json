    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated common bean, is a variant of the common bean plant characterized by its unique leaf patterns and color variations. This plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to the Americas, where it has been cultivated for centuries. Its leaves exhibit a striking mosaic of green, white, and sometimes yellow, due to genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll production. The variegation is a stable trait that does not typically affect the plant's growth or yield. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal, though it can also be used in culinary applications similar to other common beans."
