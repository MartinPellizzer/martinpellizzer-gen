    "intro": "Polystichum silaense, commonly known as the Sila fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Himalayas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are typically bisected and deeply pinnatifid. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polystichum silaense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
