It features heart-shaped, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical areas for horticultural purposes."
