It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that enclose the small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in botanical studies, particularly in the context of plant adaptation to harsh environments. The hooked ptilotus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
