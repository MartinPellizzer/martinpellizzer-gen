    "intro": "Phthirusa polystachya, commonly known as the mountain marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of soft, hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
