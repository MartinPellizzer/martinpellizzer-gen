    "intro": "Poa aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa aitchisonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
