    "intro": "Phleum arenarium f. breviglume, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This form is distinguished by its shorter glumes compared to the typical variety, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
