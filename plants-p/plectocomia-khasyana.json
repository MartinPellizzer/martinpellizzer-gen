It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dense, and durable wood. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue-black berries. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native habitat."
