    "intro": "Polystichum monotis, commonly known as the narrowleaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often growing on rocky or humus-rich soil. Polystichum monotis is valued for its ornamental foliage and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
