    "intro": "Pellaea brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the fronds of other maidenhair ferns. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
