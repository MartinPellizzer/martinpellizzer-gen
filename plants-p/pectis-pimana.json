    "intro": "Pectis pimana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant has gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pectis pimana is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can go dormant during extended droughts."
