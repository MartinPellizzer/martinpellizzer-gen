    "intro": "Prenanthes glomerata, commonly known as clustered water hemlock, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters at the top of its stem. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic compounds, it should be handled with care."
