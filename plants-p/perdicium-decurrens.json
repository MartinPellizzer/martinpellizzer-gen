    "intro": "Perdicium decurrens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Perdicium decurrens is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions."
