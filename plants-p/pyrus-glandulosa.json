    "intro": "Pyrus glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in glandular dots, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are pomes, typically small and edible, though they are not as well-known as those of other pear species. Pyrus glandulosa is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
