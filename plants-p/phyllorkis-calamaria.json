    "intro": "Phyllorkis calamaria, commonly known as the Calamaria fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often floating or submerged, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
