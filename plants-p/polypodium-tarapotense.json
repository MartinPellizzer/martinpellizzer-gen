    "intro": "Polypodium tarapotense, commonly known as the Tarapo fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats. The fronds are usually bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it recognizable among other fern species."
