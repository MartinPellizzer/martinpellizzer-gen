    "intro": "Pouteria campechiana var. typica, commonly known as the campechian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree is valued for its heavy, durable wood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and construction industries. Its fruit, a large, spiny capsule, contains edible seeds that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
