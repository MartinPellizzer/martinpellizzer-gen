    "intro": "Pteris semipinnata var. fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in damp forests. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives it a delicate appearance. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
