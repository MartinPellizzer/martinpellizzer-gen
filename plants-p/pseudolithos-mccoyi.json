    "intro": "Pseudolithos mccoyi, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent-like appearance with fleshy, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Pseudolithos mccoyi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
