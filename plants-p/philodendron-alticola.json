    "intro": "Philodendron alticola, commonly known as the highland philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and support itself as it grows. Philodendron alticola is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
