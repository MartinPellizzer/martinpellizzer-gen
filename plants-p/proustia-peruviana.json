    "intro": "Proustia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and clusters of vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. It thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Proustia peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
