    "intro": "Pistia natalensis, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It has broad, waxy, light green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Pistia natalensis is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
