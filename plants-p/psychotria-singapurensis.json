    "intro": "Psychotria singapurensis, commonly known as the Singapore psychotria, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore and parts of Malaysia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests or secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
