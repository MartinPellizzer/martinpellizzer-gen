    "intro": "Phacelia humilis var. typica, commonly known as the common phacelia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to western North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features hairy stems and opposite leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in restoration ecology. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
