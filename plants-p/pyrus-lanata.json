    "intro": "Pyrus lanata, commonly known as the woolly apple tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and leaves that are ovate with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, followed by edible, yellow or green apples that are typically small and tart. Pyrus lanata thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or rocky soils. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental value in gardens."
