    "intro": "Polygala cretacea, commonly known as the Cretan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece and Turkey. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Polygala cretacea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
