    "intro": "Picea obovata var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping spruce, is a cultivar of the white spruce tree. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in cooler climates and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic value. This variety is relatively hardy but requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure."
