    "intro": "Pleurothallis fonsflorum, commonly known as the Fountain Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air and rain. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted to capture humidity in its humid, shaded habitat. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
