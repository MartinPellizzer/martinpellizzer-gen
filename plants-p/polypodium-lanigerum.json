    "intro": "Polypodium lanigerum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, and is native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium lanigerum is often used in horticulture due to its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
