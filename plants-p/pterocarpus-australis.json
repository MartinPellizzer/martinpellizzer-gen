    "intro": "Pterocarpus australis, commonly known as the Australian flame tree, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing before the leaves in spring. The tree has a thick, flaky bark and produces flat, paddle-shaped pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities."
