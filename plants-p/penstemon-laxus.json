    "intro": "Penstemon laxus, commonly known as the lax penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Penstemon laxus is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
