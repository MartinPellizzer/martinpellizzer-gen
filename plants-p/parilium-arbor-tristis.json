    "intro": "Parilium arbor-tristis, commonly known as the sad tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its peculiar, elongated leaves that resemble the shape of a heart. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its roots are known to exude a sticky substance that has been used traditionally in local medicine. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Parilium arbor-tristis remains a subject of scientific curiosity and conservation concern."
