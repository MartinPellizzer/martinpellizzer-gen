It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its hard, woody fruit, which contains the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are commercially valuable. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species."
