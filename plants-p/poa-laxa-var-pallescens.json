    "intro": "Poa laxa var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
