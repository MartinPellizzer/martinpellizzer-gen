    "intro": "Phaca misella, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly figures, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, Phaca misella is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
