    "intro": "Psilotrichum sericeovillosum var. glabratum, commonly known as the silky-hair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
