    "intro": "Pterophylla aggregata, commonly known as the clustered pterophylla, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
