It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in shaded areas with rich, moist soil. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.
