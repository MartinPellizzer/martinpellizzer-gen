    "intro": "Palandra, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its striking, lantern-like flowers that appear at night. The plant has a short lifespan, blooming only once before it dies, which makes it a rare and fascinating species. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, Palandra is considered a vulnerable species."
