    "intro": "Phormium orchioides, commonly known as the red tussock, is a striking New Zealand native plant belonging to the Asphodelaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and long, narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces striking orange-red flower spikes in late summer, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are fibrous and have been historically used by M\u0101ori for weaving and other traditional purposes. Phormium orchioides thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental plant in coastal and temperate gardens."
