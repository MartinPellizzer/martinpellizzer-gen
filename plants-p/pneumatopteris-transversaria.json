    "intro": "Pneumatopteris transversaria, commonly known as the transverse water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive transverse arrangement of the pinnae, which gives the plant its scientific name."
