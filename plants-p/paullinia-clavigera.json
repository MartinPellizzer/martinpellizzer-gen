    "intro": "Paullinia clavigera, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, red berries. The plant is evergreen and can grow as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its fruits are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
