    "intro": "Pleopeltis alternifolia, commonly known as the veined rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate leaf arrangement and distinctive, often veined fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually leathery and have a rough texture, contributing to its ability to withstand environmental stress."
