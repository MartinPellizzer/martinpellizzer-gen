    "intro": "Polyspora elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic polypore, is a species of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped, and often clustered fruiting bodies that grow on dead wood, particularly hardwoods. The cap is typically pale to dark brown, with a smooth or slightly fibrillose surface. It lacks a stem and has a spongy, porous underside that is used for spore dispersal. This fungus is primarily found in temperate regions and is often associated with decaying trees in forest ecosystems."
