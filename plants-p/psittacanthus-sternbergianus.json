    "intro": "Psittacanthus sternbergianus, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like structure with stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is highly valued in horticulture and requires careful cultivation."
