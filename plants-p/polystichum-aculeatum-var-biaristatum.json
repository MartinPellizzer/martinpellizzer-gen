    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. biaristatum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to eastern North America. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features tall, upright fronds with a distinctive serrated edge, giving it its common name. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden landscapes."
