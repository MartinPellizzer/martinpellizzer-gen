    "intro": "Panicum fasciculare, commonly known as hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to North America. It features fine, silver-gray blades that are often described as resembling hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate panicles of pale green to golden flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
