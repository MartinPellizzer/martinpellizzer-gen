    "intro": "Paphiopedilum fairrieanum var. bohlmannianum, commonly known as the Bohlmann's lady's slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic orchid, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with intricate patterns that enhance its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
