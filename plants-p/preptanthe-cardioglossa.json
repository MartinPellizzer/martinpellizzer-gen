    "intro": "Preptanthe cardioglossa, commonly known as the heart-lip orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, lip-shaped petals that resemble a heart. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on mycorrhizal associations. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Preptanthe cardioglossa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
