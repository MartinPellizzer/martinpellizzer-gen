    "intro": "Primula obsessa, commonly known as the Scottish primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Scottish Highlands. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy underside, and its flowers are typically pale yellow with a dark purple or brownish throat. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
