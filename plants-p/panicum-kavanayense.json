    "intro": "Panicum kavanayense, commonly known as Kavanay's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Central America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. Its flowering period usually occurs during the rainy season, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for small animals and insects. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
