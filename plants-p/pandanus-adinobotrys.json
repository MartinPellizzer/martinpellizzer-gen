    "intro": "Pandanus adinobotrys, commonly known as the hairy pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, palm-like stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching due to their durability. The species is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, saline conditions."
