    "intro": "Panicum numaeense, commonly known as the Numidian panicgrass, is a species of grass native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Panicum numaeense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
