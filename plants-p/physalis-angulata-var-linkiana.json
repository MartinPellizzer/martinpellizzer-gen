It produces distinctive orange-red, inflated calyces that enclose small, yellowish berries. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with serrated margins and a rough texture. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it has a tart flavor and is often used in culinary or medicinal applications."
