    "intro": "Polypodium cultratum var. xanthotrichium, commonly known as the golden-hair fern, is a variant of the sword fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a serrated margin, with the lower surface often bearing golden-brown hairs, which give it its common name. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage."
