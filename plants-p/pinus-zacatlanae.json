    "intro": "Pinus zacatlanae, commonly known as the Zacatl\u00e1n pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. The tree has needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, and it produces cones that mature over several years. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in traditional construction and crafts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
