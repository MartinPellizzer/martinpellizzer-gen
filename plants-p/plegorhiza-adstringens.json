    "intro": "Plegorhiza adstringens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
