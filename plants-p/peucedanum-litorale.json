    "intro": "Peucedanum litorale, commonly known as sea parsley, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along rocky shores and cliffs. It has a distinctive aromatic scent and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. Peucedanum litorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
