    "intro": "Puccinellia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two florets per spikelet. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Puccinellia biflora plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
