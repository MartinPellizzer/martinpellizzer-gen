    "intro": "Platanthera latilabris, commonly known as the broad-lipped twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically less showy than those of other orchids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Platanthera latilabris is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake."
