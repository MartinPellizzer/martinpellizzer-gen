    "intro": "Poikilacanthus novogalicianus, commonly known as the Galician starfish plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Cactaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Galicia in northwestern Spain, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped spines and a compact, low-growing form. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
