    "intro": "Prosthechea borsiana, commonly known as the Borsian spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender stems and pendant flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Prosthechea borsiana is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive in its natural habitat."
