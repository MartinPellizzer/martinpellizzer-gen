    "intro": "Phlegmariurus lehnertii, commonly known as the southern marsh moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, greenish-yellow to brownish-green leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems and contain spores that are dispersed by wind. This moss is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
