    "intro": "Phyllanthus euryoides, commonly known as the African moonseed, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest in both botanical research and traditional medicine."
