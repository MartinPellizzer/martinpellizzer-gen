    "intro": "Phyllanthus roeperianus, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are broken, which is a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It typically grows in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Phyllanthus roeperianus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
