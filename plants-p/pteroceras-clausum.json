    "intro": "Pteroceras clausum, commonly known as the closed bell orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are often densely clustered and exhibit a range of colors, including purple, pink, and white. The plant has a short, stocky stem and produces small, leathery leaves that are adapted to its high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteroceras clausum is considered a vulnerable species."
