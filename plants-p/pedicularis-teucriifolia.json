    "intro": "Pedicularis teucriifolia, commonly known as the creeping lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate or ascending, allowing it to spread across rocky or alpine habitats. Pedicularis teucriifolia is often found in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environments."
