    "intro": "Polystichopsis bella, commonly known as the golden fern, is a rare and striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow fronds, which contrast sharply with its dark, leathery texture. Native to the mountainous regions of Central America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique coloration makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, Polystichopsis bella is considered endangered, highlighting the need for continued research and protection."
