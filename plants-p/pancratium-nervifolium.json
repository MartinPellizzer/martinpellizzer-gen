    "intro": "Pancratium nervifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf torchflower, is a striking ornamental plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers, which resemble torches, blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to withstand saline conditions."
