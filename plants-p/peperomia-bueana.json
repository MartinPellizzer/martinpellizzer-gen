It features thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
