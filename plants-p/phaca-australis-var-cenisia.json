It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and brown, which are followed by cylindrical, fibrous seed pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and saltmarsh environments. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
