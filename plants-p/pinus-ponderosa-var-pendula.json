    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping ponderosa pine, is a variant of the ponderosa pine characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. It is native to the western United States, particularly in areas with high elevations and moderate climates. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically 4 to 6 inches long and a distinctive, tall trunk with a broad, open crown. It produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique aesthetic."
