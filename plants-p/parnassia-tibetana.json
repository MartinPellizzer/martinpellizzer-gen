    "intro": "Parnassia tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan meadow beauty, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its striking white petals and yellow centers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Parnassia tibetana is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
