    "intro": "Polypodium gratum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Polypodium gratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities."
