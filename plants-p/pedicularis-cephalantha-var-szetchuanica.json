    "intro": "Pedicularis cephalantha var. szetchuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing on its own. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
