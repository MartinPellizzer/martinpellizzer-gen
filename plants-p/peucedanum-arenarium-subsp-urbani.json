It is a small, herbaceous plant with slender, aromatic stems and finely divided, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in urban or disturbed environments. Its chemical composition includes volatile oils and sesquiterpenes, which contribute to its distinctive aroma and potential medicinal properties."
