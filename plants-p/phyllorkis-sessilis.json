    "intro": "Phyllorkis sessilis, commonly known as the broad-leaved daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with a compact, bushy growth habit and features showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has dark green, broad, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. Its flowers consist of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, making it visually striking. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
