It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly variegated appearance. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its ability to tolerate low light and irregular watering makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
