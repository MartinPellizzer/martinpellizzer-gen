    "intro": "Passiflora monticola, commonly known as the mountain passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding a central cluster of stamens. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in antioxidants and often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora monticola is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
