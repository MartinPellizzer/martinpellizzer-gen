    "intro": "Petrocosmea qiruniae, commonly known as the Qirun stone orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. This orchid is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its fragile ecosystem and threats from habitat loss, Petrocosmea qiruniae is considered endangered."
