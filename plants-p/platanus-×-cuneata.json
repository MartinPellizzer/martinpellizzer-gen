    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 cuneata, commonly known as the London plane, is a hybrid tree resulting from the cross between the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and the European sycamore (Platanus orientalis). It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a lighter inner surface. The tree produces large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it flowers with small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a spherical, fuzzy capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is widely planted in urban areas for its tolerance to pollution and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
