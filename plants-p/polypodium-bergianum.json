    "intro": "Polypodium bergianum, commonly known as the bergian shield fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in rocky or forested areas and is often found in montane or alpine habitats. Polypodium bergianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
