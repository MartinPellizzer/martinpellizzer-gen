    "intro": "Phyllitis scolopendropsis, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a small perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, golden hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
