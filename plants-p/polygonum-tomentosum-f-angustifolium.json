    "intro": "Polygonum tomentosum f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved knotweed, is a variant of the common knotweed species characterized by its narrower leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Asia, particularly found in regions of China and Japan. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods."
