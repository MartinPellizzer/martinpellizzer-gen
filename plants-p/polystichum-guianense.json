    "intro": "Polystichum guianense, commonly known as the Guianan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
