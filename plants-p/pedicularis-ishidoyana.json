It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies."
