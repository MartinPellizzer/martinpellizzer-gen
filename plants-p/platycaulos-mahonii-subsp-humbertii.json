    "intro": "Platycaulos mahonii subsp. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's flat-leaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
