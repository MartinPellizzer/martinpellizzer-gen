    "intro": "Polygonum longisetum var. rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaved knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive round or ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
