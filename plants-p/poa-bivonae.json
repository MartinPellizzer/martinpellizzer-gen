    "intro": "Poa bivonae, commonly known as the Bivona bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, Poa bivonae is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
