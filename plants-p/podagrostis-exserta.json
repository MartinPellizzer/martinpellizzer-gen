    "intro": "Podagrostis exserta, commonly known as the erect bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its rhizomatous growth and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
