    "intro": "Psephellus vanensis, commonly known as the Vanuatu rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliff faces or in crevices. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, which play a crucial role in its reproductive cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Psephellus vanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
