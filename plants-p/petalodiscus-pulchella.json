    "intro": "Petalodiscus pulchella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Petalodiscus pulchella is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
