    "intro": "Pilocereus acranthus, commonly known as the red-bellied night bloomer, is a flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of vibrant red flowers that open at night. The plant has a succulent structure that allows it to store water, adapting to arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Pilocereus acranthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
