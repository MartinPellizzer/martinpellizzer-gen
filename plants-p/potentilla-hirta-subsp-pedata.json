    "intro": "Potentilla hirta subsp. pedata, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
