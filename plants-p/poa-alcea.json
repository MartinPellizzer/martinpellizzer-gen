    "intro": "Poa alcea, commonly known as the bluegrass clover, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce blue or purple flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Poa alcea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
