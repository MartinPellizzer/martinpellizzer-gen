    "intro": "Petunia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky petunia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, blue, and white. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps in deterring herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Petunia viscidula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom continuously throughout the growing season."
