    "intro": "Pandanus aitutakiensis, commonly known as the Aitutaki pandanus, is a species of palm native to the Cook Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing near the shoreline. The leaves are used traditionally for thatching and weaving in the local culture."
