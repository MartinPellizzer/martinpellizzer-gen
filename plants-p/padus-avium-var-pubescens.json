    "intro": "Padus avium var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy white thornapple, is a variant of the common bird cherry. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other varieties. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are often consumed by wildlife. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural collections."
