    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
