    "intro": "Panicum annulum, commonly known as the ring panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive ring-like structure formed by the arrangement of its leaves around the stem. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. Panicum annulum is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
