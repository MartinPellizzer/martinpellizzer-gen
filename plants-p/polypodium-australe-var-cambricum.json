    "intro": "Polypodium australe var. cambricum, commonly known as the Welsh fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are pinnately compound, often with a distinctive, elongated shape. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This variety is characterized by its adaptability to temperate climates and its role in ecological succession in forest ecosystems."
