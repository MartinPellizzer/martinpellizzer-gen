It belongs to the plant family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a long, slender seed capsule that contains fine, fibrous husks, which are the primary part used in herbal remedies and dietary supplements. These husks are rich in soluble fiber and are often used to promote digestive health. The plant is also valued for its ability to absorb water, making it useful in both culinary and medicinal applications."
