    "intro": "Pterostylis heberlei, commonly known as the Heberlei ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a slender, leafless stem that supports its single or few flowers. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Pterostylis heberlei is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
