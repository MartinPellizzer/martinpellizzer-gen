It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and features small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It is native to specific regions in Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
