It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its robust growth and ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Petasites androgynus is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
