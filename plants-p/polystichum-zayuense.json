    "intro": "Polystichum zayuense, commonly known as the Yarlung Valley fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high altitudes of the Yarlung Tsangpo Valley in China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. Polystichum zayuense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
