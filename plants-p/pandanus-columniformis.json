    "intro": "Pandanus columniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by spiky, cone-like fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used in traditional crafts and as a decorative plant. Its resilience to salt spray and wind makes it well adapted to maritime environments."
