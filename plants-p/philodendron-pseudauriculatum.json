    "intro": "Philodendron pseudauriculatum, commonly known as the silver-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with striking silver veins that create a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Philodendron pseudauriculatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
