    "intro": "Penstemon alpinus subsp. magnus, commonly known as the alpine penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and displays clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
