It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of branches, making it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes.
