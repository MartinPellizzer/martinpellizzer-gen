    "intro": "Plantago major subvar. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, fields, and along roadsides. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which aid in water retention. This subspecies is well-adapted to a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common and resilient weed in temperate regions."
