    "intro": "Phanera integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed phanera, is a shrub native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to high humidity and partial shade, making it a common component of understory vegetation in its native habitat."
