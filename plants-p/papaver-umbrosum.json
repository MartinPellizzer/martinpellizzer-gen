It features striking, deep purple to black flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique coloration and habitat preferences, it is a sought-after plant in specialty gardens."
