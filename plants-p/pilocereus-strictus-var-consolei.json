    "intro": "Pilocereus strictus var. consolei, commonly known as the consolea cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The varietal name 'consolei' refers to the botanist who first described it, highlighting its significance in cactus taxonomy."
