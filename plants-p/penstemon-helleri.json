    "intro": "Penstemon helleri, commonly known as Heller's beardtongue, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon helleri is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
