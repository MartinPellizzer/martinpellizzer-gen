It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in ornamental gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it a valuable plant for erosion control."
