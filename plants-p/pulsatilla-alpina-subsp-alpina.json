    "intro": "Pulsatilla alpina subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, thick caudex that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes."
