    "intro": "Panicum brevifolium, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its drought tolerance and ability to recover from grazing make it a resilient and ecologically valuable species."
