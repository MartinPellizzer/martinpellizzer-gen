    "intro": "Podospermum verrucosum, commonly known as the rough podospermum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
