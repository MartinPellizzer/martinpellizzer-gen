This form exhibits a distinct morphology, with leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the standard species. It is native to specific regions of East Asia, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant is often found in riparian zones, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
