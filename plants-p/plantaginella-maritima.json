    "intro": "Plantaginella maritima, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Sea plantain is adapted to withstand salt spray and harsh coastal climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
