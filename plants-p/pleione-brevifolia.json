    "intro": "Pleione brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved pleione, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering orchids in its habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often persisting through the winter months. Pleione brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in cool, humid environments."
