    "intro": "Pneumatopteris dicranogramma, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, compound fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Pneumatopteris dicranogramma plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen."
