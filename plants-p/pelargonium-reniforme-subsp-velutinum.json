It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
