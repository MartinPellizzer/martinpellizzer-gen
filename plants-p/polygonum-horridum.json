    "intro": "Polygonum horridum, commonly known as rough knotweed, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges and often have a reddish tinge when mature. Polygonum horridum is often found in moist soils along streambanks, wetlands, and disturbed sites."
