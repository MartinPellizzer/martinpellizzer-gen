    "intro": "Phegopteris carrii, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lanceolate pinnae. Phegopteris carrii thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forests, along stream banks, and in other damp, shaded areas."
