    "intro": "Piper illudens, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet,\" is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface. Piper illudens is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is highly restricted due to its potent and potentially dangerous effects."
