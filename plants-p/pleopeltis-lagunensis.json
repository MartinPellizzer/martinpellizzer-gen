    "intro": "Pleopeltis lagunensis, commonly known as the Lake Island fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in a rosette formation. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host, while its leaves are covered in a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
