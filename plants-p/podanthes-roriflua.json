    "intro": "Podanthes roriflua, commonly known as the flame vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that resemble flames. The plant produces small, oblong fruits that are typically green when mature and turn yellow as they ripen. Podanthes roriflua thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in hanging baskets."
