    "intro": "Pitcairnia calderonii, commonly known as the Calder\u00f3n's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Pitcairnia calderonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
