It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes. Its leaves are linear and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Panicum sumatrense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
