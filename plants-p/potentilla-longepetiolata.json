    "intro": "Potentilla longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically palmately divided, with long petioles that distinguish it from other species in the genus. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and vibrant floral display."
