    "intro": "Potentilla chinensis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal potentilla, is a shrub native to coastal regions of China. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage, which helps it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. It has adapted to tolerate saline soils and periodic inundation, making it a hardy species for coastal landscaping. Its compact size and resilience make it suitable for erosion control in maritime environments."
