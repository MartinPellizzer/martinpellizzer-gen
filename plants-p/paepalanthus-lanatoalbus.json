It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, spire-like inflorescences bearing small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude regions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
