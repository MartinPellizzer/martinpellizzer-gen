    "intro": "Pyrethrum baranovii, commonly known as the Baranov's pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which are the primary source of its natural insecticidal properties. These trichomes contain pyrethrins, compounds effective against a wide range of pests. Due to its potent bioactive compounds, it is cultivated for use in organic pest control and botanical research."
