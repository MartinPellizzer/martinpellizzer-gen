    "intro": "Ptarmica umbellata, commonly known as the common cow-wheat, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures. Ptarmica umbellata plays a role in supporting pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
