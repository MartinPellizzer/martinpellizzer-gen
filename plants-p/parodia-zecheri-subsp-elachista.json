    "intro": "Parodia zecheri subsp. elachista, commonly known as the miniature moon cactus, is a compact cacti species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive greenish-blue color and is known for its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has spiny areoles and produces woolly, white bristles along its stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.
