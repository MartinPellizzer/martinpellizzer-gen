    "intro": "Peperomia aurorana, commonly known as the sunrise peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia aurorana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
