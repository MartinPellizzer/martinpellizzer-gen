    "intro": "Pentsteira paniculata, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its stems are erect and can grow up to several feet tall, often branching near the base. Pentsteira paniculata plays an important ecological role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and host plant for their larvae."
