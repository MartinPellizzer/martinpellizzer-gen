    "intro": "Phrynium propinquum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are followed by small, three-lobed fruits. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine, while the leaves are sometimes used in ornamental gardening. Phrynium propinquum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish."
