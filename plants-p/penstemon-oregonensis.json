    "intro": "Penstemon oregonensis, commonly known as Oregon penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Oregon penstemon has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
