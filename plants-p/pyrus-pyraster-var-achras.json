    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster var. achras, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, followed by unique, fleshy fruits that ripen in late autumn. The fruit has a complex flavor, often described as a mix of apple, pear, and fig, and is traditionally used in culinary and medicinal applications. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture."
