    "intro": "Pilea articulata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of thick, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. Pilea articulata is also noted for its ease of propagation through stem cuttings, making it a popular choice for houseplants."
