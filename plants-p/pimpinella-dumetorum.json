    "intro": "Pimpinella dumetorum, commonly known as fool's parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its resemblance to edible plants, it is sometimes mistaken for parsley or cumin, though it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested."
