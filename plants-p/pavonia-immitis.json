    "intro": "Pavonia immitis, commonly known as the rough pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant features showy, red or purple bract-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture that gives it its common name. Pavonia immitis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
