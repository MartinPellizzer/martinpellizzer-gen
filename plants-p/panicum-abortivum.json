    "intro": "Panicum abortivum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and narrow, grass-like blades that turn reddish-brown in the fall. This plant is well adapted to prairie and dryland environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize open areas. Panicum abortivum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
