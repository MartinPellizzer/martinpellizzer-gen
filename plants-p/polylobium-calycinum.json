It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
