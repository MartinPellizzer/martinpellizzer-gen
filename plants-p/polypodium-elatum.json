    "intro": "Polypodium elatum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name."
