    "intro": "Plectronia attenuata, commonly known as the narrowleaf plectronia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the early spring. Plectronia attenuata is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments while maintaining its characteristic leaf structure."
