    "intro": "Psilotum nudum var. normale, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant has simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in two rows along its stem. It produces sporangia in clusters at the base of the leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. This plant is notable for its primitive structure and is often used in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of undisturbed habitats."
