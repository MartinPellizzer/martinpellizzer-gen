    "intro": "Pedicularis scullyana, commonly known as the Scully's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its spurred flowers that resemble small horns. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its roots. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing at high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies."
