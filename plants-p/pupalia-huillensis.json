    "intro": "Pupalia huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mountain cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its adaptations to high-altitude environments include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a slow growth rate to conserve energy. Pupalia huillensis is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
