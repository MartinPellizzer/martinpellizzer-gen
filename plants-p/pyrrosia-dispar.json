    "intro": "Pyrrosia dispar, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, fan-shaped fronds with a waxy, leathery texture, and its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves. Pyrrosia dispar thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its botanical features make it a popular specimen for both horticultural and scientific study."
