    "intro": "Pyrus elata, commonly known as the Colorado river pear, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet, yellow pears in late summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Pyrus elata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
