    "intro": "Potentilla pulvinaris, commonly known as the pulvinar cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
