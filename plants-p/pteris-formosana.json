    "intro": "Pteris formosana, commonly known as the Formosan water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arched or curled when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The fronds are usually dark green with a velvety texture, and they produce spore-bearing structures on the underside."
