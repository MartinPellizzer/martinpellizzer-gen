    "intro": "Pennisetum riparium, commonly known as river grass or water bamboo, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers, ponds, and wetlands. The plant has slender, arching stems and produces fluffy, seed-bearing plumes that are often used in floral arrangements. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Pennisetum riparium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
