    "intro": "Pilea semidentata, commonly known as the Shiny Pilea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth on the upper surface and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea semidentata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
