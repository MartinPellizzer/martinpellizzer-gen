    "intro": "Podococcus barteri, commonly known as the Barter's podocarp, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Podococcus barteri plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
