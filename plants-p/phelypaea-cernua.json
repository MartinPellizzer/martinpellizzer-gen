It has delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into three or more lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds and lakes. Phelypaea cernua plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
