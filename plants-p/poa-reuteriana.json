    "intro": "Poa reuteriana, commonly known as the Reuter's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems."
