    "intro": "Primulina dryas, commonly known as the snow primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
