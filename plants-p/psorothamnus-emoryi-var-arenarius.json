    "intro": "Psorothamnus emoryi var. arenarius, commonly known as Emory's sand verbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale blue or lavender, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. This variety is well adapted to arid conditions and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
