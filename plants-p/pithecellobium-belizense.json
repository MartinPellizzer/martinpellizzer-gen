    "intro": "Pithecellobium belizense, commonly known as the Belize pithecellobium, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly Belize, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks. Its fruits are pod-like structures that contain several edible seeds, which can be consumed raw or cooked. Due to its ornamental value and potential for ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
