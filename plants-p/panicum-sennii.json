    "intro": "Panicum sennii, commonly known as the purpletop grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and vibrant purple to pink flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Panicum sennii is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
