    "intro": "Prunus microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or small-fruited cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, sweet-tart berries that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Prunus microcarpa is also valued for its ecological role, providing food for birds and insects."
