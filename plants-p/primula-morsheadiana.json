    "intro": "Primula morsheadiana, commonly known as the Morshead's primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are oval-shaped with a hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
