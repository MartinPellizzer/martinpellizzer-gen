    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. diffusum, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that produce small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and often bears small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a common weed and a resilient species in various habitats."
