    "intro": "Polygala woodii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert plains. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Polygala woodii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
