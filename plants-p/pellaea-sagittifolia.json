    "intro": "Pellaea sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, arrow-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The leaves are evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year, which adds to its ornamental value in gardens."
