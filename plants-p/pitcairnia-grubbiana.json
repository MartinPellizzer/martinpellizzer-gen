    "intro": "Pitcairnia grubbiana, commonly known as the Grubb's pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding tank, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with long, spathaceous bracts that can range in color from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
