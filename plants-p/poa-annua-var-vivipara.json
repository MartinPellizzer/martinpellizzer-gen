    "intro": "Poa annua var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous annual bluegrass, is a variant of the common annual bluegrass. It is characterized by its ability to produce viviparous seeds, which germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This trait allows it to establish quickly in disturbed soils and thrive in a variety of habitats. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, lawns, and along roadsides. Its botanical features include slender stems, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences."
