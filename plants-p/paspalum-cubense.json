    "intro": "Paspalum cubense, commonly known as Cuban paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
