    "intro": "Ptilagrostis tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. This plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of pollen. Ptilagrostis tibetica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
