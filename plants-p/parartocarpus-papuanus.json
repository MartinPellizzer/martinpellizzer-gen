    "intro": "Parartocarpus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan tamarind, is a tropical tree native to the islands of New Guinea and surrounding regions. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important plants like the cashew and mango. The tree is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, spiny fruits. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fibrous, acidic pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. It is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making."
