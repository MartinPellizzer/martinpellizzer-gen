    "intro": "Phacellanthus continentalis, commonly known as the continental phacellanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
