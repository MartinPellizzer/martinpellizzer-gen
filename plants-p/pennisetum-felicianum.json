    "intro": "Pennisetum felicianum, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that produce feathery, purple-tinted plumes during the flowering season. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally green with a slight blue or silver sheen. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Pennisetum felicianum is often used in borders, containers, and as a focal point in water features due to its visual appeal and ease of maintenance."
