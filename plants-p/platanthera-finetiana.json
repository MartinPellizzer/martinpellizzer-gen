    "intro": "Platanthera finetiana, commonly known as the slender marsh-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. Its root system consists of a short rhizome with numerous roots, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
