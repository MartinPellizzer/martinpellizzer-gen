    "intro": "Pedicularis chamissonis subsp. chamissonis, commonly known as the Chamisson's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, often red or purple flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
