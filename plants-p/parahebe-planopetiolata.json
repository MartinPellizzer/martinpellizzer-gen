    "intro": "Parahebe planopetiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved parahebe, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet or blue during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
