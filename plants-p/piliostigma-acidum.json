    "intro": "Piliostigma acidum, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are important in local diets. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in degraded landscapes."
