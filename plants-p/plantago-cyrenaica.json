    "intro": "Plantago cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowering stems bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is valued for its hardiness and is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant."
