    "intro": "Physalis sancti-josephi, commonly known as the Josephite groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-like fruits covered in a papery husk. These fruits typically turn orange-red when mature and contain several small, shiny seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, which have a tangy, tart flavor."
