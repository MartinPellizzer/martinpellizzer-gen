    "intro": "Pyrethrum pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Pyrethrum pinnatifidum is valued for its natural pyrethrin content, which makes it a source of insecticides. Its ornamental value and pesticidal properties make it both a garden plant and a useful botanical resource."
