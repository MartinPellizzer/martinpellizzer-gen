    "intro": "Plantago procera, commonly known as tall plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. Plantago procera is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
