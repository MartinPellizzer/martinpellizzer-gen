    "intro": "Peperomia san-carlosiana, commonly known as the San Carlos peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the tropical regions of Central America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for beginners and space-limited environments."
