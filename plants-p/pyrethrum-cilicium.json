    "intro": "Pyrethrum cilicium, commonly known as Cilician pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrin, a potent insecticide. Pyrethrum cilicium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in sustainable pest control."
