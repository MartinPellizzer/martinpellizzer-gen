The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
