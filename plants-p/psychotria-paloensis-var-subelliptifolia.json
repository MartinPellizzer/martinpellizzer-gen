    "intro": "Psychotria paloensis var. subelliptifolia, commonly known as the Palo Alto psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant features elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
