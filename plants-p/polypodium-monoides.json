    "intro": "Polypodium monoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, strap-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polypodium monoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
