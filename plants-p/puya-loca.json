    "intro": "Puya loca, commonly known as the \"mad puya,\" is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stalk and large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in a range of vibrant hues, from red to orange and yellow. Puya loca is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions with well-drained soil. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
