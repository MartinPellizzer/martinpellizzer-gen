    "intro": "Pinus alcoquiana, commonly known as the Alcoqu\u00edn pine, is a species of conifer native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and drought. This species is often found in rocky or well-drained soils in open woodlands and mountainous regions."
