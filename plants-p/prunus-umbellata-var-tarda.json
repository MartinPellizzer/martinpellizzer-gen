    "intro": "Prunus umbellata var. tarda, commonly known as the late-flowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom later in the spring compared to other cherry species. The leaves are ovate with a pointed tip and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal."
