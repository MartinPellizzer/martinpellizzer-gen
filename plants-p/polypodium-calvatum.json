    "intro": "Polypodium calvatum, commonly known as the rock holly, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist woodlands, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium calvatum is a hardy, evergreen fern that thrives in acidic soil conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
