It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, needle-like foliage. The needles are typically two to three inches long and have a bluish-green color. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. It produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and contribute to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
