    "intro": "Prunus spinosa florepleno, commonly known as the flowering blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring, which give way to dark blue berries in late summer. These berries are edible but have a tart, astringent flavor. It is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils."
