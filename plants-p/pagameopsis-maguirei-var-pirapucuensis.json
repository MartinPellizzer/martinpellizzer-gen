    "intro": "Pagameopsis maguirei var. pirapucuensis, commonly known as the Pirapucu fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that grow in a compact, upright habit. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and thrives in high humidity with well-draining, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
