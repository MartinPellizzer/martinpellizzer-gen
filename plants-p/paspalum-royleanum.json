    "intro": "Paspalum royleanum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, particularly in India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lipped flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Paspalum royleanum is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides."
