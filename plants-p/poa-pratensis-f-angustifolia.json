    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Poa pratensis. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with dense, fine-textured foliage that contributes to its ornamental value. It is valued for its ability to form dense turf and its adaptability to a range of environmental conditions."
