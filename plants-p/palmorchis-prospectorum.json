    "intro": "Palmorchis prospectorum, commonly known as the Prospector's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, palm-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the late spring and early summer. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Palmorchis prospectorum is considered a vulnerable species."
