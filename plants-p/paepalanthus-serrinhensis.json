    "intro": "Paepalanthus serrinhensis, commonly known as the Brazilian star apple, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a smooth, green, spiny trunk. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
