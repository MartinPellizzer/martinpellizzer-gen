    "intro": "Polygonum glabrum, commonly known as smooth knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils. The plant features upright stems that are often reddish in color and covered with small, alternate leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually blooming in late summer. Polygonum glabrum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a resilient species and a potential weed."
