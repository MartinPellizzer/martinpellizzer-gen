    "intro": "Pinus pawlikowskiana, commonly known as the Pawlikowski's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and distinctive, elongated cones. The tree typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and moderate rainfall. Its cones are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years before opening. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
