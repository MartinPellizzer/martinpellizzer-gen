    "intro": "Planaltina capitata, commonly known as the \"capitata\" or \"capitado,\" is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy yellow to orange flowers in a dense cluster at the top. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
