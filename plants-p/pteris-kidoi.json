    "intro": "Pteris kidoi, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a refined appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus. Pteris kidoi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens or as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
