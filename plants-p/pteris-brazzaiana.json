    "intro": "Pteris brazzaiana, commonly known as the Brazza's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble delicate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer that helps retain moisture. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal."
