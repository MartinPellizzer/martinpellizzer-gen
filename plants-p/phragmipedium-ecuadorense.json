    "intro": "Phragmipedium ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian phragmipedium, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
