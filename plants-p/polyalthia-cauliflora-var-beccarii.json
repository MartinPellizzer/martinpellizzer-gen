    "intro": "Polyalthia cauliflora var. beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's climbing hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters at the base of the stems, a phenomenon known as cauliflory. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces yellowish or orange-red flowers with five petals. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates."
