    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It has a delicate, floating frond structure with a distinctive purple hue on its stems. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often in shaded areas with muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pseudocystopteris purpurascens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
