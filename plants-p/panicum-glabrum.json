    "intro": "Panicum glabrum, commonly known as smooth panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and disturbed areas. Due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate drought, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens and for erosion control."
