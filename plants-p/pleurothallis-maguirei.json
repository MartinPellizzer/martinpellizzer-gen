It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It has a compact growth habit and possesses pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
