    "intro": "Picea, commonly known as spruce, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees belonging to the family Pinaceae. These trees are characterized by their needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Spruces are native to the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in temperate to subarctic regions. Their cones are usually woody and hang downward, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Picea species are valued for their timber, which is used in construction, paper production, and as a source of resin."
