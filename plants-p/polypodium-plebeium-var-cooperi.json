    "intro": "Polypodium plebeium var. cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
