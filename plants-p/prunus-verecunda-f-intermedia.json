It is characterized by its intermediate traits between the typical Prunus verecunda and other related species, often displaying a mix of morphological features. The plant is native to specific regions in North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in early spring, and it produces small, edible berries in the summer. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
