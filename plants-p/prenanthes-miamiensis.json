    "intro": "Prenanthes miamiensis, commonly known as Miami waterleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Florida. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of freshwater bodies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under Florida's Endangered Species Act. Its unique botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in wetland ecosystems."
