    "intro": "Polystichum macroporum, commonly known as the giant fern or the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Polystichum macroporum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
