    "intro": "Psammisia orthoneura, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and lavender. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sandy environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Psammisia orthoneura plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
