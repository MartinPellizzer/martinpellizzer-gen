    "intro": "Physalis ciliosa, commonly known as the hairy groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, yellow-orange calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange berries that are edible when fully ripe. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats. The hairy leaves and stems give it a unique appearance, making it easily recognizable in its native environment."
