    "intro": "Phleum paniculatum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades with distinctive ciliate (fringed) margins. The plant produces dense, panicle-like inflorescences that are often tinged with pink or reddish hues. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
