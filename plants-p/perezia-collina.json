    "intro": "Perezia collina, commonly known as the mountain perezia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perezia collina is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
