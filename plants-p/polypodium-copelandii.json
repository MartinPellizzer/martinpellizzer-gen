    "intro": "Polypodium copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, strap-shaped fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
