    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the central United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white, waxy underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplain forests. This variety is known for its rapid growth and is often used in reforestation and erosion control projects."
