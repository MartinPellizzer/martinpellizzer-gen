    "intro": "Pittosporum glaberrimum, commonly known as the rough pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, orange-red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Pittosporum glaberrimum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
