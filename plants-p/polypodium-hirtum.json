    "intro": "Polypodium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its overall compact and shield-like shape."
