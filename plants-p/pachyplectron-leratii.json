    "intro": "Pachyplectron leratii, commonly known as the red-flowered pachyplectron, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive silvery underside that adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
