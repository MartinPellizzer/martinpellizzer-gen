    "intro": "Petroselinum hortense, commonly known as garden parsley, is a biennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are aromatic and widely used in cooking. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbels, which eventually develop into small, spherical fruits. Its roots are also edible and have a milder flavor compared to the leaves. Petroselinum hortense thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and culinary use."
