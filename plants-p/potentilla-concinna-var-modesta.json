    "intro": "Potentilla concinna var. modesta, commonly known as the modest potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
