    "intro": "Phegopteris tijuccana, commonly known as the Tijuana fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern that aids in its identification."
