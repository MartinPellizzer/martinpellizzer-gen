    "intro": "Polypodium fraxinifolium subsp. luridum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The subspecies is distinguished by its more intense coloration and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the species."
