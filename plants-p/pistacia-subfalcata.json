    "intro": "Pistacia subfalcata, commonly known as the desert pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3\u20135 inches long and have a distinctive, narrow, sickle-shaped leaflet. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, kidney-shaped nuts enclosed in a rough, woody husk. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
