    "intro": "Pitcairnia ruiziana, commonly known as the \"Flor de la Cumbre,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height, featuring colorful bracts that range from red to orange. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on rock faces or in shaded forest areas. Its rosette-shaped leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to collect and store water in its native arid climate. Pitcairnia ruiziana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
