    "intro": "Perezia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Perezia is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation efforts."
