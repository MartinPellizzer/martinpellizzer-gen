    "intro": "Pitcairnia bella, commonly known as the velvet leaf pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps to collect and retain moisture. The plant produces inflorescences that are typically red or orange, adding a vibrant contrast to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Pitcairnia bella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
