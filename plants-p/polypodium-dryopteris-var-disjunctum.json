    "intro": "Polypodium dryopteris var. disjunctum, commonly known as the disjunct holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in suitable habitats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
