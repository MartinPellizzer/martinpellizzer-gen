    "intro": "Pilosella floribunda subsp. regiomontana, commonly known as the Mexican goatweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora."
