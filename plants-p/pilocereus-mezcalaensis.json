    "intro": "Pilocereus mezcalaensis, commonly known as the mezcala night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and reduced leaves to minimize transpiration. Pilocereus mezcalaensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
