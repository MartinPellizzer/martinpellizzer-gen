    "intro": "Pandanus trukensis, commonly known as the Truk pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pandanus. It is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly the Caroline Islands, including the island of Truk. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, which are followed by large, spiky fruits. The Truk pandanus is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in the regions where it is found."
