It features a woody stem with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, followed by edible berries that are sweet and aromatic. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to warm, humid climates and well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit in local cuisines."
