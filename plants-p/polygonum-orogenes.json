    "intro": "Polygonum orogenes, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms during the short growing season of alpine ecosystems. Polygonum orogenes plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
