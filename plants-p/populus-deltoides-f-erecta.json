    "intro": "Populus deltoides f. erecta, commonly known as the tall poplar, is a cultivar of the eastern cottonwood. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u20138 inches long. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking appearance and rapid growth rate. It thrives in full sun and moist, well-drained soils, making it suitable for riparian areas. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its natural spread."
