    "intro": "Piper ollantaitambanum, commonly known as the Andean pepper or Quechua pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated fruits. The fruits are typically harvested when they turn red, and they are used in traditional Andean cuisine for their mild, peppery flavor. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in the cloud forests of the Andes."
