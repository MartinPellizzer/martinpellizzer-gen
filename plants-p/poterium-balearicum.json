    "intro": "Poterium balearicum, commonly known as the Balearic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small, low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant has tiny, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Poterium balearicum is often found in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas."
