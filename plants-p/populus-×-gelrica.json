    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 gelrica, commonly known as the European aspen. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between white poplar (Populus alba) and black poplar (Populus nigra). This tree is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found along riverbanks and in moist soils. Populus \u00d7 gelrica is valued for its fast growth and historical use in paper production."
