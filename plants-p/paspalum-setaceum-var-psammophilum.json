    "intro": "Paspalum setaceum var. psammophilum, commonly known as the sand paspalum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes, stabilized sand habitats, and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
