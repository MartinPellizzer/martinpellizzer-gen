    "intro": "Piptocarpha macropoda, commonly known as the bigflower sage, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid regions. Piptocarpha macropoda is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
