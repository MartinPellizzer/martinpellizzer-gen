    "intro": "Pelargonium cerinum, commonly known as the silver geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a bedding plant due to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Pelargonium cerinum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
