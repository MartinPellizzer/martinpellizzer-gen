    "intro": "Phyllanthus delagoensis, commonly known as the African date palm, is a shrub native to tropical and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant."
