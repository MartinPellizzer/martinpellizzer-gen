    "intro": "Physaria obdeltata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in arid, rocky environments. Physaria obdeltata is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
