    "intro": "Phebalium lepidotum, commonly known as the silver-leafed hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Phebalium lepidotum is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
