It is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant features small, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its roots are adapted for aquatic environments, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the water. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by reducing water turbulence and providing habitat for microorganisms."
