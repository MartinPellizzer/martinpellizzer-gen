    "intro": "Prasophyllum petilum, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender spike of pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, often in sandy or acidic soils. It is found in southern Australia, including New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Prasophyllum petilum is noted for its delicate appearance and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
