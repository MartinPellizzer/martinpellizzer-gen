    "intro": "Petasites pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its unique leaf structure and flowering habits. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It produces showy, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
