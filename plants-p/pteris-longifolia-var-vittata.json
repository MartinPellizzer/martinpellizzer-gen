    "intro": "Pteris longifolia var. vittata, commonly known as the variegated water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green with striking white or yellow variegation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in wet soils or along water edges. The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in unique aesthetic appeal."
