    "intro": "Poa glabra, commonly known as the smooth meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows, fields, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, leafy stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch, as indicated by its scientific name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. Poa glabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
