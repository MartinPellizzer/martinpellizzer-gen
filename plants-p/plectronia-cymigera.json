    "intro": "Plectronia cymigera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, which are flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Plectronia cymigera is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
