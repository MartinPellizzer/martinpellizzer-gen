It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
