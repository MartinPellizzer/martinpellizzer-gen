    "intro": "Pseudoxandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough pseudoxandra, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its bark is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine by local communities. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
