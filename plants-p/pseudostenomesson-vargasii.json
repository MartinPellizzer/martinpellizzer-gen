It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, showcasing a compact growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pseudostenomesson vargasii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience in harsh environments."
