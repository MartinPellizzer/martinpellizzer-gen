    "intro": "Psychotria thyrsiflora, commonly known as the \"Amazonian arrow poison\" or \"curare plant,\" is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. The plant is notable for containing alkaloids such as d-tubocurarine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a neurotoxin in hunting. Its leaves and roots are often processed to extract these compounds, making it an important species in both ethnobotanical and pharmacological studies. Psychotria thyrsiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the complex ecosystems of the Amazon basin."
