    "intro": "Plantago catharinea var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along streambanks. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other Plantago species, making it easily identifiable in the field."
