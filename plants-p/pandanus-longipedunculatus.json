    "intro": "Pandanus longipedunculatus, commonly known as the long-stalked pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of the Pandanus genus. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching, while its fruits are edible and used in local cuisines. The species is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, saline conditions."
