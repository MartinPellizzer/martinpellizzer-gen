    "intro": "Photinia crenatoserrata, commonly known as the serrated photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features attractive, ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated margins that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes."
