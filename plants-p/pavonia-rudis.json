    "intro": "Pavonia rudis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, violet to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions. Pavonia rudis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
