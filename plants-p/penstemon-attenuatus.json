    "intro": "Penstemon attenuatus, commonly known as the slender beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds and bumblebees, and it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. Penstemon attenuatus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
