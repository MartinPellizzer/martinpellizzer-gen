    "intro": "Phegopteris leptogramma, commonly known as the narrow-grammed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, floating fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
