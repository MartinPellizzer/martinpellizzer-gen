    "intro": "Papaver nudicaule var. glabricarpum, commonly known as the glabrous capsule poppy, is a variant of the meadow poppy. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless seed capsules, which distinguish it from other varieties. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The botanical features of this variety make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
