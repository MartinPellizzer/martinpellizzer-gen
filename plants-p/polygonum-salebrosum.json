    "intro": "Polygonum salebrosum, commonly known as the common knotgrass, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive nodes and often triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Polygonum salebrosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in wet conditions."
