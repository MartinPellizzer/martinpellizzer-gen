    "intro": "Pinguicula nana, commonly known as the dwarf butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on rocky substrates. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in cold, harsh climates where traditional nutrients are scarce."
