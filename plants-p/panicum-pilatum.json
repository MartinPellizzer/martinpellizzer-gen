    "intro": "Panicum pilatum, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble small clouds. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum pilatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
