    "intro": "Psilochenia runcinata subsp. barberi, commonly known as the Barber's psilochenia, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
