    "intro": "Poa lepta, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-rowed flowers. Poa lepta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
