    "intro": "Polystichum wolfii, commonly known as the Wolf's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Polystichum wolfii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its hardy and attractive foliage."
