    "intro": "Paspalum commune, commonly known as common paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
