    "intro": "Protorhus thouarsii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a soft, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to tropical Africa and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
