    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. platypetala, commonly known as the sandwort potentilla, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to sandy and rocky soils in arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in full sun and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural interest in cold climates."
