    "intro": "Pogonia aspera, commonly known as the rough pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces a single, showy spike of pink to purple flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Its flowers have a unique structure with a spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Pogonia aspera is a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
