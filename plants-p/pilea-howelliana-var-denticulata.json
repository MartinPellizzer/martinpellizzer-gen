    "intro": "Pilea howelliana var. denticulata, commonly known as the Shingleplant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white powdery coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and attractive foliage make it an excellent specimen plant for shaded areas."
