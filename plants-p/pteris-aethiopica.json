It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Pteris aethiopica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
