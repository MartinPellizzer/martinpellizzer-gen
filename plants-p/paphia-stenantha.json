    "intro": "Paphia stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its flowering period usually occurs during the rainy season. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
