    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria strigosa, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in dry, sandy soils. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common species in grasslands and shrublands. Its seed heads are cylindrical and often persist through winter, providing food for wildlife. Blue grama is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
