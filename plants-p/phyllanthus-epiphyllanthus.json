It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered leaves that give it a star-like appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study."
