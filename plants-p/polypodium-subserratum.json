    "intro": "Polypodium subserratum, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of ferns. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
