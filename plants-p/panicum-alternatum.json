    "intro": "Panicum alternatum, commonly known as the alternate panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces loose, open panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. It is often found in disturbed or saturated soils and is adapted to wet or semi-aquatic environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
