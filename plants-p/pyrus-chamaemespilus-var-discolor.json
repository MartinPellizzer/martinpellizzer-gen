    "intro": "Pyrus chamaemespilus var. discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by yellow or orange fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens. The species is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
