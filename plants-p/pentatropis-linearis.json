    "intro": "Pentatropis linearis, commonly known as the slender spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are linear, narrow, and slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
