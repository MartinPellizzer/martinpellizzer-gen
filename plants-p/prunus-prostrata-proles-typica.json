    "intro": "Prunus prostrata proles typica, commonly known as the prostrate cherry or Japanese yew, is a low-growing shrub native to Japan. It features small, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but should be consumed in moderation. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a popular choice in horticulture."
