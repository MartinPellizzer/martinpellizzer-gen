It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often surrounded by a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Pilosella litardiereana is typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique appearance and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
