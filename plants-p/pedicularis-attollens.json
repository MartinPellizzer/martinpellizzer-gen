    "intro": "Pedicularis attollens, commonly known as the \"Pendulous Lousewort,\" is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
