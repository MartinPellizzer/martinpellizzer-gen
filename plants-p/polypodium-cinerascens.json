    "intro": "Polypodium cinerascens, commonly known as the ash fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, ash-gray coating, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium cinerascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
