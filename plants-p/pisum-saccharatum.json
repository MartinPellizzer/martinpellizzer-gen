    "intro": "Pisum saccharatum, commonly known as sugar pea, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the production of edible pods containing small, sweet peas. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 meters, with trifoliate leaves and small white or purple flowers. Its botanical features include a well-developed root system and the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. The pods, which develop from the flowers, contain the edible seeds that are harvested when mature."
