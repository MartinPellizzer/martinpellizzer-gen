    "intro": "Polycephalium integrum, commonly known as the smooth-headed polypore, is a type of bracket fungus that grows on dead wood in temperate regions. It has a distinctive, smooth, convex cap that is typically pale yellow to brown in color. The stem is short and attached to the substrate, and the spore-bearing surface is on the underside of the cap. It is characterized by its uniform, smooth texture and lack of distinct pores or teeth. This fungus plays a role in decomposing dead wood and is often found in forested areas."
