    "intro": "Potentilla obscura var. leucotricha, commonly known as the white-haired cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems covered in dense, white or pale gray hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, typically from June to August. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a slightly serrated margin. This variety is often found in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
