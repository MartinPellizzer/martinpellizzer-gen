    "intro": "Psygmorchis gnomus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a single, inconspicuous flower that typically blooms in shades of white or pale pink. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its fragile nature and habitat specificity, Psygmorchis gnomus is considered endangered and requires careful preservation efforts."
