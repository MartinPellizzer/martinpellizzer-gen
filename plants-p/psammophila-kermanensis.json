    "intro": "Psammophila kermanensis, commonly known as the Kerman sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Iran. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is well-adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Psammophila kermanensis plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
