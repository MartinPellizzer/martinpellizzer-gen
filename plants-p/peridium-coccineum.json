    "intro": "Peridium coccineum, commonly known as the red peridium, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red, fleshy perianth that resembles a capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats and has a compact, shrub-like structure. Its flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant produces small, hard seeds within the perianth. Botanically, it belongs to the family Cactaceae, although it is not a true cactus."
