    "intro": "Peucedanum arenarium subsp. neumayeri, commonly known as the Neumayer's wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, often grayish-green leaves with a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
