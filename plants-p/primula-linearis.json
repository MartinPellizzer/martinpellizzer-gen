    "intro": "Primula linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved primrose, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Primula linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
