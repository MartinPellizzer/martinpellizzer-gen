    "intro": "Peltophorus sulcatus, commonly known as the zigzag burr, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The species is also noted for its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring."
