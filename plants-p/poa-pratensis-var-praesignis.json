It is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing tussocks and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
