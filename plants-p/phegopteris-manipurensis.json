    "intro": "Phegopteris manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur fern, is a rare species native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, light green color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
