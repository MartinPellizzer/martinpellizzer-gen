    "intro": "Prunus pogonostyla var. pogonostyla, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or sakura, is a species of flowering shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to white blossoms that appear in early spring, creating a spectacular floral display. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves that turn green in summer and yellow in autumn. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks. The fruit, a small, sweet drupe, is edible but less commonly consumed compared to its floral beauty."
