    "intro": "Ptelea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces fragrant white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, dark red berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Ptelea microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
