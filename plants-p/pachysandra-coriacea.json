    "intro": "Pachysandra coriacea, commonly known as roughleaf pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with thick, leathery leaves that have a distinctive corrugated texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for ground cover in woodland gardens."
