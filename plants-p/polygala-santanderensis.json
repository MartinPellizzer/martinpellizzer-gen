    "intro": "Polygala santanderensis, commonly known as the Santander's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, often pale or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala santanderensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
