    "intro": "Parodia stuemeri var. schuetziana, commonly known as the Schuetziana Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense, spiny coat of white to pale green spines, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne near the top of the plant. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
