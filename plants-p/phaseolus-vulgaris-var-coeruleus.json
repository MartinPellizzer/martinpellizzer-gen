    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. coeruleus, commonly known as the blue bean, is a unique variant of the common bean species. It is characterized by its striking blue flowers, which are a distinguishing feature from the typical green or white blooms of other phaseolus varieties. The plant is an annual legume that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its foliage is heart-shaped and features a matte green surface, while the pods are slender and typically turn yellow when mature. This variety is not only appreciated for its aesthetic appeal but also for its potential nutritional value, though it is less commonly consumed than other beans."
