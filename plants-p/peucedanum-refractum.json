    "intro": "Peucedanum refractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or limestone soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white to pale yellow flowers appear in late spring, forming clustered umbels that attract pollinators. The seeds are small, ribbed, and contain compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
