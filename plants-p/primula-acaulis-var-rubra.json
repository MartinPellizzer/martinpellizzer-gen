    "intro": "Primula acaulis var. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered rock primrose, is a compact perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red and pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually dark green and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is prized in rock gardens and alpine settings for its ornamental value and hardiness."
