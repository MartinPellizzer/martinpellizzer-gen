    "intro": "Pulegium vulgare, commonly known as pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant contains essential oils, particularly pulegone, which contributes to its strong aroma and medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic compounds, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for consumption in large quantities."
