    "intro": "Polypodium thunbergianum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features fronds that are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
