    "intro": "Pholidota cantonensis, commonly known as the Guangdong pholidota, is a rare and endangered plant native to southern China. It is a woody shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
