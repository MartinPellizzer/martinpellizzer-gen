    "intro": "Polygonum camporum var. boreale, commonly known as the northern knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its cold tolerance and ability to thrive in cooler climates compared to other Polygonum species."
