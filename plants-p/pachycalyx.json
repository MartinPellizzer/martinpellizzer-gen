    "intro": "Pachycalyx, commonly known as the thick-shelled or thick-cupped plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds. These plants are characterized by their robust, thickened calyx that remains attached to the fruit even after maturity. The calyx is often brightly colored and serves as a protective structure for the developing fruit. Pachycalyx species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. Their unique botanical features make them interesting subjects for both horticultural study and ecological research."
