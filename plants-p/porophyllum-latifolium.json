    "intro": "Porophyllum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a hairy stem that branches near the base, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow-to-white composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its foliage and flowers are adapted to withstand drought and full sun exposure."
