It is characterized by its large, oblong leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which contains a single large, edible seed known as the Brazil nut. The plant thrives in humid, lowland tropical environments with well-drained soil. It plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically important for its nut production."
