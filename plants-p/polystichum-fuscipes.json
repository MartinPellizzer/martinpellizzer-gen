    "intro": "Polystichum fuscipes, commonly known as the dark-footed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polystichum fuscipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
