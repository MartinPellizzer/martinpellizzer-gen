    "intro": "Pitcairnia multiflora, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that often branch out into clusters of fleshy, pointed leaves. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the holiday season, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
