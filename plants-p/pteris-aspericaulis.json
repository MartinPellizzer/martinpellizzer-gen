    "intro": "Pteris aspericaulis, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are covered in tiny, rough, spiny scales. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a feathery appearance and a dark green color. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season."
