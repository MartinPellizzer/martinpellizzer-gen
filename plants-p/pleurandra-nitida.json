It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, waxy, light green to white leaves that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Pleurandra nitida is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
