    "intro": "Pronephrium simplex var. trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain freshwater habitats. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has a simple, herbaceous morphology with trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it in aquatic environments while absorbing nutrients from the water. The species is notable for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments through its carnivorous behavior."
