It produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe, usually in late summer. The fruit is characterized by its tart flavor and high acidity, making it ideal for cooking and preserving. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other cherry species. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it flowers with pink to white blossoms in the spring."
