It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Pyxidaria limosa thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
