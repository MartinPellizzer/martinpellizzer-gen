    "intro": "Pleiotaxis argentea, commonly known as silver pleiotaxis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pleiotaxis argentea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
