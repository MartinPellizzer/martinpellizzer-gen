    "intro": "Pilea semidentata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf pilea, is a compact, low-growing houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are slightly notched along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are rarely seen above the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
