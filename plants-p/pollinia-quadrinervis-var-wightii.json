    "intro": "Pollinia quadrinervis var. wightii, commonly known as the Wight's Quadrinerved Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique pollinarium structure. The plant features a compact, sympodial growth habit with fleshy, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically arranged in a racemose inflorescence, with showy, pale yellow to greenish petals and sepals. The pollinia are clustered in a distinctive quadrinerved arrangement, which is an adaptation for specific pollination mechanisms. This orchid is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories."
