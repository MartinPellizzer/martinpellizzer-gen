It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in humid, lowland forest environments. The plant is characterized by its elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces small, round fruits that are edible and contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
