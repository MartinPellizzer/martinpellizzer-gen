    "intro": "Plantago \u00d7 valbusae, commonly known as the hybrid plantain, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Plantago lanceolata and Plantago ovata. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in cultivated fields, and is often found in temperate regions. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with both male and female reproductive structures present. While it does not produce viable seeds, it can spread through vegetative means, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings."
