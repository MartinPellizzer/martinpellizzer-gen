    "intro": "Polystichum kadyrovii, commonly known as the Kadyrov's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polystichum kadyrovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
