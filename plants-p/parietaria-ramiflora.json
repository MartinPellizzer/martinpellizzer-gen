    "intro": "Parietaria ramiflora, commonly known as the branched wallwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its reproductive system relies on wind pollination, which is common among plants in its family. Parietaria ramiflora is often found growing on walls and in damp areas, where it forms dense mats."
