    "intro": "Pygeum oocarpum, commonly known as the African wild almond, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, round, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, woody shell. Pygeum oocarpum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought resistance through its deep root system and waxy leaf surface. It is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
