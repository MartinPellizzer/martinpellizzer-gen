It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in wetland environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear reddish-purple flowers, which are distinctive and attractive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds to its ornamental value. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged soils."
