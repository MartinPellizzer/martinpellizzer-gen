It belongs to the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, providing structural support in its native habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
