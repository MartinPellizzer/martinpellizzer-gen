    "intro": "Pereskia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian cactus or the evergreen cactus, is a species of cactus native to Colombia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered with a layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a feature common in many cacti, though it retains some foliage near the base. Pereskia colombiana is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or dry forest areas."
