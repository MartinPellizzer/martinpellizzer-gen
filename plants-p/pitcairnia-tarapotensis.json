    "intro": "Pitcairnia tarapotensis, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or tree trunks. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in the summer months and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
