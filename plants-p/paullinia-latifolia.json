    "intro": "Paullinia latifolia, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree or erva-de-s\u00e3o-jo\u00e3o, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are broadly ovate and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
