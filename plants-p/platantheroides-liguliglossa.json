    "intro": "Platantheroides liguliglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces a single, narrow, greenish-white flower with a distinctive lip that is shorter than the rest of the flower. It is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
