It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it thrives on specific substrates like decaying wood. Its botanical features include long, slender stems and a complex root system adapted for nutrient absorption in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
