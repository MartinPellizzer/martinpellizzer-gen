    "intro": "Pterostylis neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, greenish-brown flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has a short, stocky rhizome with a single leaf. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
