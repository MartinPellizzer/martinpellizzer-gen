It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively short, upright stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. Phreatia brevis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its roots are typically fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil."
