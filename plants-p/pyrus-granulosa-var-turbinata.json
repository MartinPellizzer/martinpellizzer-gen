It features narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, granular bumps, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The variety is noted for its compact growth habit and ornamental value, especially during the flowering season."
