    "intro": "Pteris puberula, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Pteris puberula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
