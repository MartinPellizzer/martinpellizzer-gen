    "intro": "Palaquium microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf starfruit or small-leaved starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by star-shaped fruits, which are edible and have a tangy, citrus-like flavor. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
