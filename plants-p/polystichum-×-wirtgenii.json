    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 wirtgenii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum acutiforme. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled and tightly packed, forming a dense, ornamental clump. The plant is evergreen and thrives in shady, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its fronds are typically shorter and more compact compared to its parent species, and it rarely produces spores due to its sterility. Polystichum \u00d7 wirtgenii is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation in shaded garden settings."
