    "intro": "Passiflora alba, commonly known as the white passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers with intricate structures, including a crown of filaments and a central corona. The plant produces small, greenish-white fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are covered in fine hairs. Passiflora alba is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
