    "intro": "Polypodium lineare subsp. ussuriense, commonly known as the Ussuri cliff fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
