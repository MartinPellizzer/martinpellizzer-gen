    "intro": "Pholiurus, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Pholiurus bidentatus, which is native to parts of Asia and Africa. These plants are characterized by their stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Pholiurus species are often found in moist, shady environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
