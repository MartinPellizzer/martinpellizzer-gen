    "intro": "Physaria fremontii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. Physaria fremontii is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
