    "intro": "Primula biondiana, commonly known as the White Primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Primula biondiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
