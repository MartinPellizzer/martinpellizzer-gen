    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. juncoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
