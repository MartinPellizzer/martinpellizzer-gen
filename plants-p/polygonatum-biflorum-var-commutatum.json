    "intro": "Polygonatum biflorum var. commutatum, commonly known as the red-flowered Solomon's seal, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features long, arching stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
