It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that resemble coral. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative trailing plant. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds and insects, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
