    "intro": "Pyrus pellucida, commonly known as the silverleaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the summer. Its leaves are typically oval with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Pyrus pellucida is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
