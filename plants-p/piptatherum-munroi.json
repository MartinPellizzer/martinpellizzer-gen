    "intro": "Piptatherum munroi, commonly known as the dwarf oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
