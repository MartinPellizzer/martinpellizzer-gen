    "intro": "Pyrostria cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf pyrostria, is a unique tropical plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking heart-shaped leaves, which are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
