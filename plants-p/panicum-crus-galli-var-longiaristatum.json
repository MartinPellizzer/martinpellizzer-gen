    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. longiaristatum, commonly known as the slender barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in loose panicles, with each spikelet bearing two to three bracteate florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important weed in many crop ecosystems."
