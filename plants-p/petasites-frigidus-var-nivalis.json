    "intro": "Petasites frigidus var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a single umbel. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its native habitat."
