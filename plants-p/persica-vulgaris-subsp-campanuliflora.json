    "intro": "Persica vulgaris subsp. campanuliflora, commonly known as the campanuliflorous peach, is a subspecies of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. It features bell-shaped flowers, which give it its common name, and typically blooms in the spring. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The fruit, while similar to the common peach, is generally smaller and has a more delicate flavor."
