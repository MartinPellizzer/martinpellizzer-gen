    "intro": "Pleurothallis transversilabia, commonly known as the transverse-labia orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
