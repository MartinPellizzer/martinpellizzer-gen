    "intro": "Payena junghuhniana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its large, simple leaves that are typically alternate and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and wood are valued for their high quality and have been used in traditional medicine and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
