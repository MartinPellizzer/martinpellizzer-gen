It is characterized by its minimal foliage, with only a few leaves emerging from its short, woody stem. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, often displaying a striking contrast in coloration. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
