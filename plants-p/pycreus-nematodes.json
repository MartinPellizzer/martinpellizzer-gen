    "intro": "Pycreus nematodes, commonly known as root-knot nematodes, are microscopic parasitic worms that primarily infect the roots of plants. These nematodes belong to the genus Meloidogyne and are known for causing significant damage to a wide range of crops. They feed on plant cells, leading to the formation of galls or knots on the roots, which can severely impair water and nutrient uptake. The life cycle of Pycreus nematodes involves egg-laying in the soil, hatching into larvae, and then infecting plant roots. Due to their impact on agriculture, managing these nematodes is crucial for maintaining healthy plant growth."
