    "intro": "Pleurothallis kareniae, commonly known as Karen's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has linear, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, nodding flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
