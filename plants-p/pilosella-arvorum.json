    "intro": "Pilosella arvorum, commonly known as the woodland mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers are white to pale yellow. Pilosella arvorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
