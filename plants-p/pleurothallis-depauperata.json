    "intro": "Pleurothallis depauperata, commonly known as the poor orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in small inflorescences. It has relatively simple foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to its low light requirements and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
