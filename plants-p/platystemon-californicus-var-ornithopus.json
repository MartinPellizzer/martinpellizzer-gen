    "intro": "Platystemon californicus var. ornithopus, commonly known as the California goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage that persists throughout the year. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
