    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense var. verrucosum, commonly known as the rough field sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of small, wart-like structures. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive surface features and ecological adaptability."
