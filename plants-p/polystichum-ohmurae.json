It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. Polystichum ohmurae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
