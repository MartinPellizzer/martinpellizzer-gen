    "intro": "Pinus donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is a small evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structures typical of the pine family. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its cones are woody and release seeds in the fall, contributing to its limited reproductive success. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
