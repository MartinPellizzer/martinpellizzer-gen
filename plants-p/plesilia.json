    "intro": "Plesilia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. Plesilia species are typically found in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, thriving in saline and well-drained conditions. The plants have a compact growth habit and are often used in coastal landscaping for their hardiness and ornamental value. They play an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
