    "intro": "Polystichum michelii, commonly known as the Michel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and streamside habitats. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the soil. The spores are released from the fertile fronds, which are typically found on the upper portion of the plant."
