    "intro": "Poa jelskii, commonly known as the Jelski's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Poa jelskii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
