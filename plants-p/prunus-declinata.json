    "intro": "Prunus declinata, commonly known as the drooping cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches that create a distinctive, cascading shape. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet cherries. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the autumn. Prunus declinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
