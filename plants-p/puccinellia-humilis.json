    "intro": "Puccinellia humilis, commonly known as the common sea-bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes, estuaries, and salt meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Puccinellia humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
