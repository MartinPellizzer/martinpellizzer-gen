    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium adnatum, commonly known as the sticky goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help to deter herbivores. Pseudognaphalium adnatum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
