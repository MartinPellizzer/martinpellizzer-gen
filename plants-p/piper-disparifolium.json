    "intro": "Piper disparifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that vary in shape and size, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its fruit is a small, three-lobed berry. Piper disparifolium is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
