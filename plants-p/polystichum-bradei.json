    "intro": "Polystichum bradei, commonly known as the Brade's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polystichum bradei is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
