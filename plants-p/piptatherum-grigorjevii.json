    "intro": "Piptatherum grigorjevii, commonly known as the Armenian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
