    "intro": "Pennisetum javanicum, commonly known as the purple fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, purple-pink plumes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a decorative and sometimes invasive species. Pennisetum javanicum is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a source of thatching in some regions."
