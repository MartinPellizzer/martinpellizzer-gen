    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered blackthorn, is a cultivar of the blackthorn plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of double white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. Its flowers are showy and attract pollinators, while its berries, though edible, are generally tart and less commonly consumed by humans. The plant is often used in hedges or as a decorative element in gardens due to its hardy nature and visual appeal."
