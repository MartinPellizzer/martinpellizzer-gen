    "intro": "Pellionia griffithiana var. glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed pellionia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in smooth, glabrous skin, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny white or pale green petals, and it is often grown for its attractive foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is a popular choice for woodland gardens."
