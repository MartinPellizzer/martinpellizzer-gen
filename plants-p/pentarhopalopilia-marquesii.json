    "intro": "Pentarhopalopilia marquesii, commonly known as the Marquesan star-flower, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Marquesas in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, clustered flowers. It is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
