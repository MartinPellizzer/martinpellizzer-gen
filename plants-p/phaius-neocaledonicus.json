    "intro": "Phaius neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian orchid, is a striking plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical rainforest habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often growing in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. This orchid is highly sought after by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique botanical features."
