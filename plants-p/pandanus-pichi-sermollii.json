    "intro": "Pandanus pichi-sermollii, commonly known as the Bornean screw pine, is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. The plant typically grows in coastal and wetland areas, where it thrives in humid, saline environments. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The fruit, which is small and fleshy, is edible and contains seeds that are dispersed by water and animals."
