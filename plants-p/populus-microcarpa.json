    "intro": "Populus microcarpa, commonly known as the Mexican poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Populus microcarpa is valued for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
