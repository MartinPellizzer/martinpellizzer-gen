It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking, waxy, dark green leaves that often have a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, which are followed by distinctive, elongated berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate to high humidity to flourish. Peperomia cataractigaudens is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
