    "intro": "Pinalia leavittii, commonly known as the Leavitt's pinyon, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils within arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its leaves are needle-like, evergreen, and adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Pinalia leavittii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
