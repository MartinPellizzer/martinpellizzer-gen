It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deep underground. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
