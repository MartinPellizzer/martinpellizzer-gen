    "intro": "Pennisetum rigidum, commonly known as purple lovegrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a bluish-green color. The plant produces dense clusters of purple to pink flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, contributing to its ecological value in arid environments."
