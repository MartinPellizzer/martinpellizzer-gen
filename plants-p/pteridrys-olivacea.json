    "intro": "Pteridrys olivacea, commonly known as the olive fern, is a member of the family Davalliaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to olive in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
