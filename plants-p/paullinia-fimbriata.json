    "intro": "Paullinia fimbriata, commonly known as the Brazilian soursop or the cupua\u00e7u tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon basin. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to a soursop but has a distinct flavor and is used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include a woody stem, compound leaves, and a fruit with a rough, spiny exterior. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
