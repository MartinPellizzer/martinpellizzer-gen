    "intro": "Polystichum acutidens, commonly known as the sharp-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments with sharp, pointed lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, retaining their color throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
