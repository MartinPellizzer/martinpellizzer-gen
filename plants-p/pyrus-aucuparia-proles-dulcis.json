    "intro": "Pyrus aucuparia proles dulcis, commonly known as the hazelnut tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by hard, woody nuts that mature in the fall. The plant is valued for its edible nuts, which are rich in healthy fats, protein, and various nutrients. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped with a rough texture. The hazelnut tree thrives in well-drained soil and is often cultivated for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
