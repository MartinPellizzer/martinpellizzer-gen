    "intro": "Pilosella capillata subsp. canovasconica, commonly known as the Canovasconic cat's-tail, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact, composite head. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It is a perennial species that produces small, cylindrical flower heads, which are often mistaken for cat's-tails due to their shape. Pilosella capillata subsp. canovasconica is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
