    "intro": "Polypodium cultratum var. brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical variety. The fronds are divided into numerous narrow segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
