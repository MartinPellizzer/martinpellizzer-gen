    "intro": "Pseudais, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often pale or translucent appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are small and delicate, often resembling the shape of a ghost or shadow, hence its common name. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, Pseudais is considered a challenging plant to cultivate and study."
