    "intro": "Podospermum aksarayense, commonly known as the Aksaray starflower, is a rare and endemic species native to Turkey. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped flowers and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in mountainous regions. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
