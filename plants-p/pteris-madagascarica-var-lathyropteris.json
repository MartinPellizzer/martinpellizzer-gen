    "intro": "Pteris madagascarica var. lathyropteris, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pteris. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
