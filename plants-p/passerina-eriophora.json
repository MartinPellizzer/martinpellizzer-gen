    "intro": "Passerina eriophora, commonly known as the woolly pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, hairy layer that helps reduce water loss. Passerina eriophora is often found in meadows and open woodlands at higher elevations."
