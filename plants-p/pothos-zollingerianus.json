    "intro": "Pothos zollingerianus, commonly known as the Zollinger's pothos, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are not particularly showy, followed by round, green berries. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ornamental value. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and spread quickly, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trained on trellises."
