    "intro": "Potentilla argyrophylla var. genuina, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
