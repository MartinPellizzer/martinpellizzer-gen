    "intro": "Prunus grisea var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silverleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate, with a serrated margin and a dense silvery-gray pubescence that gives the plant its common name. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. The plant is also valued for its edible fruits, though they are typically small and not widely cultivated for commercial use."
