    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion dilatatum, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
