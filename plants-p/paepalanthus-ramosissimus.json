It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, spathaceous inflorescences. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, forming a rosette that helps collect and retain moisture. Paepalanthus ramosissimus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions."
