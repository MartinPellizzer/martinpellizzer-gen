    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subsp. lensaei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, lens-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution."
