    "intro": "Paepalanthus celsus, commonly known as the Celsus's pincushion plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiky rosette of leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common in bromeliads. It produces vibrant red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Paepalanthus celsus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments."
