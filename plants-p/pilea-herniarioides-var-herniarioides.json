    "intro": "Pilea herniarioides var. herniarioides, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
