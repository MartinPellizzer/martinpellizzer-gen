    "intro": "Perezia pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved perezia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
