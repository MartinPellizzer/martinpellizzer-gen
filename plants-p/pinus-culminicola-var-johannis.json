    "intro": "Pinus culminicola var. johannis, commonly known as the Johann's mountain pine, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of other pine species. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky slopes or in mountainous regions. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
