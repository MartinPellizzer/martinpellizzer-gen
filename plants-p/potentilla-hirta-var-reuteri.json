    "intro": "Potentilla hirta var. reuteri, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade. The species is also known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
