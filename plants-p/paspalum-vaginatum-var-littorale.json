    "intro": "Paspalum vaginatum var. littorale, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes, tidal flats, and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps stabilize soils and prevent erosion in coastal areas. It is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
