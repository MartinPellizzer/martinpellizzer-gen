    "intro": "Plectrachne caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of rice-like seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often found in areas with seasonal flooding."
