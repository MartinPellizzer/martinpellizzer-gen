    "intro": "Pilosella medioposita, commonly known as the central European mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which give it its common name, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Pilosella medioposita is often found in calcareous soils and is part of the Asteraceae family. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient species in its native habitat."
