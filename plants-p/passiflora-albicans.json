    "intro": "Passiflora albicans, commonly known as the white passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and emit a mild fragrance. The plant produces edible, white to pale yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, while its stems are woody and often have a slightly rough texture. This species is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties."
