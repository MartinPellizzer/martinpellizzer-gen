    "intro": "Potentilla hirta genuina, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically from May to June. Its leaves are palmately divided into five lobes, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Potentilla hirta genuina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas."
