It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces seed capsules that release tiny seeds for propagation. This variety is noted for its adaptability to arid environments and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
