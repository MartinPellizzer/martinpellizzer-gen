    "intro": "Picea sitchensis f. speciosa, commonly known as the Sitka white cedar, is a variant of the Sitka spruce, characterized by its distinctive white, fibrous bark. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southeastern Alaska and western Canada. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical Sitka spruce. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This botanical variant is valued for its ecological role and historical use by indigenous peoples."
