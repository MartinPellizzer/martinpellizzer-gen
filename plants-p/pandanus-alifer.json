    "intro": "Pandanus alifer, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are followed by the development of small, round fruits that are often used in traditional cuisine. Its adaptability to coastal and sandy soils makes it a common sight in island environments."
