    "intro": "Potentilla agrimonioides subsp. oreodoxa, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, persistent fruits that disperse seeds via wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
