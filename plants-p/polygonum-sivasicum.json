    "intro": "Polygonum sivasicum, commonly known as Sivasiyak, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and wet meadows. The plant features prostrate or ascending stems that can reach up to 30 cm in height, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are lanceolate to ovate, with hairy surfaces, and small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Polygonum sivasicum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
