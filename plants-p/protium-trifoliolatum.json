    "intro": "Protium trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaved sandarac tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Its bark is valued for its resin, which has been used historically in incense and varnishes. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
