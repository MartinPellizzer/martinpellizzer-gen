    "intro": "Pithecellobium havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's pithecellobium, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces edible pods containing small, sweet, seed-like fruits that are often consumed raw or cooked. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and nutritional properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for local food use."
