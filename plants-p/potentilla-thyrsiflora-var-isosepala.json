    "intro": "Potentilla thyrsiflora var. isosepala, commonly known as the slender thimbleweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, thimble-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its isosepale structure, where the sepals are nearly equal in size to the petals."
