    "intro": "Poa sterilis, commonly known as the sterile bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa sterilis is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
