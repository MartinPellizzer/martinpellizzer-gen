    "intro": "Polystachya villosula, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Polystachyaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact, club-shaped growth habit. Native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in forest understories and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
