    "intro": "Persica vulgaris leucocarpa, commonly known as the white peach. This variant of the peach tree is characterized by its pale pink to white flesh, which sets it apart from the more common yellow or orange-fleshed peaches. The plant produces small, round fruits with a smooth, thin skin that is typically pale in color. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The flowers are usually white or light pink, contributing to its ornamental value in addition to its edible fruit."
