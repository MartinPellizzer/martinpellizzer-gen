    "intro": "Prosaptia pensilis, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a delicate, epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees or along rocky surfaces. The plant features feathery, finely divided fronds that give it a light, airy appearance. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Prosaptia pensilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add a lush, green texture to indoor or outdoor spaces."
