    "intro": "Pinus tenuifolia, commonly known as the coast redwood, is a species of conifer native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically less than an inch in length. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal forests. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the humid, foggy conditions of its native habitat."
