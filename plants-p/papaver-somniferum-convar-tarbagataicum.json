    "intro": "Papaver somniferum convar. tarbagataicum, commonly known as the Tarbagatai poppy, is a botanical variant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red flowers and a robust, erect stem. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain opium latex, similar to other opium poppy varieties. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its potential for opiate production, it is subject to strict regulatory control in many regions."
