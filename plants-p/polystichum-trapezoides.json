    "intro": "Polystichum trapezoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a rusty-brown margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and thrives in acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown indusium. Polystichum trapezoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its elegant, upright growth habit."
