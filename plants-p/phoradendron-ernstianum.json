    "intro": "Phoradendron ernstianum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval leaves and white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds that aid in seed dispersal. This plant plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and supporting wildlife."
