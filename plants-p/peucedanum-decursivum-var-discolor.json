    "intro": "Peucedanum decursivum var. discolor, commonly known as the variable cow parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small and oval, with a smooth surface, and are dispersed by wind. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
