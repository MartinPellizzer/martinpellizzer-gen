    "intro": "Pleopeltis orientalis, commonly known as the oriental rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that often grow on rocks or trees. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous roots, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Pleopeltis orientalis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
