    "intro": "Phaca frigida var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and also covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This variety is well adapted to cold climates, thriving in full sun and well-drained, rocky soils."
