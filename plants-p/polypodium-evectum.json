    "intro": "Polypodium evectum, commonly known as the Mexican cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium evectum is native to Central and South America, where it plays a role in the ecological diversity of tropical and subtropical regions."
