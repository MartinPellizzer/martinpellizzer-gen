    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Ptelea trifoliolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
