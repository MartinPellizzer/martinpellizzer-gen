    "intro": "Poa trivialis f. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically thrives in cool, moist environments. This subspecies is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit. It often forms dense mats in alpine and subalpine regions, contributing to soil stabilization. Botanically, it is distinguished by its narrow leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences."
