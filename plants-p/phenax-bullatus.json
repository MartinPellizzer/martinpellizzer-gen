It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is native to specific regions in southern Africa. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phenax bullatus is considered a threatened species."
