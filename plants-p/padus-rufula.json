    "intro": "Padus rufula, commonly known as the white-flowered dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy white bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers, which are actually clustered in an inflorescence called a cyme. The plant produces red drupes in the fall, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Padus rufula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
