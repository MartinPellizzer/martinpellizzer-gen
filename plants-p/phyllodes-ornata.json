    "intro": "Phyllodes ornata, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are modified stems that perform the function of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. The golden wattle is the national floral emblem of Australia and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value."
