    "intro": "Phleum paniculatum subsp. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and silky-haired leaves and panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable forage plant for livestock."
