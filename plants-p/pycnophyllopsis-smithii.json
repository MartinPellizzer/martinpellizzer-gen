    "intro": "Pycnophyllopsis smithii, commonly known as the Smith's dense-leaf fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
