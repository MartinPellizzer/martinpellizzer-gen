    "intro": "Portulaca tenera, commonly known as the moss rose, is a flowering plant native to Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. It is a succulent annual or perennial plant characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant thrives in hot, arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its flowers typically bloom in summer, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Portulaca tenera is often used in ornamental gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
