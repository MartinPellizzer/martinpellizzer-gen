    "intro": "Pimpinella bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's cow-wheat, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
