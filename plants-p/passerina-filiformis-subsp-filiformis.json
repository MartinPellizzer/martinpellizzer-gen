    "intro": "Passerina filiformis subsp. filiformis, commonly known as the slender pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding inflorescences and lanceolate, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
