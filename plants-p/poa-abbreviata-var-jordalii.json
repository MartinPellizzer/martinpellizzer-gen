    "intro": "Poa abbreviata var. jordalii, commonly known as Jordan's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. The plant is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded mountainous areas."
