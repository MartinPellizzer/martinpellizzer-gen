    "intro": "Prasium majus f. liparitanum, commonly known as the Liparitanum form of the greater prasium, is a rare and unique variant of the prasium genus. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lanceolate leaves with a bluish-green hue. This form is native to specific alpine regions in the Balkans, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
