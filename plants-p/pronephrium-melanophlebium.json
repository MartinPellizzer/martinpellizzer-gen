    "intro": "Pronephrium melanophlebium, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive dark green fronds with prominent, blackish veins. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are typically pinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
