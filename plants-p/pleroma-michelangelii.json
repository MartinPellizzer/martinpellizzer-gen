    "intro": "Pleroma michelangelii, commonly known as the Michelangelo's pleroma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleroma michelangelii is considered a species of conservation concern."
