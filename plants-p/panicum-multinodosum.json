    "intro": "Panicum multinodosum, commonly known as the nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a rough texture that aids in water conservation. Panicum multinodosum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
