    "intro": "Pimpinella bengalensis, commonly known as Indian cumin or wild cumin, is a flowering plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellowish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. The seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cumin, though less commonly."
