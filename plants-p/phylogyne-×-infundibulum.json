    "intro": "Phylogyne \u00d7 infundibulum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a cross between two orchid species, typically Phalaenopsis and Vanda. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often have a unique combination of colors and patterns. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in segments rather than from a single point. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, typical of epiphytic orchids. The botanical name reflects its hybrid origin, with \"\u00d7\" indicating a cross between different species."
