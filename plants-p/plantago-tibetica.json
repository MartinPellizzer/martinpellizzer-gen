    "intro": "Plantago tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
