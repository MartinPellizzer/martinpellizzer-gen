    "intro": "Pogonia libonii, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pink and white flower with a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and bogs. It has a short, underground rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
