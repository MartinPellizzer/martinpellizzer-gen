    "intro": "Polypogon cachinalensis, commonly known as the Cachinal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Polypogon cachinalensis is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
