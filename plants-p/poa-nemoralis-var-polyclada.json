    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. polyclada, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often curled at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in ecological restoration projects."
