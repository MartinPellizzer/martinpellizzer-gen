    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to mountainous regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, fragrant inflorescences composed of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and rocky slopes. It has fibrous roots and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. The leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant."
