    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus neohankeanus, commonly known as the Neohankean prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The fruit, which develops after flowering, is edible and often consumed by local communities."
