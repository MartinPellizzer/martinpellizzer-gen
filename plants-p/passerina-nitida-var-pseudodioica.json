    "intro": "Passerina nitida var. pseudodioica, commonly known as the slender pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, single flowers with a distinctive yellow center and purple-pink petals, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
