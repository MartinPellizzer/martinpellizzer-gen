    "intro": "Portulaca kuriensis, commonly known as the Kuriensis moss rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to red, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Portulaca kuriensis is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
