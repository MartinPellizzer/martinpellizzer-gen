    "intro": "Pogonia striata, commonly known as the streaked bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and bogs in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring a single, slender stem with a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces a distinctive, narrow leaf that is often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Pogonia striata is considered a rare and sensitive species, often requiring specific habitat conditions for successful growth."
