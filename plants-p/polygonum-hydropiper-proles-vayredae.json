    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper proles vayredae, commonly known as the Vayreda water pepper, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially submerged in wetland environments. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, typically found in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
