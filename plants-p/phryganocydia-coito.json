    "intro": "Phryganocydia coito, commonly known as the Coito phryganocydia, is a species of moth in the family Gelechiidae. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned wings that display a mix of brown and gray tones. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. Its life cycle involves a short larval stage that feeds on specific host plants, primarily species of the genus *Cecropia*. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical and entomological research."
