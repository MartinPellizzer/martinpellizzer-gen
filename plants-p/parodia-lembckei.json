    "intro": "Parodia lembckei, commonly known as the Lemon-Horned Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Parodia lembckei is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
