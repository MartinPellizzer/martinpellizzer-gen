    "intro": "Paspalum distichum var. littorale, commonly known as salt meadow cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control."
