    "intro": "Pteris squamaestipes, commonly known as the scaly-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually a bright green color, with a distinctive scaly appearance on the underside."
