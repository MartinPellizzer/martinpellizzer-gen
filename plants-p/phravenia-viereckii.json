It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
