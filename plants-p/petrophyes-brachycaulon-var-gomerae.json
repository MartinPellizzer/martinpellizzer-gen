    "intro": "Petrophyes brachycaulon var. gomerae, commonly known as the Gomeran rock heath, is a flowering plant endemic to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing shrub with small, leathery leaves that are adapted to the arid, rocky environment. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
