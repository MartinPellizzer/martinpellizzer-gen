    "intro": "Pyrus rinzenii, commonly known as the Tibetan pear, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pyrus. It is native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a slightly serrated edge, and the tree can grow up to 10 meters in height. Pyrus rinzenii is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ecological role in mountainous ecosystems."
