    "intro": "Plantago major var. uliginosa, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a robust perennial herb that thrives in moist, often nitrogen-rich soils. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This variant is closely related to other Plantago species and is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and soothing effects."
