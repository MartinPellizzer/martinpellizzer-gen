    "intro": "Phacelia dubia var. gilioides, commonly known as the Gili Island phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Gili Trawangan in Indonesia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its restricted habitat and potential threats from human activity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
