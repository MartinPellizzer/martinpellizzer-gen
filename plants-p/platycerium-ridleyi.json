    "intro": "Platycerium ridleyi, commonly known as the ridge-stem fern, is a unique epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a shield or a plate, giving it a striking appearance. The plant lacks true stems and instead has a creeping rhizome that anchors it to trees or rocks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Platycerium ridleyi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to humid, shaded environments."
