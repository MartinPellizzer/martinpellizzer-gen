    "intro": "Peucedanum opacum, commonly known as black horehound, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its branched, hollow stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its seeds are small and dark, often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Peucedanum opacum thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
