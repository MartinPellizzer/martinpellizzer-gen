    "intro": "Platanthera yosemitensis, commonly known as the Yosemite coralroot, is a rare orchid species native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a small, herbaceous plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces delicate, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
