    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. djurdjurae, commonly known as the Djurdjura alpine grass, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies thrives in cold, moist environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, greenish-brown flowers. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
