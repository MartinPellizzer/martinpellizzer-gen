    "intro": "Psammisia elliptica, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it blooms during the summer months. Psammisia elliptica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
