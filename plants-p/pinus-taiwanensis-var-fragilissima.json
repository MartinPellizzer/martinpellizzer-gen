    "intro": "Pinus taiwanensis var. fragilissima, commonly known as the Taiwan fir variant, is a rare and unique variant of the Taiwan fir, native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its distinctive, fragrant needles that are shorter and more delicate than those of the typical Taiwan fir. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
