    "intro": "Pahudia puberula, commonly known as the African violets, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves and clusters of showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Pahudia puberula thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
