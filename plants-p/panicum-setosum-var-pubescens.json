    "intro": "Panicum setosum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of bracted spikes, which are often adorned with short, bristly hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
