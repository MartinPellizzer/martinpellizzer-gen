    "intro": "Poloa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Poloa is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some regions."
