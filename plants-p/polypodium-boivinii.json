    "intro": "Polypodium boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
