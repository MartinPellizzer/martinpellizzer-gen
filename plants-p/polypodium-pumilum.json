    "intro": "Polypodium pumilum, commonly known as the small fern or dwarf shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Polypodium pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings."
