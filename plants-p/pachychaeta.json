    "intro": "Pachychaeta, commonly known as the \"broad-leaved everlasting\" or \"everlasting grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in spikelets, often with bracts that are prominent and sometimes showy. Pachychaeta species are native to southern Africa and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. These plants are adapted to arid environments and can survive in conditions with limited water availability."
