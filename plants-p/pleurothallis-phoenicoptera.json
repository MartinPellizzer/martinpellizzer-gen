It is characterized by its striking, red-brown inflorescence that resembles a feather, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a delicate, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. Pleurothallis phoenicoptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
