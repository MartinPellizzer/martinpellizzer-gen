    "intro": "Psychotria sodifera, commonly known as the sweetleaf psychotria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. Psychotria sodifera is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
