It is characterized by its large, cone-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers at the base of the bracts, which are often overlooked. Native to the coastal regions of South Africa, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun exposure.
