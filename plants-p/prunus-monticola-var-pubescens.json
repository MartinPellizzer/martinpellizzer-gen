    "intro": "Prunus monticola var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent mountain cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves, which give it its botanical variant name, and its small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or dark purple when mature, and it is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, while its ecological role supports local wildlife."
