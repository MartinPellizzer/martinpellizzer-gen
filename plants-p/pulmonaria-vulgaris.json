    "intro": "Pulmonaria vulgaris, commonly known as lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, spotted leaves that resemble lungs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Pulmonaria vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
