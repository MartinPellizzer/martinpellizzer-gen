    "intro": "Procris umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like inflorescence, which consists of a cluster of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a smooth or slightly lobed margin. Procris umbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a pond plant."
