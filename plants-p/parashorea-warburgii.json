    "intro": "Parashorea warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, aromatic wood. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release winged seeds upon maturity, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for conservation efforts."
