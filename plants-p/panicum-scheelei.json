    "intro": "Panicum scheelei, commonly known as Scheele's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are linear and have a slightly rough texture, while the flowers are small and pale green to brownish in color. Panicum scheelei is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, grass-like appearance and drought tolerance."
