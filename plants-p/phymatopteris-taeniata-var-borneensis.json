    "intro": "Phymatopteris taeniata var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance, which gives it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role within the understory vegetation of tropical forests and its potential for horticultural use."
