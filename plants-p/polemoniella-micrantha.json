    "intro": "Polemoniella micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered polemonium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
