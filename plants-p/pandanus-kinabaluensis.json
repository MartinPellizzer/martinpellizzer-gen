    "intro": "Pandanus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, making it monoecious. Its fibrous roots and robust structure allow it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This species is often found in lowland and montane forest areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
