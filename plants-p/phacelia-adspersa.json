    "intro": "Phacelia adspersa, commonly known as the sticky phacelia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Phacelia adspersa is valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
