    "intro": "Potentilla verna subsp. cinerea, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense, soft hairs covering its leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
