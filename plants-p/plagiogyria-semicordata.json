    "intro": "Plagiogyria semicordata, commonly known as the heartleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery thallus with a dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often white or pale yellow lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
