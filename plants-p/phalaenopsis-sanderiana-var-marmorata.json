    "intro": "Phalaenopsis sanderiana var. marmorata, commonly known as the marbled phalaenopsis, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking, mottled foliage and long-lasting blooms. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically produces white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive marbled pattern on its leaves, which contribute to its ornamental value. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a compact form with new growths emerging from the base of the previous ones. This variety requires well-draining potting media and consistent moisture to flourish."
