It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
