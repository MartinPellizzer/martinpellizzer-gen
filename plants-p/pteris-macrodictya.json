    "intro": "Pteris macrodictya, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to wet soil or rocks. Pteris macrodictya is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
