    "intro": "Potentilla heptagona, commonly known as the seven-sided cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive seven-angled stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately divided into five lobes, and the foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs. Potentilla heptagona is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic features."
