    "intro": "Poa psammophila, commonly known as the sand bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration due to a waxy coating. Poa psammophila plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
