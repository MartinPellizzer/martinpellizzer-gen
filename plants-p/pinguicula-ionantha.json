    "intro": "Pinguicula ionantha, commonly known as the Mexican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It is a small, mat-forming plant with rosettes of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an intriguing subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
