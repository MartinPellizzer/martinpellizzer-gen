    "intro": "Plantago libyca, commonly known as the Libyan plantain, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
