    "intro": "Pultenaea flexilis var. mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pultenaea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, often spreading branches. The leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats such as woodlands and heaths."
