    "intro": "Podospermum laciniatum var. songoricum, commonly known as the Songori leafy spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, lobed, and hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
