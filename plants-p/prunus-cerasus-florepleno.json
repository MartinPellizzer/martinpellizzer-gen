    "intro": "Prunus cerasus florepleno, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a variety of the sweet cherry tree characterized by its abundant, double blooms. It features dense, white or pink petals that create a striking visual display in spring. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its flowers are sterile, meaning they do not produce fruit, making it primarily ornamental. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
