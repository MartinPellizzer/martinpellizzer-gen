    "intro": "Polygala cristata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
