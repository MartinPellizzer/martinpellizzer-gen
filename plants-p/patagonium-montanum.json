    "intro": "Patagonium montanum, commonly known as the Andean mountain plant, is a flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Patagonium montanum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and supports local pollinators."
