    "intro": "Puccinellia tenella subsp. langeana, commonly known as Lange's sea oats, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species in coastal dunes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
