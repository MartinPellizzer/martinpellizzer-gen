    "intro": "Pavonia hostmannii, commonly known as the desert pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Pavonia hostmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
