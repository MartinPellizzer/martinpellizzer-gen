It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are pinnately divided, with lance-shaped lobes that are sharply pointed, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
