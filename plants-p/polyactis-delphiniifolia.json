It has broad, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
