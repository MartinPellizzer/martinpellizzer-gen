    "intro": "Polypodium winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
