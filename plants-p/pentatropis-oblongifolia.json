    "intro": "Pentatropis oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed pentatropis, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to environmental stress. Pentatropis oblongifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats within cloud forests."
