It features heart-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface and small, spiky red or orange bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and shelves."
