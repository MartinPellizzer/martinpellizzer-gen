    "intro": "Poa bergii, commonly known as the Berg's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Poa bergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky or marginal environments."
