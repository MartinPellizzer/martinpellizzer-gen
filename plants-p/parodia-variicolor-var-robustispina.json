It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are typically ribbed and covered with white, fluffy spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
