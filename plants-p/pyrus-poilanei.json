    "intro": "Pyrus poilanei, commonly known as the Sierra Madre pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and edible, sweet-tart fruits. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
