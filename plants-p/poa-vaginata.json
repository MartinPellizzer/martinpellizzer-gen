    "intro": "Poa vaginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Poa vaginata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in ecological restoration projects."
