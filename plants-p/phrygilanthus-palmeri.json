    "intro": "Phrygilanthus palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's phrygilanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated and remains a relatively obscure species within its native range."
