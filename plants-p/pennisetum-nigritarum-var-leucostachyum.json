    "intro": "Pennisetum nigritarum var. leucostachyum, commonly known as the white-stemmed fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It features tall, slender stems that are typically white or pale green, contrasting with its dark green foliage. The plant produces fluffy, silver-white plumes during the flowering season, which are visually striking and attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it both decorative and low-maintenance."
