    "intro": "Pityrocarpa flava, commonly known as the yellow mescal bean, is a small, evergreen tree native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, bean-like fruits that contain flat, edible seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water requirements. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical climates."
