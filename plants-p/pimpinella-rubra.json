It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
