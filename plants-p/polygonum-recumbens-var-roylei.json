    "intro": "Polygonum recumbens var. roylei, commonly known as the Himalayan knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and prominent veins. This species is often found in moist, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil."
