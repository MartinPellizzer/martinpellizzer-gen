    "intro": "Populus trichocarpa var. hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cottonwood, is a variant of the black cottonwood native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath, distinguishing it from other Populus species. The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows along riverbanks and in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
