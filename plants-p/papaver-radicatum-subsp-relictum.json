    "intro": "Papaver radicatum subsp. relictum, commonly known as the Armenian poppy, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its striking red, papery petals and a distinctive, elongated seed capsule. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
