    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare f. littorale, commonly known as sea buckwheat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to coastal areas. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in estuarine environments. The plant has small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions. This variant is notable for its adaptability to salt spray and tidal fluctuations, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
