    "intro": "Phaseolus nipponensis, commonly known as the Japanese bean, is a leguminous plant native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several angular seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species within the Phaseolus genus."
