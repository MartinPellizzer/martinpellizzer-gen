    "intro": "Polycarpaea repens subsp. tiranica, commonly known as the creeping polycarpaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
