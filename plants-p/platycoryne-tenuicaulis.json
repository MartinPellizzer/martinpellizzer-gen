    "intro": "Platycoryne tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed flat-lobed plant, is a herbaceous species native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a smooth surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
