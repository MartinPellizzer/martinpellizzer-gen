    "intro": "Plantago graeca, commonly known as Greek plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, sturdy stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
