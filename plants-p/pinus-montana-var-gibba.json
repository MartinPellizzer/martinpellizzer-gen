    "intro": "Pinus montana var. gibba, commonly known as the Alpine white pine, is a variant of the white pine species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive, elongated cones. The leaves are needle-like, typically measuring between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and are arranged in spirals around the stem. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh climatic conditions. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until exposed to high temperatures, usually from forest fires, ensuring seed dispersal under favorable conditions."
