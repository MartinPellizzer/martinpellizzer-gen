    "intro": "Potentilla latefoliata, commonly known as the late-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets, which are typically hairy and grayish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Potentilla latefoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
