    "intro": "Psilotrichum aphyllum, commonly known as the barren psilotum, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its simple, branching structure composed of sporophylls. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in clusters along its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered an important species for studying the evolution of early land plants."
