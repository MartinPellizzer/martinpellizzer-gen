    "intro": "Pabstiella podoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pabstiella, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its distribution is limited to specific regions in southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a vulnerable species."
