    "intro": "Prunus ulmifolia, commonly known as the European bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible cherries that are typically sour but used in jams and wines. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus ulmifolia is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils."
