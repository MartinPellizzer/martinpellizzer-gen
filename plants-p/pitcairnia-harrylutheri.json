    "intro": "Pitcairnia harrylutheri, commonly known as the Harry Luther pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the rainforest environment. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in shaded, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice among bromeliad enthusiasts."
