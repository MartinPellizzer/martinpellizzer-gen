    "intro": "Pomaria jamesii, commonly known as the James' pomaria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pomaria jamesii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
