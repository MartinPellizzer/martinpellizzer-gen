    "intro": "Peliosanthes pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and distinctive appearance. The plant features a short, trunk-like stem with a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
