    "intro": "Pinus aristata, commonly known as the alpine fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its compact, slow-growing form and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and its cones are small and often clustered. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, persistent seed cones. This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous terrain."
