    "intro": "Phaseolus psammodes, commonly known as the desert bean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its deep root system and drought tolerance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds, which are similar in appearance to common beans. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, hairy, ovate leaflets, and it has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. Phaseolus psammodes plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife."
