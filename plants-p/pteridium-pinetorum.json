    "intro": "Pteridium pinetorum, commonly known as the pine bracken, is a fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from the fertile fronds, which are typically found on the underside. Pteridium pinetorum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various wildlife species."
