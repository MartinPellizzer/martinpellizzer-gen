    "intro": "Pyrus malus rosea, commonly known as the pink apple tree, is a cultivar of the domestic apple tree, characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red foliage and flowers. This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal rather than its fruiting capabilities, as the apples are typically small and not suitable for consumption. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The tree's leaves are broad and oval, with a glossy surface, and it blooms in early spring with clusters of fragrant, pink flowers. Due to its ornamental value, it is often planted in gardens and public spaces for its visual impact."
