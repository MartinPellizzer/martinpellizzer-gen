    "intro": "Phreatia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Sumatra. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation areas."
