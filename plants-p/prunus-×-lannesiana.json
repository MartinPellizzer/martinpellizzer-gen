    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features glossy, dark green leaves that remain on the plant year-round, providing dense foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible but often considered bitter. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping. However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, so care should be taken with its cultivation."
