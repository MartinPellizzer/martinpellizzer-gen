    "intro": "Parodia subterranea var. occulta, commonly known as the hidden moon cactus, is a rare and intriguing cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a unique ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant typically features a dark green body with a pale, almost translucent coloration, giving it a ghostly appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a subtle contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts and botanists alike."
