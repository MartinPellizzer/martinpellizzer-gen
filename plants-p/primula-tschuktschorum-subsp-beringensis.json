    "intro": "Primula tschuktschorum subsp. beringensis, commonly known as the Bering Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, often succulent leaves that help it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme climates."
