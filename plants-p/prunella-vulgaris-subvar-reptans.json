    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris subvar. reptans, commonly known as creeping deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces spikes of purple to pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive strategy involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination by insects. The species is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats."
