    "intro": "Phellodendron amurense f. molle, commonly known as the soft-leaf amur corktree, is a variant of the Amur corktree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical form. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
