    "intro": "Peperomia theodori var. glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that are typically lance-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for tabletop gardens and as a decorative houseplant."
