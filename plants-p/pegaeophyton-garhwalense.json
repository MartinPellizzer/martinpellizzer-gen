    "intro": "Pegaeophyton garhwalense, commonly known as the Garhwal fern, is a rare and ancient plant species found in the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of modern ferns. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates at high altitudes. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary link to early land plants, offering insights into the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator species for studying alpine ecosystems."
