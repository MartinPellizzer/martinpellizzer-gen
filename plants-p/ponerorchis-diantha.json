    "intro": "Ponerorchis diantha, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique growth habit, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spike of pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent, which is particularly noticeable during the winter months. Its blooming period coincides with the Christmas season, hence its common name. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
