    "intro": "Ptilagrostis pelliotii, commonly known as the Persian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to dry environments and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy and resilient species. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
