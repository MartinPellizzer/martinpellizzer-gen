    "intro": "Polypodium koningsbergeri, commonly known as the Koningsberger's wall fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
