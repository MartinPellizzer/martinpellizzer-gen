    "intro": "Panicum dichotomiflorum var. imperium, commonly known as the purpletop millet, is a striking ornamental grass native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of purple to pink plumes, which add vibrant color to gardens in late summer and autumn. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscapes. Its feathery foliage and showy inflorescences make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological gardens. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and provide habitat for small wildlife."
