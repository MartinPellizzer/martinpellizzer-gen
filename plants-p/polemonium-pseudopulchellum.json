It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are upright and branched. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
