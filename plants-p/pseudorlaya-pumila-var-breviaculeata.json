    "intro": "Pseudorlaya pumila var. breviaculeata, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
