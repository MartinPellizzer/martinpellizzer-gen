    "intro": "Physalis lanceolata var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy gooseberry, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped calyx that encases the fruit, which is typically orange to red in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often covered in a fuzzy, glandular coating. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall hairy appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
