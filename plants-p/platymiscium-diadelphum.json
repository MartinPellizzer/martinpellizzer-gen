It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, tolerating saline conditions, which makes it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slightly waxy texture. The species is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
