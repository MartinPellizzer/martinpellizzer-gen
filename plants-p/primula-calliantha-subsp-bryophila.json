    "intro": "Primula calliantha subsp. bryophila, commonly known as the mossy primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features rosettes of basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred shape. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
