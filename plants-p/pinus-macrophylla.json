    "intro": "Pinus macrophylla, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against wildfires and harsh environmental conditions. Pinus macrophylla plays an important ecological role in its habitat, offering shelter and food for various wildlife species."
