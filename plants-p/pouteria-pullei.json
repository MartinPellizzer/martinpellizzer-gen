    "intro": "Pouteria pullei, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a dense canopy and thick, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of large, woody pods containing the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, fiber, and essential minerals like magnesium and potassium. The tree plays a vital ecological role in its habitat, supporting diverse wildlife and contributing to the rainforest's biodiversity."
