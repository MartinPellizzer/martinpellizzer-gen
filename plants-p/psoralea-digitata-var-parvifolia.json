    "intro": "Psoralea digitata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. This species is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has been used traditionally for various purposes in indigenous communities."
