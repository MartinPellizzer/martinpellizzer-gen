    "intro": "Pleioceras zenkeri, commonly known as the African star orchid, is a unique orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features specialized structures called pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in arid environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
