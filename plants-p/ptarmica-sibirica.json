    "intro": "Ptarmica sibirica, commonly known as Siberian lichen or *Peltigera sibirica*, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Peltigeraceae. It is characterized by its crustose to foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found on tree bark, soil, or rock surfaces in boreal and temperate regions. It contains various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization. Ptarmica sibirica is an important indicator species for assessing environmental health and biodiversity in forest ecosystems."
