    "intro": "Panicum bengalense, commonly known as the Bengal millet, is a small-grained grass native to South and Southeast Asia. It is a C4 plant, which allows it to efficiently perform photosynthesis under high temperatures and low water conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, which are harvested for their nutritional value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient crop in arid regions. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil."
