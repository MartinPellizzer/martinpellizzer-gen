    "intro": "Payena kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean payena, is a flowering plant native to the montane forests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in humid and cool environments, and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, while its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, often with a fragrant scent. Payena kinabaluensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native range."
