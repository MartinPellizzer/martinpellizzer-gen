    "intro": "Piper subhirsutum var. tomentosicaule, commonly known as the tomentose pepper plant, is a variant of the Piper subhirsutum species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, tomentose stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its fruits are peppery and can be used in culinary applications, though it is less commonly cultivated than other pepper species. The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ethnobotanical study."
