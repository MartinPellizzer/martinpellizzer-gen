    "intro": "Panicum hians var. pallescens, commonly known as silver panicum, is a variant of the panic grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of pale green to silver bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
