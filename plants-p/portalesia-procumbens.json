    "intro": "Portalesia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping portalesia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It features succulent, fleshy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Portalesia procumbens is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in high-altitude environments."
