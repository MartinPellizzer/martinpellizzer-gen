It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in gardens and as a houseplant."
