    "intro": "Psychotria lokohensis, commonly known as the Lokohense Psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
