    "intro": "Poa attenuata subsp. gobica, commonly known as the Gobica bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, creeping stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and adaptability."
