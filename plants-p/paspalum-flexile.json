It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum flexile is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
