    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 tomentosa f. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a cultivar of the poplar family characterized by its upright growth habit and compact form. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing an attractive appearance in ornamental landscapes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for urban and suburban environments. Due to its fast growth rate and adaptability, it is often used as a windbreak or for erosion control."
